       "['Wound healing is essential for survival. This is a multistep process involving a number of different cell types. Of particular relevance to this project is that wounding activates stem cells in the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and hair follicles (HF) to proliferate and send their progeny to re-epithelialize the wound and subsequently regenerate the epidermis. Failure to close wounds leads to medical costs estimated in the US at over $25 billion and affecting 6.5 million people. Our previous studies have shown that vitamin D and calcium signaling play important roles in these events. As we show in preliminary data, both the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) are required for the maintenance and activation of the stem cells in the HF and IFE. In the previous funding cycle we showed that lack of the VDR and CaSR are associated with a delay in wound closure. We hypothesized that VDR and CaSR are required both for the maintenance of the stem cell niches and their activation following wounding. This activation stimulates their proliferation and migration to re- epithelialize the wound. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis in that deletion of VDR (VDRKO) results in a reduction in the number of cells in the stem cell niches in both HF and IFE, that proliferation is reduced in the cells at the leading edge of the epithelium after wounding, that expression of axin 2 and CD44 as markers of stem cell activation is reduced, and that the leading edge of the epithelium at the wound is disorganized with reduction in the epithelial junctions (E-cadherin/catenin complexes) that appear to be required for migration of the keratinocytes across the wound as a first step in restoring the epidermis. Moreover, we demonstrated that topical application of a calcimimetic to activate the CaSR or calcitriol to activate the VDR accelerates wound healing, increasing the number and proliferation of the stem cells. Building on these promising preliminary we now propose to determine the mechanisms by which calcium and vitamin D signaling regulate the response of stem cells to wounding and the subsequent ability of their progeny to re-epithelialize the wound as the first step in restoring the epidermis. The hypothesis that we plan to test is: ?The VDR and CaSR in keratinocytes are required for the maintenance of the epidermal stem cell niche. Moreover, by regulating intracellular calcium dependent signaling mechanisms they enable the activation, proliferation, and migration of epidermal stem cells and their progeny following wounding to re-epithelialize the wound and subsequently regenerate the epidermis?. To test this hypothesis we propose the following three aims. 1 Determine whether vitamin D and calcium signaling via their receptors play distinct and/or complementary roles in epidermal stem cell function during re-epithelialization. 2. Determine whether VDR and CaSR are essential for the maintenance of the stem cell niches within the epidermis and hair follicle. 3. Determine the regulation of intracellular calcium signaling by VDR and CaSR and the role of such signaling in the activation and migration of stem cells after wounding. Poor wound healing is an important problem in the Veteran population. We expect our results will provide insight into the regulation of wound healing, potentially resulting in improved methods for treating chronic wounds by accelerating their re-epithelialization.',\n",
       " 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic debilitating disease that is characterized by high titers of autoantibodies with specificity for nuclear autoantigens. It is considered to arise from interactions between underlying genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, with different combinations resulting in inter- individual variations in disease manifestations and therapeutic responsiveness. Directed therapeutic targeting of specific pathways has not proven effective, which suggests that the current understanding of pathogenesis is incomplete. The goal of the proposed project is to test the hypothesis that the survival of immature autoreactive B cells, the preferential development of antinuclear autoreactive B cells and the status of mature autoreactive B cells (immunocompetent vs. anergic/tolerogenic) is decided during the transitional stage 1 (T1) of development and requires constitutive T1 B cell expression of interferon ? (IFN?).  This paradigm shifting hypothesis is based on data generated using a combination of mixed-bone marrow chimeras, flow cytometry with tetramer or idiotype antibody selection, and high-throughput single-cell analysis to interrogate type I interferon (IFN) networks in B cell from patients with SLE and lupus-prone BXD2 mice. The data suggest that the currently known molecular and cellular aberrations are preceded by a single primary pathogenic event, i.e., production of IFN? by T1 B cells. The data suggest that the survival of the very early T1 cells is dependent on endogenous expression of IFN?. This subset of T1 B cells express endogenous IFN?, which leads to their development into T1 B cells that produce IFN?. The ability of T1 B cells to escape negative B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated selection is dictated by the type I IFN-determined responsiveness of this T1 subset to BCR-mediated signaling in combination with stimulation of TLR signaling (TLR7 or TLR9) by apoptotic debris. This preferentially permits escape of nucleic antigen-autoreactive B cells. We have further identified that the T1 B cell compartment contains distinct subsets of cells. As these included subsets with transcriptional profiles that parallel the phenotypes of mature and anergic suppressive regulatory (Breg) cells and their immunogenic counterparts that predominate in SLE, our new data suggest that this phenotypic switch in the mature B cells is imprinted during the T1 stage. These data also suggest that development of type I IFN network associated T1 B cells in BXD2 mice is associated with type I IFN-inducing transcription factors (IRF3 and IRF7) whereas induction of the Foxp3+ regulatory T1 B cells is associated with transcription factor, ID3.  Notably, these data not only suggest suppression of precursors of T1-Breg is a novel pathogenic framework in SLE but also provide the tool, i.e., the gene expression signatures in sorted transitional B cells, that enable its analysis. We will test the critical elements of our overall hypothesis through three Specific Aims that will: (1) Distinguish the roles of the constitutive IFN? signaling and the microenvironmental signals in driving the development of T1 B cells; (2) Identify if the initial T1 B cell transcriptional imprinting is maintained at the T2/MZP-MZ-FO stage of development; and (3) Determine if T1 B-cell endogenous IFN? promotes a type I IFN network that suppresses the precursors of regulatory B cells at the T1 stage in SLE patients. The scientific premises of the proposed work include the parallels between transcriptional profiles in the T1 B cells and mature B cells and the segregation of type I IFN associated vs Breg associated transcriptional profiles in the T1 B cells. We have acquired reporter mouse strains for IFN?, IL-10, Foxp3 and Id3 to interrogate discreet developmental stages within and derived from transitional T1 B subsets.  The information gained will have a broad-based impact on the field and improve the care of VA patients with SLE by identifying strategies to improve the efficacy of targeted biologic therapies together with non- invasive precision medicine guided-approaches.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY  Our understanding of the genetics of schizophrenia is advancing at a rapid pace and an increasing number of  risk associated  polymorphisms  and  variants  have  been  discovered.  Because  the  majority  of  these  variants  reside  in  intergenic,  intronic  and  other  non coding  sequences,  a  precise  variant  or  target  gene  for  schizophrenia  has  not  been  identified.  Therefore,  a  major  challenge  lies  in  designing  testable  hypotheses  to  elucidate the potential function of disease associated non coding DNA. Many of the risk variants are thought to  affect  gene  expression  through  alterations  of  regulatory  elements,  including  long range  enhancer  sequences  physically interacting with transcription start sites separated along the linear genome of DNA. The aim of this  proposal is to map the regulatory sequences (or open chromatin) in discrete cellular populations (neurons and  glia) derived from two human cortical brain regions in a large cohort of cases with schizophrenia and controls,  followed  by  generation  of  a  high resolution  quantitative  trait  loci  (QTL)  map  of  regulatory  sequences.  In  addition,  high  resolution  expression  quantitative  trait  loci  (eQTLs),  mapped  in  the  same  samples  and  brain  regions,  will  be  leveraged  to  identify  schizophrenia  associated  non coding  regions  that  are  simultaneously  associated  with  differential  exposure  of  regulatory  regions  (open  chromatin)  and  gene  expression  of  nearby  genes (eQTLs). Long range enhancer promoter interactions of genes potentially regulated by open chromatin  sequences will be mapped in human postmortem brain tissue using chromosome conformation capture. Using  the  existing  schizophrenia related  large scale  molecular  data  and  the  high impact,  high resolution,  complementary datasets generated through the proposed studies, we will develop multiscale network models  causally  linked  to  schizophrenia.  The  action  of  individual  genes  on  molecular  and  cellular  schizophrenia  associated  processes  and  the  molecular  networks  identified  in  our  studies  will  be  validated  using  iPS cell  derived  cultures  of  human  neuronal  cell  systems.  The  multidimensional  approach  presented  here  provides  a  roadmap  to  place  schizophrenia  genetic  risk  variants  in  molecular  contexts  to  help  identify  the  underlying  regulatory and expression mechanisms through which they act.

       " 'Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are common and often disabling conditions affecting many veterans of Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Enduring Freedom (OEF), and New Dawn (OND). Emerging evidence suggests that both conditions are associated with elevated levels of central and peripheral oxidative stress (OXS) and inflammation (INF). For this proposal, we have assembled a unique team of investigators with expertise in molecular genetics and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to study these processes in relation to chronic PTSD and mTBI. The study will draw from a large and psychiatrically heterogeneous cohort of veterans of OIF/OEF/OND, now on average 10 years post-deployment, with genome-wide genotype data available from a previous assessment. We will acquire new MRS scans for analysis in combination with the genomic data to examine associations of PTSD and mTBI with neural and peripheral indices of OXS and INF and identify genomic sources of individual differences in these associations. More specifically, the primary aims are to (a) examine associations between current PTSD, history of mTBI, and MRS measures of OXS and INF, (b) interrogate genes in the OXS and INF pathways to identify genetic moderators of the associations between PTSD, mTBI and MRS parameters, and (c) examine associations between MRS measures of OXS and INF, other MRI indices of neural integrity, and peripheral markers of OXS and INF. The ultimate goal of this study is to identify neurobiological pathways that can be used in the future to guide the development of blood panels and/or neuroimaging protocols for clinical assessment, as well as molecular targets for pharmacologic intervention for veterans suffering from chronic PTSD and mTBI.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Long-term viral suppression with antiretroviral treatment (ART) is difficult to maintain over the course of an entire lifetime, and significant toxicities to ART may accumulate with time. Novel strategies that maintain HIV viral suppression while allowing time off 3-drug ART are needed, and proof-of-concept studies to demonstrate the feasibility of such a strategy ? and to study its impact on viral reservoir, immune responses, and clinical outcomes ? are of high priority. We propose an open-label Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the efficacy of the broadly neutralizing HIV-1 monoclonal antibody VRC01 to maintain viral suppression in the absence of ART among virally suppressed HIV-infected children who started standard ART within 96 hours of birth (or soon after intrapartum infection). All children will be recruited from the Early Infant Treatment (EIT) study (U01AI114235), and have been followed from birth with frequent assessments of their clinical, virologic and immunologic characteristics. Children who have received 96-240 weeks of ART and meet virologic entry criteria will be offered enrollment into the proposed study. The intervention will consist of ongoing ART plus infusions of VRC01 antibodies for a period of 6 weeks, followed by monthly maintenance administration of VRC01 treatment alone for up to 24 additional weeks. Children receiving VRC01 maintenance therapy will be monitored closely, with immediate re-initiation of ART following any VL > 400 copies/mL. All participants will resume ART at week 30. The study is designed to evaluate three possible benefits of VCR01 therapy in HIV-1- infected children: 1) we will characterize the duration of virologic control that can be maintained with VRC01 treatment following early ART, providing proof-of-concept that VRC01 may serve as a possible alternative to standard ART in children with low viral reservoirs; 2) we will investigate whether VRC01 therapy is associated with changes in the size and/or the cellular or clonal composition of residual viral reservoirs, which will be highly informative for developing strategies to limit viral persistence and to destabilize viral reservoir homeostasis in pediatric patients; and 3) we will evaluate whether treatment with VRC01 is associated with qualitative or quantitative changes in innate or adaptive antiviral immune responses, and if it facilitates the development of an antiviral immune profile that can enable spontaneous post-treatment viral control.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract The transfusion of platelets is a major component of the treatment of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplants, trauma patients, sepsis, and battlefield injuries. However, due to a complete reliance upon donors as the only current approved source of platelets, and the strict, short shelf-life and storage conditions of donor- derived platelets, current supplies are not sufficient to meet increased needs as the population ages and may not be readily available in remote locations. We propose to develop a process for manufacturing human platelets under strict FDA guidelines from non-donor sources so that they may be administered to patients in the clinic. Our initial development work will utilize umbilical cord blood as the initial stem cell source for platelet production with the goal of developing methods that can be translated to the use of induce pluripotent stem cells as a renewable cell source that does not require continual donations. We will screen the cells to isolate those most capable of producing the best and largest quantities of platelets while we develop methods that result in the efficient, cost-effective production of large supplies of platelets sufficient for transfusions, 3-5 x 1011. The production of platelets will include the development of a bioreactor system that meets FDA guidelines and requirements for safety, quality, identity, purity, and potency and is capable of producing at least one transfusable unit per disposable bioreactor while limiting the cost of the final product. To ensure the accurate production of a clinically- relevant platelet product, we will test the safety and function of the platelets in a validated animal model and subject our manufactured platelets to clinical platelet functional tests utilized for donor-derived platelet testing. Finally, we will examine the feasibility of different storage options for our manufactured platelet products as they will be slightly different in composition from donor-derived platelets and thereby may not require the storage restrictions set for donor- derived platelets. This could greatly advance both the ready supply and the ability to access platelets in remote locations. KIYATEC?s platelets will reduce morbidity and mortality in multiple patient populations who suffer from bleeding related to platelet quantity or quality defects, including patients with cancer, trauma, sepsis and battlefield injuries.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY  Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States, causing nearly 600,000 deaths each year. A critical aspect of cancer progression is evasion of the immune system. The B7 and CD28 families of ligands and receptors mediate essential costimulatory or coinhibitory pathways; pathways that promote or suppress the immune system, respectively. B7x (B7-H4, B7S1 or VTCN1) is a newly discovered member of the B7-family that inhibits T-cell proliferation and effector functions. It is frequently overexpressed in a wide variety of human cancers, and is generally correlated with advanced disease status and poorer clinical outcomes. Previously, we demonstrated in a mouse model that B7x promotes tumor metastasis and promotes immunosuppressive cell populations such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Further, we also showed that blockade of B7x reduces tumor metastasis, alters the tumor-infiltrating immune population to favor anti-tumor effector cells, and confers long-term immunity against tumor rechallenge. Thus, we propose two aims: (1) Elucidate the regulation and function of B7x and its role in tumor progression (2) Develop and characterize anti-B7x therapy and its effect on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. For our first aim, we will explore tumor-associated hypoxia as a mechanism for B7x expression. Further, we will characterize the effects B7x has on the survival and generation of MDSCs. Lastly, we will investigate the role of B7x in tumor development and progression in vivo by generating a mouse spontaneous cancer model. In our second aim, we will develop and characterize B7x-targeted therapy. First, we have generated several clones of human B7x-specific monoclonal antibodies, which we will test for efficacy with our experimental metastasis model in vivo. Next, in context of the long-term anti-tumor immunity conferred by anti-B7x therapy, we will investigate how B7x blockade alters memory T-cell populations. Lastly, we will test B7x blockade in combination with established checkpoint inhibitors and determine if combination therapy has synergistic effects. With these studies, we seek to gain a better understanding of the functional contribution of B7x to tumor progression, and establish it as a prime target for immunotherapy.',\n",
       " 'Bronner, M.E.  In the early embryo, the neural plate border region contributes to diverse cell fates, ranging from neural crest cells and ectodermal placode cells to neurons of the central nervous system. Despite extensive studies of the neural crest and ectodermal placodes at post-neurula stages, surprisingly little is known about how these populations become distinct from one another within the early neural plate border. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that many neural plate border cells are multipotent as evidenced by their concomitant expression of markers characteristic of several fates. We will test this hypothesis by: 1) conducting a detailed analysis of the emerging neural plate border region by multiplex protein and gene expression profiling coupled with cell lineage analysis and 2) examining how perturbation of transcription factor levels affects expression profiles and lineage allocations of individual neural plate border cells. The significance of this proposal is that it will be the first to test how and when ectodermal placode precursors are segregated from neural crest and neural precursors at the neural plate border. The following aims will be performed: Aim 1: High resolution analysis of protein expression of neural plate, neural crest, placode and other  ectodermal markers in the neural plate border as a function of time. We will examine co-expression of  transcription factors associated with neural crest, placode, neural plate and ectodermal lineages  quantitatively and at single cell resolution in chick gastrula to neurula stages to determine their degree of  overlap and if/when a discrete separation occurs between them in the neural plate border. To take this to a  multiplex level, we will then perform single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis (smFISH) at  similar stages with 35 or more probes selected from known genes and new candidates from our single cell  RNA-seq dataset. Aim 2: Molecular dissection of regulatory interactions that mediate gene expression and cell fate  choice at the neural plate border. We will examine the consequence of perturbing individual transcription  factors (e.g. Pax7, Sox2, Six1) on expression of others neural plate border genes at the population and  single cell level. To examine inputs that regulate neural plate border formation, we will dissect novel  enhancers for Pax7, Six1 and other genes to determine direct regulatory inputs. Finally, we will examine  how balancing levels of transcription factors may influence other factors in the neural plate border region. Aim 3: Single cell lineage analysis of cells at the neural plate border. To definitively test whether  individual cells at the neural plate border have restricted or broad developmental potential, we will carry out  single cell lineage analysis by performing iontophoretic injection of lysinated rhodamine dextran into  individual neural plate border cells. We also will use enhancers for Pax7, Sox2, or Six1 as well as  photoconversion of individual cells to follow the long term fate of neural plate border cells and examine how  blocking individual transcription factors affects cell lineage allocation. 1',\n",
       " \"Project Summary/Abstract  Parallel processing is a common motif in neural sensory systems. In the mammalian olfactory bulb (MOB), odor information from the glomeruli is transmitted by the tufted and mitral cells (TCs and MCs) to different regions of the olfactory cortex, resulting in two parallel odor-processing pathways. The nature and functional significance of information processing performed by each pathway is not understood. Intrinsic cellular and network connectivity differences have been found between the two pathways, and stereotypical MOB gamma oscillation activity (gamma fingerprints) in local field potential recordings have been hypothesized to result from these differences. However, no explanation has been proposed that would mechanistically link the cellular and connectivity differences to the gamma fingerprints.  To make progress in understanding the nature of processing by these pathways, we propose a computational modeling approach that will build a rigorously validated, biophysically detailed network model of the MOB containing the TC and MC pathways. The model will be used to systematically manipulate the cellular and connectivity differences to establish their role in the formation of gamma fingerprints. Furthermore, the model will be used to investigate the differences in information processing by the TC and MC sub-systems, by simulating principal cell output and characterizing their differences. The model and the results of the manipulations will result in a mechanistic understanding of information processing by the TC/MC pathways.  In the first Specific Aim, published models of MOB cells will be validated against experimental data using the NeuronUnit framework developed in our lab for validating computational models, and models that best approximate experimental observations will be identified and extended. Membrane ion channel conductances and morphologies of TC and MC models then will be systematically manipulated to investigate their contributions to cell behaviors that support the formation of gamma fingerprints. In the second Specific Aim, validated cell models will be used to assemble a network model of the MOB. Lateral connectivity, synaptic properties, and inhibitory interneuron proportions will be systematically manipulated to investigate their contributions to the gamma fingerprints.  Under the mentorship of a computational neuroscientist Sponsor and with guidance from a Collaborator with expertise in olfaction research, the proposed project will form the basis of the Principal Investigator's graduate dissertation research. All models will be implemented in NEURON, shared using the modular, simulator-independent language NeuroML, which facilitates discovery, sharing, and reuse of models and their components by other researchers, and will be made available via online model sharing repositories.\",\n",
       " 'The goals of this K24 proposal are to train physician scientists in the conduct of patient -oriented research in Haiti and in Tanzania and to conduct a new study on urine metabolites for tuberculosis diagnosis in HIV- infected adults in Haiti (Aim 1).

       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability among veterans, and Department of Veterans Affairs health care users are the most severely affected.  There is ample evidence that exercise improves pain, function, and other outcomes among patients with knee OA.  However, the vast majority of individuals with knee OA are physically inactive.  There is clearly a need to develop and implement programs that efficiently and effectively foster regular physical activity and improve key patient-centered outcomes among veterans with knee OA.  The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness a novel STepped Exercise Program for Knee OsteoArthritis (STEP-KOA).  This will be a randomized controlled trial of n=345 veterans with symptomatic knee OA in two VISN 6 sites, with participants assigned to two study arms: STEP-KOA and Arthritis Education Control (AE).  STEP- KOA will begin with three months of access to a low-resource internet-based exercise training program that uses patient-specific information to determine and deliver an appropriate personalized exercise plan (Step 1).  Participants who do not meet response criteria for clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function after three months of Step 1 will additionally receive telephone calls from an  exercise counselor for three months, to facilitate adherence and address barriers to physical activity (Step 2).  Participants who still fail to meet response criteria after Step 2 will receivein-person physical therapy visits, which address specific functional impairments and further tailor exercise recommendations (Step 3).  Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months (primary outcome time point).  Veterans in the AE group will be offered participation in STEP-KOA after completing study assessments.  The primary outcome will be the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), a measure of lower extremity pain, stiffness and function.  The secondary outcomes will be objective measures of physical function.  The main study analyses will compare the STEP-KOA intervention to the AE control condition at follow-up time points.  We will also evaluate patient characteristics associated with the need for progression to each Step and will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of STEP-KOA.  This stepped exercise intervention is matched with patient needs, and it also provides the VA with a potential approach for focusing limited physical therapy resources toward patients who do not respond adequately to initial, less resource intensive and costly strategies to improve physical activity and related outcomes.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Every year there are an estimated 7.9 million children born with a serious birth defect and 3.3 million of these are children under five years of age who die from factors related to their birth defect. Comprehensive, reliable data on birth defects are not available for most developing countries. In many resource-poor settings, the baseline prevalence of birth defects is not known and systematic monitoring for birth defects is difficult or non- existent. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) in pregnancy can maximally reduce the risk of vertical transmission of HIV, and therefore it is recommended that all pregnant women with HIV receive effective ART regimens to prevent the transmission of HIV to their infants. However, there have been concerns about the possibility of women on ART at conception or during the first trimester having an increased risk of delivering an infant with a birth defect. The goal of this proposal is to establish a birth defect hospital based surveillance program in Kampala, Uganda and to determine the prevalence of major external birth defects and association of maternal risk factors including antiretroviral therapy to these defects. Four hospitals in Kampala, Uganda will be included in the surveillance system with approximately 48,000 deliveries per year. Informative births (live and stillborn) regardless of gestational age that are born at the four hospitals will be included in the surveillance project for a duration of five years. Informative births are those in which the newborn is formed well enough to ascertain whether or not there is a birth defect. Each newborn will be examined as soon as possible after birth. Infant measurements (weight, head circumference and length) will be obtained and all newborns will be examined for major external birth defects by trained midwives. Newborns with major external birth defects will be photographed after obtaining consent and the photographs will be used to classify the diagnosis. As needed, the photos and verbatim descriptions will be sent to birth defect experts for confirmation of diagnoses and for coding of the birth defect using ICD-10 disease classification criteria. Demographic information, HIV status and obstetric information (parity status, previous live and still births, presence of physical defects of births of previous children) will be collected for all mothers. Every mother of an infant identified with a major external birth defect of interest will be asked to participate in a case-control study. Three controls will be selected for each case matched on hospital of delivery. After consenting, each mother will be asked to respond to questions regarding, types of medications taken during pregnancy including antiretroviral drugs and cotrimoxazole, medical history and more detailed demographic information. The surveillance program will provide crucial current data on the baseline prevalence of birth defects in Uganda while the case-control study will allow examination of the possible effects of antiretroviral treatment on infant outcomes while also screening for other common known causes of birth defects.',\n",
       " 'Background: Given significant concerns about risks and benefits, the VA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have each embarked on initiatives to reduce off-label use of antipsychotic medications (APs) for the nearly universal and burdensome behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). The percent of residents on APs in nursing homes (NH; in the VA, Community Living Centers or CLCs) is used by policymakers as the main quality indicator for BPSD. In addition to NH/CLCs, policymakers are also concerned with high rates of AP use in community settings. Using VA data from 1999- 2007, we previously found that AP use reductions following the 2005 FDA black box warning (regarding increased mortality for APs in dementia) were simply offset by increases in use of other classes of psychotropic medications, with no overall decrease in psychotropic use. Thus, policies focused entirely on reducing AP use may have caused ?unintended consequences,? such as providers shifting patients to alternative psychotropic classes with even less evidence of benefit and similar risks, including benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants. Rather than substituting other psychotropics, multiple expert bodies recommend the use of behavioral and environmental interventions as the preferred alternative to APs for BPSD. The VA has widely implemented a program to increase uptake of such interventions within CLC settings called STAR-VA. However, STAR-VA has to date been implemented in a minority of CLCs, does not target prescribing, and its sustained impact is unknown.  In partnership with the VA Office of Mental Health Operations, Mental Health Services, the Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative, STAR-VA, Geriatrics and Extended Care, and Pharmacy Benefits Management, this study will examine the system- and facility-level consequences of VA and non-VA initiatives related to dementia intended to reduce AP prescribing. Objectives: Aim 1: To determine system-level VA national trends (in both CLC and community settings) in psychotropic use among patients with dementia since the first black-box warning (2005) to 2014; Aim 2: To examine CLC-level variables that may be associated with AP prescribing in dementia (FY2014); and Aim 3: To validate additional quality indicators for VA patients with dementia for both CLC and community settings. Methods: In Aim 1, using interrupted time-series analyses, VA national health system administrative data (FY 2005-2014) will be used to examine the impact of initiatives to reduce antipsychotic use in dementia, with a focus on substitution patterns of other psychotropics for antipsychotics. We will also assess variation found in post-warning changes in AP and other psychotropic use in Veterans with dementia by variables including: race/ethnicity; academic affiliation; and geographic location. In Aim 2, CLC facilities classified into quintiles by mean facility-level AP prescribing (in FY 2013) will be compared on variables (derived from FY2014 data) that may reflect both unintended and desired consequences in quality of care for residents with BPSD, including: 1) other psychotropic use, physical restraint use, and health care utilization; 2) BPSD level prior to AP prescription; and 3) an available measure potentially reflecting quality of CLC care and non-pharmacologic strategy use (the Artifacts of Cultural Change or ACCT) and implementation of STAR-VA (yes/no). Informed by the findings from Aims 1 and 2 regarding factors that are associated with quality of care for veterans with dementia, in Aim 3, we will use a two-round modified Delphi panel of experts and stakeholders in dementia care and BPSD to validate additional, clinically-relevant quality indicators.',\n",

       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iron is an essential element but is toxic in excess. The concentration of free iron within cells is determined by regulated transmembrane iron import and storage. Malregulation of iron transport results in tissue injury, either from iron deprivation or overload. We propose to identify and characterize genes and proteins that affect the storage of iron in the yeast vacuole and in mammalian lysosomes and determine the mechanisms of high iron toxicity. We will continue our approach of using yeast genetics to identify genes involved in iron metabolism. We have shown that high iron induces a response that up-regulates the expression of the vacuole iron importer Ccc1, which protects yeast cells from iron toxicity. This transcriptional response is regulated by the iron sensitive transcription factor Yap5. We have discovered that transcription of CCC1 is increased by low glucose and iron in a Yap5-independent manner. We will identify the molecules responsible for the Yap5-independent induction of CCC1 and how low glucose affects iron storage. Yeast and mammals also export iron from the vacuole and lysosomes during iron limitation. We will determine if the yeast vacuolar iron exporters, Fet5/Fth1 and Smf3, are regulated post-translationally. Using stringent genetic selection systems, we will identify structural features on transporters that define metal specificity. Vertebrates store iron in ferritin and stored iron can be released from ferritin. Ferrtin can be degraded in the cytosol or in lysosomes, which are the equivalent of yeast vacuoles. We will determine how iron is exported from lysosomes. Iron is stored in ferritin as Fe3+ and must be reduced to Fe2+ to be exported by transporters. We will identify the mechanism of iron reduction and if there is a pool of lysosomal Fe2+. We will determine the role of putative lysosomal iron exporters and if those exporters are regulated at the level of localization, protein stability or activity. Our studies in yeast suggest that iron toxicity can occur both in the presene and absence of oxygen. We will determine the mechanism of oxygen independent iron toxicity. We identified two unique metabolites whose levels increase under conditions of iron toxicity. Through the use of metabolic profiling, we identified two unique metabolites that are only generated by toxic concentrations of iron. We will test the hypothesis that these metabolites are generated by an enzyme that is either mismetallated or altered by high iron. We will also determine if iron-dependent alteration of mitochondrial DNA is a prerequisite for oxygen-dependent iron toxicity. We have shown that alteration of citrate levels exacerbates iron toxicity in yeast. We will determine if alteration of citrate levels affects mammalian iron toxicity.',\n",

Since 1998, 89 UR students have earned PhDs, 12 of them MD/PhDs and 3 MDs after medical school. Currently, 87 of them are employed in science, with two others returning soon. Fifteen alumni have faculty positions at Tier 1 institutions (43% who have finished post-docs or residencies). They have acquired a few grants already, including a K99/00, an Early Independence, a R01, a Robert Wood Johnson, and 5 grants from other sources. Ten Ph.D. students are supported each year (salaries and fringe). UR graduate student education has been enhanced by creating individual development plans for each under-represented Ph.D. student with opportunities for a summer bridge program that sponsors a review of molecular and cellular biology, and a mini-review of genetics and neuroscience. Students have increased time to complete graduate coursework with tutoring support, faculty mentoring, fellowship application training, skills building workshops, including four tiers of writing workshops and scientific conference participation. Activities of the Association for Graduate Student Diversity have been enhanced; a seminar series features local and external minority scientists. The number of UR Ph.D. and MD/Ph.D. students enrolled at Baylor College of Medicine at any one time increased from 20 in 1998 to 38 in August of 2001 to 80 by August of 2007.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common polymorphisms at the CXCL12 locus significantly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). We have reproduced the association of this locus with CHD risk in multiethnic studies and have identified a novel variant that increases CHD risk, decreases plasma CXCL12 levels and alters expression of CXCL12 gene. We further hypothesized that if CXCL12 is causally involved in the pathogenesis of CHD than genetic variation at its primary receptor CXCR4 may also be associated with CHD. To test our hypothesis, we investigated genetic variation at the CXCR4 locus through meta-analyses of genetic data on common variants involving ~63,000 CHD cases and ~92,000 controls and fine-mapping experiments in ~50,000 CHD cases and ~50,000 controls. First, we were able to identify a common variant at the CXCR4 locus that is strongly associated with CHD risk (P = 4x10-7). Second, preliminary analyses of fine-mapping studies identified: (i) a low frequency variant in the promoter region of CXCR4 that associates with CHD risk at experiment-wide significance levels (OR: 1.13; P-value: 7.1x10-6) and (ii) a naturally occurring rare missense variant in the CXCR4 gene (I57L; OR: 2.16 P = 6x10-3) associated with increased CHD risk. The same analyses also identified a low-frequency missense variant in the CXCL12 gene (R125C; OR: 3.38; P = 0.01) nominally associated with increased CHD risk. Through mechanistic studies, we were able to further demonstrate that endothelial specific deficiency of CXCR4 leads to accelerated atherosclerosis in mice. Capitalizing on these findings, we plan to conduct genetic, biomarker, and mechanistic studies to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms and the directional impact of the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway on disease risk. Such evidence will help prioritize or deprioritize existing therapeutic programs that are already considering CXCL12 as a potential therapeutic target in CHD. In particular, we will reinforce our ongoing fine-mapping experiments by integrating (i) whole-exome sequencing studies in 10,000 early-onset MI cases (men and women aged ? 50 years) and 10,000 controls. We will further conduct (ii) measurements for circulating plasma CXCL12 levels in 12,000 participants (including 5,500 with incident CHD events and 3,000 participants in a high risk CHD group) enrolled in three prospective studies and three clinical trials. We will integrate evidence on plasma CXCL12 levels, genes and CHD risk to help assess directionality and utility of plasma CXCL12 as a marker of causality. We will mechanistically evaluate at the CXCL12 locus the lead coding and non- coding variants associated with CHD risk in human and murine cells and on mouse atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. We will also mechanistically evaluate CXCR4 genetic variation in human iPS cell derived macrophages and endothelial cells. We will obtain genotype specific human iPS cells through two complimentary approaches: (i) recall of participants based on genotype and (ii) targeted genome editing through TALENs. We will further conduct studies to investigate CXCR4 expression and protein function by genotype through specific quantitative and functional assays. Findings from the proposed study should have considerable translational implications. The two joint-PIs provide internationally recognized cross-disciplinary expertise in vascular biomarkers, epidemiology, experimental biology, and clinical medicine, a combination of skills that will help translate findings for clinical benefit.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY ? CORE C Core C, which supports every project within the Program, provides access to sophisticated imaging technologies and histopathology services, enabling Program investigators to use imaging to obtain insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms and to track tumor progression, therapy response, and metastasis. Imaging in cells and animals ? from the molecular, to tissue, to whole-body level ? is supported by the Core. Core C will assist with sub-cellular to whole-tissue level analysis of fixed cells and tissues, providing histopathological services through a subcontract with a world-class pathologist. The Core also supports live cell imaging in three and four dimensions (3D and 4D, also known as 3D time-lapse), and imaging in live animals. The imaging approaches offered by Core C include several cutting-edge imaging technologies, each of which is available in a limited number of locations worldwide. These include i) super-resolution (100 nm), and high-speed cellular imaging achieved with an OMX (Optical Microscope eXperimental) microscope; ii) 3D whole-tissue reconstruction of tumors and metastases using light-sheet microscopy; and iii) intravital (live animal) imaging using custom-built spinning disk confocal and multi-photon microscopes. During the upcoming period of requested support, Core C proposes to support Program investigators through four aims. First, the program will provide assistance with histology, immune labeling, and histopathology. Second, the Core will support live cell imaging and super-resolution imaging. Third, the Core will assist with imaging at the tissue level, either using 3D tissue reconstruction or live imaging in animals. These technologies each require custom-built microscopes that are not generally available. Fourth, to provide Program investigators with tools to track tumor growth and metastasis, Core C will assist with whole animal imaging approaches, including bioluminescence, fluorescent proteins, and small animal ultrasound. Core C will also assist with the use of advanced imaging software, including Image J (NIH), Imaris (Bitplane), and Volocity (Perkin-Elmer). New in this renewal is support for quantification of micrometastasis, intravital imaging through surgically implanted windows, and 3D tissue reconstruction using light-sheet microscopy. Together, Core C has an unprecedented imaging platform, covering super-resolution imaging, 3D tissue reconstruction, live cell tracking in tissues and whole animal imaging. A Core that enables program investigators access to these technologies is essential as most of the imaging technologies supported by the Core are highly sophisticated and require very specialized training. Furthermore, access to the instruments required for these imaging technologies would be cost-prohibitive without the support of a Core. Thus, Core C will provide critical tools for Program members and, through the development of new imaging approaches, ultimately the broader cancer research community.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Despite the hope that pharmacogenomics (PGx) will improve the risk-benefit ratio of certain medications, there is little empiric evidence about how PGx might impact patient outcomes such as drug safety and effectiveness. The research activities in this career development award will use simvastatin PGx as a model of the impact of genomic medicine on patient outcomes. Statins are cholesterol-lowering medications that have dramatically reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death in millions of Americans. Statins can also cause muscle injury (myopathy) ranging from mild muscle aches to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Recently, genome-wide association studies have identified a locus in the SLCO1B1 gene that is associated with the risk of statin-associated myopathy. Up to twenty percent of Americans carry at least one copy of the C allele at SLCO1B1 rs4149056, which increases the risk of myopathy greater than four-fold. PGx testing for the SLCO1B1 locus might improve the safety of statin use in patient care. However, at the same time, SLCO1B1 testing may result in insufficient statin dosing for a given patient's level of CVD risk. To examine the impact of statin PGx on patient outcomes, this project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of SLCO1B1 testing in a Veteran patient population. First, metrics will be developed for statin-related patient outcomes in the VA health system. VA provider notes will be used to develop and validate a natural language processing algorithm to identify statin myopathy from text from the electronic health record. VA clinical and administrative data will be used to develop informatics-based approaches to categorize Veterans into American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) CVD risk categorizes and determine whether their statin doses are appropriate for their level of CVD risk. These metrics will then be used as outcomes for a randomized controlled trial determining the impact of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 testing on statin safety and appropriate statin dosing among 408 VA primary care patients. Veterans at higher CVD risk will be randomized to undergo SLCO1B1 testing versus no testing in the course of usual primary care. After one year, the two groups will be compared regarding the occurrence of statin myopathy, cholesterol levels, and concordance with ACC/AHA guidelines for CVD prevention and PGx guidelines for simvastatin safety. In addition to gathering empiric evidence about the impact of statin PGx on Veteran health outcomes, this career development award includes mentorship, coursework, and seminars in translational genomics, PGx, and innovative randomized controlled trial design. The research and career development activities will prepare the applicant for his long-term goal of a research career in translational genomics that informs how genomic medicine might be used to improve Veteran health.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects ~15% of the U.S. population. Although a broad range of insults initiate kidney injury, fibrosis is a hallmark of all forms of progressive CKD. In spite of advances in delineating pathways that contribute to kidney fibrosis, there are no specific treatments for this serious disorder.  TGF-? signaling is a central mediator of fibrosis in multiple tissues making it an attractive therapeutic target. However, because these cytokines have a wide range of roles in human physiology and pathology, the challenge has been to find a therapeutic strategy that is selective for the diseased target tissue to improve efficacy and safety profiles. A promising approach is to disrupt TGF-? activation in the injured tissue. TGF-? is secreted as a latent, inactive complex that is sequestered in high concentrations in the extracellular matrix. A critical step in the regulation of TGF-? signaling is activation of the latent complex by binding of alpha v (?v) integrins to lysine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motifs. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will determine if a novel small molecule RGD peptidomimetic inhibitor of TGF-? activation will reduce kidney fibrosis in mouse models of nephrotoxicity, ischemia and urinary tract obstruction. Our preliminary studies indicated that this compound is safe and effective and thus a highly promising candidate for future translational studies in patients.  Developing effective treatments for kidney disease requires increased knowledge about molecular mechanisms that drive progressive fibrosis of the organ. Myofibroblasts, derived from peri-vascular mesenchymal progenitor cells are the principal source of extracellular matrix deposition in organ fibrosis. However, the cellular and molecular pathways that control the formation of these cells in response to injury are not well understood. In Aim 2, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which alpha v (?v) integrins regulate the proliferation and differentiation of myofibroblasts after injury.  These pre-clinical studies will advance knowledge about mechanisms of organ fibrosis and have the potential to identify a novel therapeutic strategy to treat chronic kidney disease in veterans.',\n",
       " 'Early in cancer growth, metastases and dendritic cells (DCs) traffic to draining lymph nodes (DLN). In lung cancer and other carcinomas, immune-suppression dominates a tumor microenvironment characterized by immature DCs, weak T-effector responses, proliferation of T-regulatory cells (Tregs), and over-production of immuno-suppressive cytokines. This heavily represses anti-tumor immunity. A high-impact area of new scientific discovery is immunotherapy. We find dramatic clinical responses in some advanced-stage cancer patients by blocking suppression of effector T cells. Only a fraction (<25%) of such patients, however, respond with durable remissions. Preliminary work shows that a unique class of glycans known as heparan sulfate (HS) drives subversive DC traffic and DC immaturity. While we have inhibited such DC traffic by targeting lymphatic endothelial HS, new work suggests that DC-specific HS alterations may modulate both pathologic chemokine- dependent DC traffic as well as DC maturation and function. New studies also show that these properties may favorably impact anti-tumor T cell functions, with inhibition of tumor growth and progression. Herein we target such glycans in tumor and cell-based studies, while studying immune-function and molecular mechanisms. This proposal addresses the hypothesis that targeting HS glycans on the surface of DCs in lung cancer through genetic means and novel inhibitors will inhibit DLN colonization by tolerogenic DCs and improve anti- tumor immunity. Reduced immune-tolerance and improved tumor-antigen responses by more mature DCs, with improved T cell induction will result in a novel endogenous anti-tumor state. To test this, we propose to: (1) Characterize tumor growth and anti-tumor immunity in model antigen- as well as spontaneous lung carcinoma models in mice bearing DC-glycan alterations. We will assess how a DC-targeted mutation in a key sulfating HS biosynthetic enzyme (Ndst1) affects T cell immunity in tumors and thoracic DLN of mice with orthotopic Ovalbumin-expressing Lewis lung carcinomas (LLC-Ova), including Ova-specific immunity and effects on tumor growth. Immunity and tumor growth in a KRAS transgenic mutant model will also be studied. (2) Study anti-tumor DC and T cell functions in ex-vivo preparations from lung carcinoma bearing mice with DC-specific alterations in HS biosynthesis. DC maturation, antigen presentation, and the capacity of DCs from LLC-Ova tumors grown in DC-targeted HS mutants to activate Ova-sensitized T cells will be examined, as will tumor-cytolytic capacity of CD8+ T cells isolated from DLNs of tumor-bearing mutant vs control mice. Studies will also include the effects of mutation on DLN colonization by plasmacytoid DCs and their functional capacity. (3) Assess chemokine-receptor interactions and signaling mechanisms in the setting of DC-targeted alterations in HS biosynthesis; and the effects of novel HS inhibitors on tumor growth and immunity. We will study how HS mutation affects DC-surface binding of lymphatic chemokines CCL21, CXCL12, or CX3CL1 to cognate receptors. The effect of HS mutation on DC migration and maturation signaling in response to chemokine will be assessed, including the activation of pDCs through novel TLR-dependent mechanisms. Finally, we will study how novel HS inhibitors affect signaling by tumor DCs as well as lung carcinoma growth and immunity. This work examines novel mechanisms whereby altering trafficking and maturation of tumor DCs may effectively re-program endogenous anti-tumor immunity. The genetic target validation and rational introduction of glycan-targeting inhibitors may guide new therapies to achieve immune eradication of human lung cancer.',\n",
       " \"Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a major threat to human health. Each year in the United States, approximately 2 million people are infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics resulting in at least 23,000 deaths. The development of novel antibiotics is needed. However, de novo antibiotic development is resource intensive. Given the poor return on investment, major pharmaceutical companies have significantly decreased antibiotic Research and Development efforts. Academic labs generally do not have access to compounds and sufficient data for rationale design. Veterans who undergo surgical procedures for trauma, including head trauma, are vulnerable to multiple surgical infection, sometimes with organisms that are unlikely to ever represent an attractive target for pharmaceutical companies.  Antibiotic development that capitalizes on existing drug designwork conducted by industry, may avoid some of the expensive missteps due to poor pharmacologic properties that can inadvertently arise in the lead selection. Our approach uses structure-based computational modeling to repurpose drugs as antibiotics. Previous work in our lab demonstrated that inhibition of a Listeria kinase, belonging to a family of Penicillin binding And Serine/Threonine kinase Associated (PASTA) proteins, can sensitize the bacteria to beta-lactam antibiotics. Bacterial Serine/Threonine kinases are signal transducers and our work suggests they are a novel drug development target. While PASTA kinases are common in some gram-positive bacteria, we found there is drug selectivity, not only between human and bacterial kinases, but also between bacterial kinases. We are targeting the subset of PASTA kinase containing bacteria with a large back pocket. We have already obtained a crystal structure of our target bacterial kinase (PknB) with a lead compound demonstrating this pocket. This information enables us to specifically modify the lead to both increase potency and maximize selectivity using previously defined structure activity relationships with human kinases. Furthermore, our atomic resolution drug: target structure will guide us on regions of the drug that can be modified to explicitly test Lipinski's rules for drug development and determine if they should be modified for antibiotic drug development. In this proposal, we will build on our existing work with the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1: Design, synthesize, and test both biochemically and microbiologically novel aminofurazan kinase inhibitors that exploit the uniquely shaped back pocket of some of the PknB family of kinases. Aim 2: Test the toxicity of these novel kinase inhibitors, as well as determine the effectiveness of  combined beta lactam antibiotics with kinase inhibition in an animal model (Danio rerio). We will  analyze the effect of our kinase inhibitors on both a panel of human kinases as well as on  embryogenesis and fertility in zebrafish. When this work is complete, we will have generated data on how to design kinase inhibitors that act poorly against human and zebrafish kinases, but are potent against certain bacterial kinases. Pathogens that include kinases with this unique back pocket morphology include diverse skin and soil bacteria that complicate traumatic and surgical infections in the VA such as Clostridia, Nocardia, Propionibacterium acnes, and Mycobacterium. Furthermore, our work will set the stage for early stage trials on treating drug resistant mycobacterial and nocardial infections as well as atypical skin organisms that can complicate surgical infections common in veterans using a novel agent that synergizes with an existing antibiotic class with low toxicity.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an evidence-based, cost-effective, and widely-available multidisciplinary program that combines supervised exercise with psychoeducation on health behavior change aimed at improving overall health and reducing cardiovascular risk in individuals with established CVD. Despite CR's ample attention to increasing physical activity (PA) and improving diet it produces almost no weight loss (WL). WL would significantly improve the CR patients' health, the majority of who present to CR with obesity. Gold standard in-person behavioral weight loss interventions (BWLs) produce clinically significant WL that improves health and disease risk/severity, but these programs are so burdensome and costly that they are impossible to conduct within existing CR programs. The primary mentor's fully automated 3-month online program, Rx Weight Loss (RxWL), produced clinically significant meanÂ±SD WL of 5.8Â±4.4 % of initial body weight in physician-referred patients (N=154), 5.8 Â±5.2 % in worksites (N=75), and 4.2Â±5.3 % in community settings (N=230); this was maintained at 6-months. Dr. Goldstein, the candidate, aims to conduct formative work to tailor RxWL for use in CR. She will then use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to rapidly screen 4 innovative eHealth/mHealth intervention components with the potential to improve WL in this special population when combined with the core RxWL program. Following pilot testing with n=20, a fully-powered 24 full factorial experiment with 160 patients (each randomized to receive 0-4 of the components) will be used to test the 4 novel intervention components: (a) a tailored interactive intervention to promote structured PA using a Fitbit; (b) a bite counting device to promote caloric restriction; (c) a Web-based virtual reality (VR) intervention for BWL skills implementation; and (d) virtual meetings to increase WL self-efficacy. By the 6-month follow-up, this design will allow the candidate to determine which components maximize WL and whether there are favorable component combinations. Dr. Goldstein will test which components are (or are not) effective and why or how they exert their effects, which is critical for understanding their mechanism of action (or inaction). Each component will be required to meet a 2% WL optimization criterion for inclusion in the final treatment package. This research will result in a fully- automated BWL treatment package optimized for CR, which will be submitted for testing in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in an R01 developed during the K23 grant period. Given the candidate's success while earning her PhD from Kent State University and completing an NHLBI-funded Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine T32 at The Miriam Hospital and Brown University, the candidate will undoubtedly leverage the resources in her exemplary research environment to develop into a successful, independent scientist. Through a robust training plan and innovative research project, Dr. Goldstein will become one of the only independent scientists to use eHealth/mHealth technology to facilitate WL in CVD, specifically CR, patients.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary. Obesity represents a state of chronic, low-grade tissue inflammation that contributes to insulin resistance (IR) steatosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The demands for effective therapy call for improved understanding of the disease. There is a significant gap in our understanding of the endogenous factors that regulate both inflammatory responses and insulin sensitivity. In this application, we showed that a peptide, catestatin (CST), derived from a gene product, chromogranin A (CgA), directly improves lipid disposal and inflammation leading to reversal of insulin resistance (IR) in a mouse model of obesity. CST improved IR in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice without weight loss. We generated CST-deficient knockout (CST-KO) mice, which are obese and insulin resistant in normal chow diet. As a possible mechanism, our data suggested that CST raised AMP levels by inhibiting AMP-deaminase (AMPD), stimulated AMP-dependent Kinase (AMPK) signaling and AKT phosphorylation in DIO liver as well as in hepatocyte cultures, signifying a direct CST effect. This activation of AMPK and AKT signaling by CST suppresses gluconeogenesis via phosphorylation of CRTC2 and FoxO1 and elevates glycogen production via activation of phosphoglucomutase (PGM). Another consequence of CST action is to attenuate inflammation, mediated by macrophages, in an AMPK-dependent manner. This is accomplished by suppressing cytokine production and proinflammatory signaling, which in turn, could enhance AKT signaling. Analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the sections of liver and adipose tissue of DIO mice after CST treatment indicated diminished infiltration or recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages. We hypothesize that CST inhibits activity of AMPD2 giving rise to elevated level of AMP, and activation of AMPK, which in turn, reduces steatosis and macrophage-mediated inflammation leading to enhancement of insulin signaling and suppression of gluconeogenesis in DIO and CST-KO mice. We will verify our hypothesis by working with two specific aims: Aim I. To test whether CST suppresses hepatic glucose production through activation of AMPK via inhibition of AMP-deaminase 2 (AMPD2) which elevates AMP levels necessary for AMPK activation. In this aim, we will examine the mechanism of CST action in liver and hepatocyte focusing on AMPK and PGM activation. Aim II. To test the hypothesis that CST-mediated activation of AMPK leads to suppression of inflammation and glucose production via enhancement of AKT signaling in DIO and CST-KO mice. In this aim, we will analyze the pathways invoked by CST-mediated AMPK activation that lead to suppression of inflammation and glucose production. We will execute these specific aims by knocking down activities of AMPD2 and AMPK? and analyzing their impacts on CST mediated signaling, AMP/ATP ratio, PGM activity, cytokine and glucose production. Through investigation with this proposal, we believe we will discover a novel pathway for regulation of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     1) Background: Schizophrenia is a devastating illness that costs the US over $60 billion per year, mainly due to unemployment, lost productivity, and other consequences of poor functioning. Vocational rehabilitation programs such as Supported Employment (SE) improve psychosocial functioning. However, less than 1/4 of the patients at our facility with a schizophrenia-related diagnosis participate in SE despite its availability. We have developed a new integrated Cognitive Behavior Therapy (iCBT) group therapy protocol designed for low functioning patients with schizophrenia to improve motivation and engagement in psychosocial rehabilitation programs like SE.  2) Objectives: The objective of the current proposal is to evaluate whether iCBT can improve engagement and success in an existing SE program among the most functionally disabled patients with schizophrenia. Our primary specific aim is to determine whether iCBT + SE will significantly improve work outcomes at post- treatment to a greater extent than Psychoeducation (PE) + SE in low functioning patients with schizophrenia.  Our secondary aims are to evaluate the whether iCBT + SE will significantly improve work outcomes at 6  month follow-up relative to PE + SE, and whether iCBT + SE will improve functional outcomes post-treatment  and at follow-up relative to PE + SE.  3) Research Design: We are proposing a prospective randomized controlled trial with participants recruited from the Philadelphia VA Medical Center (PVAMC). We will randomize 96 patients (48 patients per condition).  Assessors will be blinded to participant treatment group allocation. Assessment sessions will occur at baseline, and at 6, 12, and 18 months.  4) Methodology: The study inclusion criteria are as follows: 1) Diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective  disorder, 2) Severe functional disability, 3) At least 90 days since last hospitalization, 4) Receiving treatmen at  PVAMC, 5) Minimal engagement in psychiatric rehabilitation services, 6) Ages 18-65, 7) Proficient in English,  8) Able to give informed consent. Exclusion criteria are: 1) Neurologic disease or damage that would make the diagnosis of schizophrenia questionable, 2) Current opioid or stimulant dependence. Patients in the iCBT condition will receive weekly or twice weekly group sessions for 12 months. iCBT follows a treatment manual  developed by Perivoliotis, Grant, & Beck. The manual details the approach (engagement, behavioral activation, cognitive remediation/restructuring, maintenance) and individualized treatment planning. It also describes strategies and techniques to deal with positive and negative symptoms, mood symptoms, and suicidality. It incorporates cognitive remediation strategies.33 Patients assigned to PE will receive weekly or twice weekly group sessions for 12 months. PE follows an evidence-based model already being delivered at the PVAMC.  Patients in both conditions will participate in the existing SE program at PVAMC. All participants will continue to receive any services (medical, psychiatric, case management) they were already receiving. The primary outcome measure will be the total score on the Work Behavior Inventory (WBI) at the end of treatment.  Secondary outcomes measures will be total score of the WBI at follow up and the total score on the Specific Levels of Functioning inventory (SLOF) measured at post-treatment and 6 month follow-up.',\n",
       " 'Summary/Abstract An important cause of preterm labor is immune infiltration into the placenta. Although the placental immune response likely starts long before delivery, no technique currently available permits in vivo, real-time assessment of placental immune responses during pregnancy. As a result, clinicians have limited ability to detect placental inflammation or intervene so as to reduce the immune response and prevent preterm delivery. This R01 application proposes to develop a novel, noninvasive human placental immune imaging (PII) technique, which will be able to safely assess human placental inflammation in real time, responding to RFA-HD-18-003: Moving Beyond Standard Assessments: Applying Novel Tools to Assess Human Placental Structure and Function in Real Time. PII will be based on a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique called diffusion basis spectrum imaging, which can noninvasively image and quantify brain inflammation in multiple sclerosis in both animal models and human patients. Development of PII must take into account the fact that the human placenta is quite different from animal placentas and is a very dynamically changing organ throughout pregnancy. The anatomic and potential pathological complexity and heterogeneity of the placenta create strong background noise interference not present in the brain, making it more challenging to identify and extract the signals specific to placental inflammation. To address this technical challenge, this proposal will develop PII specifically for human applications by making use of three distinct clinical cohorts: those at low risk of preterm birth (Aim 1), and those at high risk of preterm birth who either respond or fail to respond to treatment to prevent preterm birth (Aims 2 and 3). In addition to performing PII on these women at two (Aims 2 and 3) or three (Aim 1) time points in pregnancy, this proposal includes measurement of immune factors and long non-coding RNAs in maternal blood, and histological characterization of inflammatory cells in placenta samples obtained at delivery. Completion of these aims will 1) yield a fully developed PII system, 2) refine PII through histopathological assessments of placentas and measures of systemic immune responses, 3) define the placental immune responses characteristic of healthy, term pregnancy, 4) identify placental immune responses characteristic of pregnancies at risk of preterm birth, and 5) begin to reveal immune signatures associated with success and failure of progesterone treatment. Because PII will require MRI sequences that are already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, its safety and great accessibility will allow it to be rapidly extended to clinical trials or clinical populations.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source ? the true gold standard for PET AC ? will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY     ALT  (Alternative  Lengthening  of  Telomeres)  cancers  encompass  a  significant  fraction  (15%)  of  human  cancers.  These  immortalized  cells  maintain  their  telomeres  using  homology directed  recombination.  The  observation  that  ALT  is  activated  in  a  significant  fraction  of  tumors,  coupled  with  its  potential  as  an  adaptive  mechanism  to  anti telomerase  tumor  therapies,  make  it  an  important  target  for  anti cancer  strategies.  Yet,  targeted therapeutics for ALT cancers have not been greatly explored. Recent studies showed that a hallmark  of  ALT  cells  is  loss  of  the  chromatin  remodeler  ATRX,  but  how  its  loss  contributes  to  telomere  recombination  had  not  been  elucidated.  We  found  that  loss  of  ATRX  suppresses  resolution  of  sister  chromatid  cohesion  at  telomeres  to  promote  sister  telomere  recombination  and  prevent  deleterious  non allelic  recombination.  Sister  telomere  cohesion  is  normally  resolved  in  G2/prophase  of  the  cell  cycle  by  the  poly ADP  ribose  polymerase  tankyrase 1 that localizes to telomeres through the shelterin subunit TRF1. We found that due to loss of ATRX  the ?normal? system of telomere resolution is defective in ALT cells and telomeres remain cohered into mitosis.  In the absence of ATRX its binding partner (the histone variant macroH2A1.1) is free to sequester tankyrase 1,  preventing it from resolving telomere cohesion. Persistent telomere cohesion has an essential role, as forced  resolution of telomere cohesion by ATRX introduction or tankyrase 1 overexpression in ALT cells leads to loss  of recombination between sister telomeres, increased non sister copying, and cell death. We hypothesize that  persistent telomere cohesion assists in telomere maintenance by promoting sister telomere recombination and  in  safeguarding  genome  integrity  by  preventing  aberrant  and  toxic  non sister  recombination.  In  Aim  1  of  this  proposal,  I  will  elucidate  the  mechanisms  of  persistent  telomere  cohesion  and  in  Aim  2,  I  will  define  the  proteome  of  the  cohered  state  in  ALT  cells.  My  studies  will  provide  mechanistic  insights  into  telomere  recombination and identify potential targets for ALT cancer therapy.             ',\n",
       " 'Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), as a classic approach for cancer immunotherapy, can cure a variety of hematopoietic malignances such as leukemia, termed as the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains the primary case of transplant-related morbidity and mortality, thereby limiting the use of allo-HCT. GVHD develops in two forms: acute and chronic with distinct etiology, pathophysiology, and response to therapeutic regimens. aGVHD is primarily induced by T cells commonly characterized by a type I T-cell response; whereas cGVHD is induced by both T and B cells similar in nature to autoimmune disorders. Despite advances in patient care and pharmacologic prophylaxis strategies, the incidence of GVHD particular cGVHD has not been substantially reduced over the years. Because effective treatment options are very limited beyond steroids, it is urgently required to further understand cGVHD pathogenesis and identify novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of the devastating disease as a major complication of allo-HCT. Sphingolipids are involved in signaling pathways that mediate cell growth, differentiation, cell death and multiple cell functions. Ceramide is considered at the central hub of sphingolipid metabolism and can be synthesized by de novo mechanism that involves 6 key enzyme ceramide synthases (CerSs). The importance of lipid rafts and ceramide platforms in modulating immune responses of T and B cells has been elucidated. Our preliminary data shows that T cells deficient for CerS6 impaired TCR-signaling, activation, and pathogenecity in the induction of aGVHD. We hypothesize that ceramide synthesis mediated by CerS6 is critical for the activation and function of both T and B cells, and thus CerS6 can a valid therapuetic target for the control of cGVHD. To test the hypothesis, we propose to pursue two Specific Aims: 1) Define the role of CerS6 in T- and B-cell responses in the development of cGVHD after allogeneic HCT; 2) Determine the therapeutic effect of CerS6-inhibitor in the control of cGVHD. If Aims are achieved as expected, the project will set a platform for further studying how sphingolipid metabolism affects adaptive immunity and identify novel molecular targets for manipulating immune response.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Background and Anticipated Impacts on VA Patient Care: Of the 5.6 million patients treated by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in FY11, 14.6% had a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, the fourth most common health condition treated by the VHA, and the leading cause of disability in the United States.(1,2) Advanced osteoarthritis of the hip and knee is treated with total joint arthroplasty (TJA), roughly 11,000 of which were performed in VHA in fiscal year 2011. The overall risks of complications and death in total joint arthroplasty are relatively low (5% and <1%  respectively), but certain patient characteristics (e.g., diabetes, obesity, smoking, alcohol misuse) have been associated with dramatically higher risks. Currently, orthopedic surgeons in VHA have no systematic and validated way of using a patient's demographic and clinical profile to estimate their personalized risk of complications or death related to TJA. Patients also vary substantially in how much they benefit from this common and expensive procedure. As with the estimation of risks, orthopedic surgeons in VHA have no systematic and validated way to estimate patients' personalized likelihood of improvement. It is impossible to balance risks and benefits unless they can be accurately and reliably quantified, a capability currently unavailable to orthopedic surgeons in VHA.  The development and validation of a risk, benefit, and satisfaction calculator, that draws from both electronic health record and manually entered data, would allow orthopedic surgeons to easily and accurately estimate both the expected risks and benefits of TJA for each candidate. These data could then be used within a shared decision making (SDM) framework for more accurate and reliable patient informed consent, including the identification of modifiable risk factors (e.g., weight, smoking) that should be addressed before these elective procedures, and more effective SDM that maximizes effectiveness, safety, patient preferences, satisfaction, and therefore value. Aim 1: Develop and validate a total joint arthroplasty risk calculator for the VHA population. Using the most recent three years of VHA Corporate Date Warehouse (CDW) and VA Surgical Quality Improvement Project (VASQIP) data including roughly 30,000 total joint arthroplasty cases, we will merge data on outcomes, especially death and major complications, and many known and candidate predictors of outcomes. Aim 2: Develop and validate a total joint arthroplasty benefit calculator for the VHA population. Patients (n = 1200) scheduled to undergo TJA at three high volume VA facilities (Palo Alto, San Francisco, Minneapolis) will be recruited to provide pre-operative symptom, functioning, expectation, and quality of life data and then followed up for reassessment one year later. These data will then be linked with VASQIP and CDW data in order to develop predictive benefit models, especially changes in functioning and pain, based on the pre-operative and other (demographic and clinical) data. Aim 3: Develop and validate a total joint arthroplasty patient satisfaction calculator. Because the predictors of risks and benefits may be different than  the predictors of satisfaction, we will also develop a patient satisfaction model using data from the 1200 patients described in Aim 2. Aim 4: Develop and pilot test the calculator interface and related decision support functionality. Once the models are developed, we will develop and pilot test a CDW-integrated risk and benefit calculator and decision support system that might be used within a SDM framework. The goal will be to visually display where the patient exists in the risk/benefit space, identify possible opportunities to modify risk and benefit factors, and provide  resources and information to facilitate possible prehabilitation.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed study is to explore the potential therapeutic benefit of a novel approach to rehabilitation of motor control of the paretic distal upper limb in stroke survivors. This multimodality treatment combines administration of a pharmacological agent for reducing unwanted neuromuscular hyperexcitability with a training paradigm focused on expanding exploration of the muscle activation workspace. In our previous research, we have observed striking deficits in the generation of proper muscle activation patterns in the hand. Motoneuronal hyperexcitability, especially of the long finger-flexors, is readily apparent, as is a diminished capacity to appropriately modulate activation patterns according to task. The proposed study would directly address these complications. Accordingly, we will pursue the following aims:  Aim 1: Determine the extent to which anti-serotonergic agents outperform conventional medications in reducing hyperexcitability post-stroke without impacting voluntary activation or alertness. Tizanidine hydrochloride, a clinically administered anti-spasticity medication, has been shown to effectively reduce motoneuron hyperexcitability, presumably through noradrenergic pathways, but causes serious side effects including somnolence. In preliminary studies we identified a promising alternative drug, the anti-serotonergic agent cyproheptadine hydrochloride, which was able to reduce hyperexcitability without reducing voluntary strength for single doses. We will compare the effects of tizanidine and cyproheptadine at chronic dosages. We hypothesize that: cyproheptadine will be more effective than tizanidine in reducing unwanted hyperexcitability without diminishing strength or increasing somnolence.  Aim 2: Assess the efficacy of using a multimodality intervention combining monoaminergic agents with upper extremity training. We anticipate that combining administration of the monoaminergic drug found effective in Aim 1 to reduce flexor hyperexcitability with focused training to alter muscle activation patterns will facilitate rehabilitation. Two different training techniques will be compared, one focusing directly on the training of muscle activation patterns through a custom computer game and the other utilizing a novel occupational therapy training protocol. We hypothesize that: the combined therapy of the drug with the training will lead to greater functional improvement over either drug administration or therapeutic training alone. Further, we hypothesize that: for the groups receiving multimodal training, improvements in motor control, will be greater for those training with the electromyographically controlled computer games.  The proposed study is aimed at contributing to the establishment of new techniques for maximizing recovery of motor function of the paretic upper limb post-stroke, especially in individuals with more severe distal impairment. The results of this study will have immediate import for clinical practice for stroke rehabilitation.',\n",
       " 'Background: Precision medicine is an innovative approach that takes into account individual genetic differences to inform personalized decisions that can improve diagnosis, prognosis, risk assessment, treatment and disease prevention. Genetic services, including genetic testing and genetic consultation are fundamental to precision medicine. Genetic services have not yet been systematically adopted in many Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities because of their complexity, the limited genetics knowledge and expertise of clinicians, and organizational barriers to utilization. Nonetheless, the demand for precision medicine within the VA is increasing, and understanding optimal care arrangements for common referral reasons for genetic consultation will be crucial to planning for high-quality and high-value precision medicine for our Veterans.  There is substantial variability in the type of genetic consultation available (e.g., cancer, neuro- or reproductive genetics), the expected role of the genetic consultant (i.e., diagnostic, procedural or care management) and in the care arrangements for these consultations in the VA (i.e., care model, mode of delivery and VA or non-VA care). Having different options for care arrangements for precision medicine can be beneficial, but only if the care arrangements are matched to the needs and preferences of both patients and the referring providers, and result in safe, effective and efficient care coordination. However, currently the variation in care arrangements for precision medicine in the VHA depends on available local resources, such as genetics expertise on-site or available through a telehealth service agreement, rather than care arrangements that are flexible and congruent with patient and provider needs and preferences.  Objectives: The goal of this VA HSR&D IIR proposal is to evaluate care coordination for precision medicine, including the care coordination approaches and activities and their effects according to available care arrangements for common reasons for genetic consultation in the VA. We will conduct the following aims: Aim 1. Describe the precision medicine care coordination approaches and activities at VA facilities according to the care arrangement (i.e., model, mode of delivery, and setting), including: the structures of care that facilitate or hinder referral for genetic consultation, referral reasons, referral volume, expected role of the consultant, and successful completion of genetic consults using data extracted from the Corporate Data Warehouse. Aim 2. Describe the effects of care coordination approaches and activities for patients who have completed a genetic consult according to the care arrangement, including: (a) genetic testing uptake and (b) extent of health care utilization (e.g., uptake of procedures, imaging, treatment) as recommended by the consulting clinician. Aim 3. Characterize the contextual factors (patient, provider, and inner and outer setting) influencing precision medicine care coordination approaches and activities (Aim 1); and their effects for patients who have completed a genetic consult (Aim 2). Aim 4. Develop measures of precision medicine care coordination approaches and activities for common reasons for genetics referral using expert panel methods.  Methods: We will conduct a retrospective, observational study using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We will leverage the VA?s world-class electronic health record to identify records from patients for whom a genetic consultation has been requested. We will extract data from these records using natural language processing and manual chart review (Aims 1 and 2). We will conduct qualitative interviews with key informants (Aim 3), and we will use expert panel methods to develop care coordination measures (Aim 4).  Impact: Synthesis of the project findings will guide decisions at every level of the healthcare system, from the individual clinical encounter for genetic health care services to system-wide policy decisions regarding workforce preparedness, infrastructure needs, as well as optimal care arrangements for precision medicine, with the goal to ensure high-quality and high-value precision medicine for our Veterans.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract:  This application is for the formation of an Adult Clinical Center in response to RFA-RM-15-015 ?Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Clinical Centers (U01)? (MoTrPAC).  Physical activity is an important lifestyle behavior that has been shown to be associated with morbidity and mortality from numerous chronic diseases. This has led to current public health recommendations of 150 min/wk of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 min/wk of vigorous physical activity to achieve significant health- related benefits, and for recommendations to engage in resistance exercise. Despite the abundance of data to support physical activity as a key lifestyle factor that can prevent, delay, or reverse the onset of a variety of health-related conditions, the specific underlying physiological mechanisms and pathways by which this occurs are not fully established.  Our team of investigators is well-positioned to be an Adult Clinical Center and achieve the goals and objectives outlined in this RFA. We have the capacity in Pittsburgh to recruit, retain, train, and assess the 450 participants that are required at each Adult Clinical Center. We will recruit 450 participants at the Pittsburgh Adult Clinical Center, which will include untrained subjects who will be randomized to the intervention (72% of the sample, N=324) or control condition (12% of the sample, N=54) and trained subjects (16% of the sample, N=72).  Untrained participants will be randomized to one of the following for a period of 12 weeks: 1) Control (UN- CON) that will maintain their current level of physical activity; 2) Moderate-Intensity Physical Activity (UN-MOD) that will progress to 150 min/wk of supervised moderate-intensity endurance physical activity; 3) Vigorous- Intensity Physical Activity (UN-VIG) that will progress to 75 min/wk of supervised vigorous-intensity endurance physical activity; 4) Resistance Training (UN-RES) that will engage in supervised resistance exercise. In addition, exercise trained participants (50% endurance trained, 50% resistance trained) will be recruited and will undergo baseline testing only.  Thus, we propose to form an Adult Clinical Center at the University of Pittsburgh to achieve the following objectives of MoTrPAC: 1. To recruit, retain, and collect data on 450 participants (378 untrained and 72 trained) at the Pittsburgh site  that will contribute to the 2,700 total participants across the Adult Clinical Centers. 2. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our training program, we will compare changes in cardiorespiratory  fitness in untrained participants randomized to 12-weeks of moderate-intensity endurance exercise training  (UN-MOD), vigorous-intensity endurance exercise training (UN-VIG), resistance training (UN-RES) or control (UN-CON). 3. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our training program, we will compare changes in musculoskeletal  fitness in untrained participants randomized to 12-weeks of UN-MOD, UN-VIG, UN-RES, or UN-CON. 4. To compare cardiorespiratory fitness in participants recruited as endurance trained to participants  randomized to UN-MOD and UN-VIG following 12 weeks of training. 5. To compare musculoskeletal fitness in participants recruited as endurance trained to participants randomized  to UN-RES following 12 weeks of training. 6. To collect phenotypic data that will allow for characterization of the study participants. These data will be  provided to the Coordinating Center and utilized by the Bioinformatics Center, Metabolomics and Proteomics  Analysis Sites, and Genomics, Epigenomics, and Transcriptomics Analysis Sites. 7. To collect biological data according to the study protocol that will provide data to examine the molecular and  cellular transducers in response to acute and chronic exposure to endurance or resistance exercise training.  These data will be provided to the Coordinating Center and utilized by the Bioinformatics Center,  Metabolomics and Proteomics Analysis Sites, and Genomics, Epigenomics, and Transcriptomics Sites.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) jointly propose the creation of a University of Texas Adult Clinical Center (UTACC) for the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC). We will integrate resources and combine our expertise to provide a state-of-the-art center for comprehensive studies on physical activity in adults. The Specific Aims of the UTACC are: 1) To participate in the planning of the multi-center trial; 2) To enroll 450 participants in the acute and chronic exercise training studies, conduct physiological assessments, and collect biospecimens (muscle, adipose, and blood); and 3) To analyze and interpret outcome data and disseminate findings to the scientific community. We will use innovative tools to maximize participant retention and enhance fidelity and adherence to the exercise training protocols. The UTACC will have a significant impact on the MoTrPAC ? and advance the field of exercise science ? based on our strengths, feasibility of the proposed study, and expected outcomes: The strengths of the UTACC include our long-track record of performing human studies on molecular transducers of exercise; shared resources and years of networking through the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center network and the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium; and our success with enrolling understudied populations such as older individuals and Hispanics-Latinos. The feasibility for the UTACC is high due to our experience with clinical trials on physical activity; our substantial expertise in collecting muscle and adipose biopsies in humans undergoing exercise studies; and our access to outstanding clinical research facilities in which to conduct human research in a safe environment. Expected outcomes of this program include the determination of baseline molecular signatures associated with metabolic health and physical performance; the integration of multi-omic data for the elucidation of molecular networks that control metabolic responses to exercise and how they influence physical performance; and discovery of novel mediators (proteins, metabolites, miRNAs) of the beneficial effects of exercise.',\n",
       " 'Background: Of the two approaches to performing cardiac catheterization, cardiologists in the VA and US overwhelmingly choose the approach that is known to be less comfortable and more dangerous to patients and more costly to the health care system. The trans-radial approach (TRA), which is accessed via the wrist, is more comfortable for patients; is much safer with half the rate of bleeding complications; and has lower overall costs per episode of care than the trans-femoral approach (TFA), which is accessed via the groin. Yet, today in the US TRA is used in only 25%-30% of cardiac catheterizations, and in the VA is used for just over 40% of catheterizations. The reasons are that TFA predominates in the fellowships where cardiologists train to perform catherizations; certain aspects of TRA, such as the anatomy of the radial artery, make it initially more challenging than TFA; and there is a lack of training resources that address the needs for hands-on training, feedback from an expert, and training of the team. This challenge is common to many medical and surgical specialties where new, superior procedures emerge regularly. We previously developed and piloted a coaching intervention to help cath labs become ?TRA-dominant.? The coaching intervention was team-based, included hands-on instruction with multiple opportunities for corrective feedback, and included a period of support and accountability beyond a training session. The pilot test garnered positive reports from participating teams; however, we do not know if it successfully increases use of TRA. Nor do we know if the coaching intervention works the way we believe it does, through creating a non-punitive atmosphere where participants develop self- efficacy with TRA, overcome the steep learning curve and become proficient. Finally, we do not know the budget impact of the coaching intervention, and whether the costs may be offset by the savings from reduced complications and associated costs. Objectives: Our objective is to improve the VA?s ability to systematically implement new technically challenging, evidence-based clinical procedures. We have 3 aims. Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of a successfully-piloted, team-based coaching intervention in increasing implementation of radial-artery access cardiac catheterization. Aim 2: Adapt, test and refine a conceptual model of team-based coaching for implementation of new procedures based on the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework. Aim 3: Perform a cost analysis of the coaching intervention and effects on costs per episode of care. Methods: We will use a stepped wedge design (i.e., graduated participation) to maximize validity and permit formative evaluation of the coaching intervention to improve it in real time. The primary outcome will be change in number of TRAs as a function of all catheterizations. Secondary outcomes will include improvements in complications, and cost per catheterization. We will conduct qualitative interviews and structured surveys at baseline, again just after the coaching intervention and a third time at 6 months follow-up to adapt, test and refine a conceptual model of team-based implementation that can inform modifying the coaching intervention to other clinical procedures and settings by understanding how the coaching intervention affects factors such as different types of perceived evidence related to TRA, contextual factors related to psychological safety, and team self-efficacy and outcome expectancy. Aim 3 will include two components: 1) estimate the costs of the organizational efforts needed to implement the coaching intervention, and 2) assess the effect of the coaching intervention aimed to increase adoption of TRA on healthcare costs. This will help establish the business case for the coaching intervention cost. Trial data suggests TRA leads to substantial cost savings. By developing a VA business case for the coaching intervention, we will help foster support for dissemination of the proctoring intervention.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in adolescence. To improve our ability to predict and prevent suicidal behavior, there is a pressing need for research in this area to advance beyond identifying risk factors toward a greater focus on the mechanisms of risk for this behavior. In particular, elucidating the neural pathways underlying risk for suicidal behavior is important insofar as such work may yield specific and modifiable targets for clinical intervention. The adoption of new experimental paradigms providing experimental control over potentially modifiable risk factors has been recommended as a means of meaningfully advancing the field in this regard. Although yet to be applied to the study of suicidality, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), in conjunction with measures of electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs), may hold promise as an experimental paradigm in the study of potentially modifiable risk factors, and underlying neural mechanisms, for suicidality. One such risk factor of particular relevance to suicide in adolescence is state-sensitive aspects of impulsivity. Impulsivity has been consistently linked with suicidality, with this association appearing to be stronger in adolescence than adulthood. As a first step toward investigating whether modulation of impulsivity and associated neural pathways may yield clinically meaningful changes in risk for adolescent suicidal behavior, the proposed R21 is a proof-of-concept study evaluating the potential for tDCS targeting brain regions associated with behavioral impulsivity (right inferior frontal gyrus [rIFG]) and cognitive impulsivity (left orbitofrontal cortex [lOFC]) to modulate these facets of impulsivity in a sample of adolescent suicide attempters. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive anodal tDCS over the rIFG, anodal tDCS over the lOFC, or a sham stimulation condition, in a three-group design. Task-based measures of behavioral and cognitive impulsivity will be administered before and after tDCS or sham stimulation. Additionally, EEG and ERP data will be collected during the impulsivity tasks, and resting-state EEG data will be collected pre- and post-tDCS administration to confirm engagement of the targeted brain regions and to delineating the neural pathways underlying the effects of tDCS on impulsivity. This study is relevant to the research objective, of clarifying the neural circuitry profiles related to suicide risk, outlined by the NIH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention in their recent research agenda for suicide prevention. It is also consistent with NIMH?s Strategic Plan, which emphasizes the need for research on biomarkers and behavioral indicators of psychopathology, and for research utilizing neurobehavioral methodologies.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Appropriate social behavior often demands self-control. Both neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, addiction) as well as disease states (e.g., HIV positivity, brain lesions) can lead to changes in the neural mechanisms involved in self-control - often with effects most strongly manifested in social contexts. Understanding how the brain identifies social contexts, evaluates potential outcomes, and guides selection of appropriate behavior would provide insight into these disorders and the development of new treatments. Recent work - including from our group - demonstrates that neural activity in temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) signals information relevant for identifying social context, that these social signals influence valuation processes in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventral striatum (VS), and that social value signals inform reward comparison processes in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Yet, this now-standard model for social decision making leaves unanswered key questions about brain function and dysfunction, especially how social contexts can potentiate maladaptive decision making observed in disorders. We propose and empirically test a novel two-stage neural circuit model of social decisions. The first stage involves identification of a social context, which we hypothesize relies on computations in TPJ that shape subsequent valuation and decision processes elsewhere. In a second stage, control processes shape ongoing behavior toward social goals (e.g., maximizing the acquisition of information about others, shaping interpersonal reputations), which we refer to as social control. We propose to evaluate this model using an integrated set of experiments conducted in humans and monkeys. We will use similar tasks that manipulate the nature and quality of social contexts (e.g., cooperative or competitive) for decision making, involve both social and non-social reward outcomes, and provide complementary information from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans, neurophysiological recordings in monkeys, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in both species (including simultaneous neural recordings in monkeys).',\n",
       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Abstract Current application rates suggest that more than half of OEF/OIF Veterans will eventually apply for some form of service-connection, with approximately 100,000 Veterans per year being evaluated for psychiatric conditions. Veterans applying for service-connection for psychiatric conditions are in distress, and often are having occupational difficulties, but these are unaddressed during a typical Compensation and Pension evaluation. Counseling that addresses beneficiaries' concerns about losing compensation payments if working for pay, when supplemented by vocational supports, has been associated with increased employment among people disabled by chronic psychiatric conditions. Our group has developed an online Benefits Counseling intervention tailored to help Veterans applying for service-connection engage in work-related activities. We have demonstrated the efficacy of a face-to-face version of Benefits Counseling in a completed RR&D-funded six-month clinical trial in which Veterans assigned to Benefits Counseling worked significantly more days than controls,(p<.05, effect size = 0.69), reflecting an average of three more days of employment at six month follow-up. We then used a supplement from RR&D to develop a web-based version of this counseling, so that the counseling could be delivered without a counselor on-site. The web-based intervention was modified based on user feedback, but the extent to which it will be used by Veterans at home and how it will impact their behavior is unknown. In the proposed clinical trial, Veterans working two or fewer days per week who are presenting for a Compensation & Pension examination for a psychiatric disorder will be assessed at baseline and then urged to log in afterwards to a website for random assignment to either Remotely-Delivered Benefits Counseling (n=65) or Veterans Benefits Administration web sites (n=65), and will then be assessed at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after randomization in order to calculate standardized group mean differences between the slopes over time. The primary outcome measure will be the treatment-by-time slope of hours of paid work. Exploratory analyses will estimate associations of potential mediators of treatment response with this outcome. The proposed study will provide estimates of the efficacy of remotely-delivered Benefits Counseling initiated at Compensation and Pension examinations, a widely-used point of contact with VA.\",\n",

       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This award will support the training and career development of a junior investigator in cardiovascular epidemiology and pharmacogenomics, with special emphasis on the role of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and preventive treatment. Despite significant strides in prevention and management, CVD remains a leading cause of death in the United States. Pharmacogenomics, the study of how an individual's genome affects their treatment response, has expanded our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of CVD. However, gene-drug interactions have been difficult to assess in epidemiologic and clinical studies, in part because of the extraordinarily large sample sizes required for genome-wide association studies of these interactions and lack of strong candidate genes. COMT, which encodes a key enzyme in degradation of catecholamines including epinephrine, norepinephrine and catechol estrogen, is a strong candidate gene with plausible physiological links to both CVD and drug metabolism. COMT rs4680 is a well-studied and extremely common genetic polymorphism which results in a 3-4 fold reduction in enzymatic activity. The COMT genetic variant encoding the low-activity form of the enzyme, was associated with increased CVD risk and higher levels of triglycerides, systolic blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c in the Women's (Genome) Health Study (N=23,294). Interestingly over the 10 years of the study, women homozygous for the COMT low-activity genotype randomized to aspirin treatment had lower rates of CVD. Conversely, COMT high-activity homozygous women randomized to aspirin had higher CVD rates compared to placebo. Given the widespread use of aspirin for prevention of CVD, and the high prevalence of COMT rs4680 genetic variants, it is imperative that we understand the generalizability, mechanism and impact of the COMT locus itself and drugs that may share common molecular pathways and networks with it. This translational research proposal addresses these gaps by: 1) an epidemiologic study of COMT association with incidence of subclinical and clinical CVD in a multi-ethnic cohort; 2) using large-scale gene-expression and pharmacogenomic data to elucidate COMT molecular pathways and interacting drugs, and 3) conducting clinical studies to examine effects of these drugs on ex-vivo and in-vivo platelet function. As an emerging genetic locus with pleiotropic CVD and drug interaction effects, COMT is an excellent model system to probe the multiple molecular pathways and networks involved in cardiovascular function, disease and treatment and thus guide the development of novel strategies to attenuate CVD risk, and a promising example in which to develop personal expertise in cardiovascular epidemiology, systems biology, clinical trials, and other key career development milestones.

       " 'Many studies, including some by the PI, reveal that cumulative risk - simultaneous exposure to multiple environmental, psychological, and biological risks - resulting from poverty leads to pervasive emotional and physical health problems as early as infancy. However, there remains a critical knowledge gap as to whether the effects of poverty and cumulative risk originate before birth. We propose that prenatal exposure to cumulative risk is a key pathway by which the adverse effects of poverty are transmitted to fetuses during gestation. Moreover, this prenatal exposure to cumulative risk may also perturb a mother?s neural adaptation to parenting, which further increases the infant?s likelihood of receiving harsh parenting postnatally. The proposed study is innovative because it utilizes a unique intergenerational and prospective design. In a total of 200 pregnant women (110 low-income and 90 middle-income), cumulative prenatal risk will be assessed in each trimester (12, 22, and 32 weeks gestation). Shortly after the infant?s birth, neuroimaging of the infant and the mother will be performed to assess fetal brain development (using MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI) and maternal neural adaptation to parenting during pregnancy (using fMRI). The overall objective of the proposed study is to identify the prenatal pathways by which poverty perturbs neural outcomes of two generations - infants and their mothers. To achieve this objective, we will pursue three Aims. Aim#1 - Identify the relations between poverty and cumulative prenatal risk. We propose that lower family income is associated with cumulative risk in environmental (stressful life events, poor quality home environment), psychological (perceived stress, negative mood) and biological (elevated cortisol, reduced oxytocin) systems during pregnancy. Aim#2 - Identify the relations among poverty, cumulative prenatal risk, and brain morphology and connectivity in newborns. We propose that lower family income is associated with reduced volume, white matter integrity, and functional connectivity among the neural stress circuit of the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex among newborns. Cumulative prenatal risk mediates the link between low income and newborn neural outcomes. Aim#3 - Identify the relations among poverty, cumulative prenatal risk, and neural adaptation to parenting in new mothers. We propose that cumulative prenatal risk mediates the links between family income and altered neural function for parental motivation and emotion regulation among new mothers. The proposed research is significant because it can offer scientific evidence to support prenatal intervention to reduce exposure to cumulative risk among low-income pregnant women. Compared to postnatal interventions with either mothers or infants, prenatal intervention is more effective and economical since it can potentially prevent poverty?s adverse effects in both generations by intervening with mothers only, prenatally. Furthermore, the current study will lay the groundwork for a new investigator?s research program for following a cohort of infants and their mothers starting from the first trimester of pregnancy to later developmental periods.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late onset disorder causing weakness of eyelid and pharyngeal, and proximal limb muscles. A major symptom of OPMD is swallowing difficulty (dysphagia) due to weakened pharyngeal muscles. Patients often experience choking or aspiration pneumonia, and may require a feeding tube in later stages of disease. At present, the exact molecular mechanisms of pathology are unknown. The only available options to treat dysphagia in OPMD patients are temporary, usually surgical procedures to decrease resistance in the throat to improve swallowing. Autosomal dominant OPMD patients harbor a mutation in the gene for the nuclear mRNA processing protein PABPN1, which causes the N-terminal polyalanine stretch of PABPN1 to expand from 10 to 11-18 residues. PABPN1 plays key roles in mRNA processing including polyadenylation of nuclear transcripts and the alternative polyadenylation and cleavage pathway. PABPN1 is expressed in all tissues, but mutation causes late-onset pathology only in a specific subset of skeletal muscles. How mutation of this ubiquitously expressed protein leads to late-onset pathology in specific tissues remains an open question. Skeletal muscle tissue is capable of regeneration. Closely associated with multinucleated, post-mitotic myofibers in adult muscles is a pool of stem cells known as satellite cells. Upon muscle damage, satellite cells become activated to proliferate, differentiate, and fuse with each other and existing myofibers. This process, known as myogenesis, restores muscle architecture and function. Interestingly, some of the muscles most severely affected by OPMD, including pharyngeal muscles, are more highly regenerative than other skeletal muscles. The hypothesis driving the work proposed here is that mutant PABPN1 disrupts mRNA biogenesis and decreases the myogenic capacity of pharyngeal satellite cells, leading to pathology due to the unusually high demand for myogenesis in pharyngeal muscles. We will take an integrative in vitro and in vivo approach using a novel mouse model that is the first to accurately copy the genotype of OPMD patients. This mouse model expresses mutant PABPN1 in all tissues. Because PABPN1 is known to impact mRNA metabolism, satellite cells from pharyngeal muscles will be isolated and assayed for RNA phenotypes (Aim 1). The myogenic program can be recapitulated in vitro and used to quantify specific stages of myogenesis. Therefore, primary activated satellite cells, known as myoblasts, from pharyngeal muscles will be isolated and used to quantify the effects of mutant PABPN1 on the specific stages of myogenesis in vitro (Aim 2). This model will then be used to assay the effect of mutant PABPN1 on myogenesis in pharyngeal muscle in vivo (Aim 3). The long-term objective of this work is to understand how mutant PABPN1 affects pharyngeal satellite cell biology and potentially identify targets for new pharmacologic OPMD treatments.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Approximately one-third of adults in the United States have prehypertension which increases the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Early detection of prehypertension offers a window of opportunity to prevent progression to overt hypertension and CVD through behavioral modification. Sympathetic activation and arterial stiffness are both deleterious factors that concomitantly contribute to elevated blood pressure. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programs have been shown to reduce blood pressure in prehypertensive adults, but the mechanisms for the reduction remain speculative. We will systematically examine 24-hour blood pressure regulation and two potential mechanisms for the anti- hypertensive effects of MBSR by directly assessing muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and arterial stiffness. Aim 1 will determine if MBSR improves 24-hour blood pressure regulation, aim 2 will determine if MBSR reduces sympathetic neural activity, and aim 3 will determine if MBSR will decrease arterial stiffness in prehypertensive adults. This project will also provide advanced research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in health-related fields at Michigan Technological University, consistent with the goals of the Academic Research Enhancement Award (R15) mission. Our central hypothesis is that MBSR will: 1) improve nocturnal blood pressure dipping and / or reduce early-morning surges, 2) reduce resting MSNA and attenuate the neural cardiovascular responses to acute stress, and 3) decrease arterial stiffness. We will utilize a parallel, randomized, control design (MBSR vs. active control) that includes gold-standard techniques for measuring blood pressure (24-hour ambulatory assessment), MSNA (microneurography), and arterial stiffness (applanation tonometry). These studies will provide detailed insight how MBSR interventions influence neural and cardiovascular control in humans. Finally, this project would help to advance the potential for MBSR to be used for reducing the onset of hypertension and other cardiovascular risks, and findings from the proposed studies may help to direct future efficacy-related work.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION:  Micellar nanoparticles that mimic the size and shape of viral particles are attractive as a DNA delivery vehicle because of their improved colloidal stability and transport properties, ability to evade immune clearance, and high payload packaging capacity. Moreover, nanoparticle shape has explicitly been identified as an important factor determining their transport properties and delivery efficiency. However, there is no available nanoparticle synthesis method for packaging plasmid DNA payloads while allowing sufficient control over particle size and shape. Recently, we have shown that distinct shape control and tuning for DNA micelles can be achieved through complexation of plasmid DNA with engineered block or graft copolymers of polycation and poly (ethylene glycol) under controlled assembly conditions. In this proposed study, we will develop a synergistic research program comprising parallel and integrated experimental and computational strategies to (1) develop and understand new methods for DNA micelle assembly that permit scalable, high-uniformity synthesis with shape control and high stability; (2) reveal shape-dependent nanoparticle diffusion and transport properties in physiologically media in vitro and in vivo; and (3) demonstrate the delivery efficiency of a theranostic vector by shape-controlled DNA micelles and their imaging and therapeutic efficacy using mouse models of human metastatic cancers. The proposed study brings together a unique combination of expertise in DNA nanoparticle assembly, microfluidics-based single-particle analysis/fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, in vivo imaging, cancer theranostics, and computer simulations to address a crucial knowledge gap in the engineering and delivery of DNA nano-therapeutics. It will not only offer a new, generalizable method for synthesizing shape-controlled DNA micelles, but also provide a mechanistic understanding of shape- dependent transport properties of nanoparticles. Moreover, the integrated nature of our experimental and computational approach establishes a new paradigm that will greatly accelerate the discovery and development of new DNA nanoparticle systems for efficient gene medicine delivery.',\n",
       " \"Chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) is a worldwide health problem that can lead to cirrhosis, end stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of the HCV epidemic, the incidence of HCC is rising at an alarming rate and US veterans with cirrhosis have 5-8% lifetime risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). New, highly effective, antiviral therapies for HCV have recently become available, but these have had little impact on development of HCC and it is virtually unknown how the virus causes cancer. Our group has been studying the effects of HCV on the host cellular enzyme telomerase, which is a reverse transcriptase (RT) that repairs short chromosomal DNA 3' ?telomeric? ends in dividing cells. Adequate telomere lengths must be maintained to avoid chromosomal injury and to support continuous cellular replication. Consequently, telomerase is induced or upregulated in the majority of malignant cells and has proven to be a valuable cellular target enzyme for cancer detection and anticancer therapy. Our laboratory has recently shown that HCV induces telomerase early after infection and we hypothesize that this behavior contributes to the virus' oncogenicity. Induction of telomerase is likely facilitated in part through the actions of HCV proteins core, NS5A and NS3-4A in the host hepatocyte. We have also demonstrated that HCV core and NS5A proteins transcriptionally activate TERT promoter and that NS3-4A, the viral protease-helicase complex, binds specifically to TERT and stimulates telomerase catalytic activity. Our data are the first to show that HCV can induce TERT expression as well as catalytically activate host telomerase. The overlying hypothesis of this application is that HCV reactivates telomerase through initial interactions with the Wnt/?-catenin signaling system which then drives TERT promoter to open transcription. This is likely accomplished by core and NS5A which have been shown to stabilize activated Wnt/?-catenin signaling complexes. We also hypothesize that NS3-4A, a multifunctional protease-helicase, increases telomerase catalytic activity by optimizing the enzyme's type II processivity. By increasing telomerase processivity, NS3-4A thus promotes efficiency of telomere repair and facilitates neoplastic progression. Collectively, the actions of the virus upregulate chromosomal maintenance and repair mechanisms and promote hepatocarcinogenesis. The long term goals of our work are two-fold: we wish to determine the mechanisms of how the virus induces telomerase expression and increases telomerase catalytic activity. Achievement of both of these goals will lead to the identification of cellular events that are undoubtedly important for HCC development and ultimately treatment. This approach is highly relevant for understanding how HCV promotes liver cancer and the data will lay a firm foundation for eventual drug targeting of telomerase or the viral helicase with anticancer agents.\",\n",
       " \"The previous period of Merit support allowed us to develop novel protocols for immuno-affinity isolation and characterization of very pure protein aggregates. We began with C. elegans models of neurodegenerative diseases, and then applied the same protocols to purify A?42- and tau-containing aggregates from affected hippocampal tissue of Alzheimer's patients, seeking aggregate proteins that differentiate them from age-matched controls. We now propose to apply our experience with these models to develop novel therapeutic agents that might delay, prevent, or even reverse Alzheimer's and Parkinson's pathology, through the following Aims: Aim 1. We have access through Dr. Sue Griffin, our collaborator, to a tissue bank of tissue samples from Alzheimer's Disease (caudal hippocampus) and Parkinson's Disease (substantia nigra), from which we will isolate aggregates by immuno-affinity for A?42, tau and ?-synuclein. We propose to cross-link these aggregates, thoroughly digest them with trypsin, and identify cross-linked peptide pairs that will reveal the protein-protein interactions that mediated their conglomeration. We will use state-of-the-art ?click chemistry? reagents to create, tag and recover cross-link sites, and Xlink Identifier software to analyze mass-spectrometry data. To visualize, integrate and interpret the protein-protein interactions thus revealed, we will create protein-interaction networks and analyze them with tools adapted to the nonfunctional interactions that predominate in protein aggregation. Aim 2. Proteomics data from Aim 1 will define critical protein-protein interactions within aggregates containing tau, A?42 or ?-synuclein, which are highly enriched in Alzheimer or Parkinson brain samples. These protein- protein interactions will be ranked on the basis of their predicted propensity (by ?G estimation) and stability (by molecular-dynamic simulations). The top 10 protein interfaces from each pulldown will then serve as targets for in silico screening of drug libraries developed to disrupt protein-protein interactions. Such libraries, constructed in diverse ways, include many `PPII' drugs designed to block specific protein-pair interactions, but which have frequently found applications beyond their original targets. For each target, we will perform initial screens of PPII-library drugs in silico, from which the top candidates will be retested in molecular-dynamic simulations. Aim 3. The drugs predicted in silico to most effectively disrupt key protein interactions (Aim 2) will be tested in vivo for reduction of aggregate formation?first in human neuronal-cell cultures expressing APPSwe (forming amyloid aggregates) or split-GFP::tau (fluorescing upon tau oligomerization). For drugs that are protective in either assay, tests will also be conducted in C. elegans aggregation models expressing A?42, tau, or ?-synuclein. Biotinylated versions of 4?6 top candidates will be assessed for activity, and active biotinylated drugs will be used to pull down proteins to which the drug attaches. This will be done initially in C. elegans, using an in-house `genomewide' RNAi-knockdown library, and will then be cross-checked by introducing shRNA constructs into cultured neuronal cells. Targets producing maximal protection will then be tested to ask whether drug efficacy is partially redundant with RNAi knockdown, as expected for a target that mediates the drug's protective effects. By discovery of novel drugs designed specifically to reduce aggregation, we expect to find far more effective therapeutic and preventative agents than the limited drugs currently available. Based on our observations that many aggregate components are shared among diverse neurodegenerative-disease models, at least some of these drugs may also prove effective against a variety of other neurodegenerative diseases including orphan diseases.\",\n",
       " 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a major form of liver cancer, is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Its prognosis is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%. The national prevalence and mortality due to cirrhosis and HCC in VA health care users have been increased by 2.5 to 3-fold during the last decade. The predicted increasing trend of HCC incidence and HCC-related deaths in the US veterans group remains alarming. Chronic hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis, fatty liver, and exposure to hepatotoxins are the major risk factors for HCC development. The risk of HCC increases strikingly in HCV carriers with diabetes and obesity. Thus, HCC is a major cause of deaths and veterans? health issue. A single FDA-approved medical therapy for HCC, sorafenib only extends survival by approximately 3 months. Curative surgical options include hepatic resection and liver transplantation. However, very few patients are surgical candidates due to a late diagnosis of HCC. One of the major obstacles preventing the development of effective therapeutic agents is due to the potential existence of tumor stem cells (TSCs) in HCC. Most tumors contain a small percentage (1% to 2%) of TSC population that are believed to be responsible for resistance to chemotherapy, relapse, and metastasis. We have shown that a TSC-related protein, doublecortin- like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is induced in hepatotoxicity-induced liver injury, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC whereas a normal liver lacks DCLK1 expression. The elevated DCLK1 level promotes hepatoma cell migration, cell cycle progression, and HCC-like tumor growth. Our central hypothesis is that activation of DCLK1-expressing cells contributes to the development of hepatic neoplasia and, ultimately, HCC. Targeting the DCLK1-expressing subpopulation and DCLK1 regulated signaling will reduce the burden of cancer-related deaths. The proposed investigations rely on the use of primary human hepatocytes derived from normal and patient donors. We will determine the mechanism(s) which promote DCLK1-expressing human hepatocytes to acquire tumor characteristics. We will use cell culture and a unique mouse model with humanized/chimeric liver to test the hypothesis. We will also develop HCC patients-derived tumor xenografts to evaluate the impacts of targeting DCLK1 in HCC. Taken together, these studies will increase our understanding of the mechanism(s) that regulate hepatic neoplasia and will potentially validate DCLK1 as a new therapeutic target in HCC. These studies, if successful, will have a major impact on the field of cancer and veterans? health because DCLK1 also contributes to the tumor growth in pancreas, intestine, and colon. !',\n",
       " 'Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an often disabling disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects more than 2.5 million people worldwide. Current FDA approved disease modifying therapies for MS are only partially effective, are costly and have side effects. Thus, there is a need for the continued development of new treatment strategies and targets for successful management of MS. The antioxidant lipoic acid (LA) has been shown to reduce disease severity and T lymphocyte migration into the spinal cord in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). A small pilot trial of LA therapy showed reduced brain atrophy in MS patients compared to placebo. However, the mechanisms of action of LA are not fully understood, thus limiting advancement of this agent to large multi-site trials. We have shown that LA stimulates cyclic AMP (cAMP) production in immune cells. cAMP is a small molecule second messenger that has immunosuppressive function. Additionally, LA inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production and T cell activation. LA also exhibits anti-oxidant properties by activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NFE2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling cascade in response to oxidative stress. The goal of this grant is to determine the biochemical mechanisms by which LA may treat and/or halt progression of MS with the hope that we can translate our in vitro results to the in vivo setting. We hypothesize that LA has protective effects in MS and that these effects may be mediated in part by the cAMP and/or Nrf2 signaling cascades.  To accomplish the goals of this grant, the following objectives are planned: (1) Determine the effects of LA on human cells implicated in the pathogenesis of MS and the mechanisms that mediate these responses; (2) Determine if LA treatment enhances blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity and the mechanisms that mediate these responses; and (3) Determine the in vivo effects of LA in a specialized EAE model that develops cortical lesions. A better understanding of the mechanisms of action of LA will provide knowledge and insights for pursuing and maximizing the use of LA as a new treatment strategy for MS. Mechanistic understanding of LA will provide guidance in issues relating to toxicities, contraindications, and potentially in the diagnosis or treatment of different forms or stages of MS.',\n",
       " 'The ability to detect early cartilage damage in traumatic injury or degenerative arthritis has been limited, preventing treatment when therapies may be more beneficial. Depletion of proteoglycans/glycoproteins on the surface of the cartilage in these disorders results in unmasking of the underlying type II collagen (CII). This allows CII to serve as an immunologically recognizable target for monoclonal antibody to type II collagen (MabCII). MabCII can be fluorescently labeled for diagnosis of cartilage injury or cartilage degeneration or may be directly coupled to nanosomes encapsulating drugs for localized delivery to the cartilage lesion. Preliminary evidence shows a similar strategy can be used to target and recruit reparative chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells to the damaged site. In this application, MabCII will be used in a comprehensive treatment plan for directing reparative cells to lesions of the articular cartilage and meniscal cartilages. The therapeutic efficacy for repairing these cartilages will be monitored by an innovative fluorescent arthroscopy. In addition, we will optimize the recruitment and integration of the reparative cells in the cartilage lesions by reducing MMP production in the joint by intra-articular injection of an inhibitor of activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF- KB) pathway encapsulated in MabCII-targeted nanosomes. These procedures are extremely novel and paradigm shifting for the diagnosis and treatment of joint injury and disease. Our aims are: (1). To diagnose and characterize damaged and degenerative areas of articular surface and meniscal cartilages in the pig knee using a sensitive, MabCII antibody-guided method of fluorescent arthroscopy (FA). The knee of the domestic pig closely resembles a human joint in terms of joint size, weight-bearing requirements, and cartilage thickness and will be used in the characterization of surgically-induced injuries to meniscal and articular cartilages. The damage will be visualized through its binding to fluorescent MabCII using fluorescent arthroscopy, a new procedure that we have developed, and confirmed by histopathology. After FA characterization of the injury, (2) MabCII antibody will be used to target delivery and recruitment of reparative cells to the damaged areas of the knee joint cartilages. We will investigate the therapeutic efficacy of fluorescent, MabCII-targeted chondrocytes or mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow and adipose tissues intra-articularly injected into joints where articular or meniscal cartilages have been surgically damaged monitoring the cellular localization and persistence by FA. Cell to cell recruitment at the cartilage lesion in the knee will be facilitated by an innovative system of biotin/avidin ligands on the surface of the reparative cells and multivalent antibody recruitment of cells binding type II collagen. Reparative tissues will be analyzed over time by histopathology and gene expression by RT-PCR. We will (3) further optimize the recruitment and integration of replacement cells in the cartilage lesion by treatment with MabCII targeted nanosomes loaded with an inhibitor of the activation of the NF-?B pathway. The production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is known to be a factor in degradation of cartilage matrices. Diminishing MMP production will be a prototypic target for enhancing reparative efforts. The MabCII-targeted nanosomes encapsulating a selective inhibitor of human IKK-2, an activator of the NF-?B pathway, will be used as a local delivery system to reduce production of MMPs in damaged cartilage lesions prior to treatment with reparative cells. ! ! !',\n",
       " 'Cyclophilin-D (Cyp-D) is a peptidyl prolyl isomerase which catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl prolyl bonds and thereby regulates conformational changes of target proteins. Cyp-D is the only cyclophilin res- ident in mitochondria, and until recently it was best known for its effect on the mitochondrial permeability transi- tion pore. We recently discovered that Cyp-D interacts with two of the three mitochondrial transcription factors (i.e., TFB1M and TFB2M but not TFAM) and subsequently found that Cyp-D also interacts with the mitochon- drial RNA polymerase. Genetic silencing of Cyp-D in isolated cells disrupted mitochondrial gene expression re- sulting in a reduction in mitochondrial O2 consumption (VO2). More recently, working with a constitutive Cyp-D knock out (Cyp-D KO) mice, we showed also in vivo reductions in VO2 (at rest and exercise). Concomitantly, the respiratory exchange ratio increased suggesting a metabolic shift favoring utilization of carbohydrates over fat. Intriguingly, the exercise capacity was increased pointing to an adaptive response whereby O2 utilization efficiency was increased. Using in silico modeling, we have identified small molecules able to destabilize the interaction between Cyp-D and TFB2M. Thus, we hypothesize that Cyp-D plays a key role in oxygen me- tabolism by regulating mitochondrial gene expression and signaling an adaptive increase in oxygen utilization efficiency. We propose to further this hypothesis based on two specific aims. Specific Aim 1: De- signed to complete the characterization of the Cyp-D effects on mitochondrial gene expression using cardiac relevant tissue and examine additional downstream processes ? also mediated by Cyp-D ? that may impact cell respiration (structured in 4 Sub Aims). Sub-Aim 1, designed to completely characterize the interactions among key players of the mitochondrial transcription machinery and assess their dependency on Cyp-D PPI- ase activity; Sub-Aim 2, designed to confirm that the effects of Cyp-D on mitochondrial gene expression are HSP2 specific (as suggested by preliminary data) and to assess whether Cyp-D silencing could signal up- stream and affect the expression of nuclear-encoded proteins of respiratory complexes; Sub-Aim 3, designed to confirm that Cyp-D silencing reduces mitochondrial encoded subunits of the respiratory chain complexes and F1FoATP synthase and examine whether Cyp-D overexpression results in the opposite effect; and Sub- Aim 4, to investigate whether Cyp-D also acts as chaperone aiding in the assembly of respiratory complexes. Studies under Specific Aim 1 will be conducted in adult mouse primary cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and tissues from Cyp-D KO and wild-type (WT) mice when relevant. Cyp-D will be modulated by using lentiviral vectors harboring constructs to silence or overexpress Cyp-D and pharmacological inhibition using cyclosporine A (CsA) and newly identified small molecules. Specific Aim 2: Designed to determine the functional conse- quences of genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of Cyp-D in mice and examine the underlying adap- tive mechanisms leading to increased O2 utilization efficiency. Cyp-D activity will be reduced by using constitu- tive and conditional Cyp-D KO mice and by pharmacological inhibition with cyclosporine A and small molecules able to selectively destabilize the interaction between Cyp-D and TFB2M. With constitutive Cyp-D KO mice, we will assess whether the findings in cell systems after acute Cyp-D ablation also occur in vivo and examine the adaptive responses leading to increased O2 utilization efficiency. With conditional Cyp-D KO mice, we will as- sess the immediate effects of Cyp-D ablation and whether an adaptive response occurs, subsequently examin- ing whether similar effects can be elicited through pharmacological inhibition. Myocardial energy effects along with functional myocardial effects will be assessed using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of increase O2 utilization efficiency may have important implications for human physiology and disease and plan to also examine effects in acute conditions of reduced O2 availability using models of cardiac arrest and hemorrhagic shock.',\n",
       " '|| ABSTRACT Breakdown of the endothelial cell barrier is considered a defining pathological hallmark of multiple diseases. Indeed, sepsis accounts for more hospital deaths per year than any other condition in the United States, and the disease is currently devoid of any targeted pharmacological intervention. Critical to understanding how inflammation affects vascular barrier function is that endothelial cells throughout the circulatory system are not homogenous. Inflammation specifically affects vascular permeability through effects on the venous endothelium, whereas the arterial endothelium is not susceptible to inflammation-induced permeability and instead primarily regulates blood pressure and angiogenesis. Thus, a mechanistic view of how venous endothelial barrier function is regulated is essential to human health and disease. Our current understanding of vascular barrier function does not account for endothelial heterogeneity and the unique cell adhesion and signaling pathways specific to each endothelial cell type. Purinergic signaling has been identified as a key regulator of endothelial permeability; however the means by which purine nucleotides are brought into and affect the local environment has never been identified. We hypothesize that venous endothelial barrier function is regulated by a localized purinergic signaling cascade that controls the stability and expression of tight junction proteins. We will use three aims to test this concept. In Aim 1, we will determine roles for Pannexin 1 in regulating venous endothelial permeability. This aim will use novel methods for ex vivo vein isolation and measure transendothelial resistance and dye movement from endothelial cell specific Panx1 knockout mice and endothelial cell specific Panx1 over-expressing mice, as well in vivo testing using the cecal ligation puncture (CLP) septic model. In Aim 2, we will measure the relative contributions of different Adenosine Receptors (ARs) on endothelial barrier function. We will determine the differential role of CD39 and CD73 on adenosine receptor activation, using endothelial cell specific A2A and A2B floxed mice, as well as the relative contribution of PKA or PKC upon activation. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will define roles for claudin-11 in venous endothelial barrier function and as a target for TRPV4-mediated disruption of tight junctions. This aim will utilize state of the art calcium imaging to determine a role for TRPV4 in regulation of claudin-11 production, trafficking, assembly and stability. Claudin-11 is a novel claudin isoform whose role in barrier function is only beginning to be elucidated. Molecular manipulation of claudins will be used to demonstrate that claudin-11 is required for veins to be sensitive to calcium fluxes because it has the unique capacity to bind calmodulin, whereas claudin-5 does not. The feasibility of accomplishing these aims is underscored by all proposed knockout mice being in hand, an IRB in place for human samples, and strong preliminary data.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract    The proposed project is an investigation of the synergistic activity of antimicrobial combinations  against  carbapenem resistant  Enterobacteriaceae  (CRE).

Her  career  goal  is  to  become  a  leading  investigator  in  the  development,  implementation  and  interpretation  of  tests  for  detection  of  antimicrobial  synergy.  During  the  award  period,  she  will  obtain  a  Master  of  Science  in  Pharmacology  and  will  pursue  coursework in clinical and translational research. The proposed research will be carried out under  the  mentorship  of  James  Kirby,  MD,  D(ABMM),  an  NIH funded  investigator  at  Beth  Israel  Deaconess Medical Center whose laboratory investigates topics highly relevant to the proposed  project,  including  the  development  of  novel  antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  methods  and  the  investigation of new therapeutics for CRE. Dr. Brennan Krohn will be supported during the award  period by an advisory committee that includes Dr. George Eliopoulos, a world renowned expert  on antimicrobial synergy. In the proposed project, Dr. Brennan Krohn will initially test antimicrobial  combinations  against  a  comprehensive  collection  of  clinical  CRE  isolates  in  order  to  establish  combinatorial  spectra  of  activity.  For  this  part  of  the  project,  she  will  use  an  automated  checkerboard  array  microdilution  method  that  makes  use  of  the  HP  D300  inkjet  printer based  dispensing system.

       " \"Project Summary Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 cause millions of chronic infections. These viruses cause epithelial oral ?cold? sores and genital lesions, which recur lifelong due to reactivation from a latent viral reservoir in neurons. Clinical outcomes from HSV-1 infection are highly diverse, ranging from surface lesions with quite different rates of recurrence, to asymptomatic shedding, to severe and potentially lethal encephalitis. This variation is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including viral genetic differences, human genetic predisposition, and environmental variables. Animal models serve as the cornerstone of our molecular understanding of HSV-1 disease in vivo, and provide an opportunity to dissect viral genetic contributions to pathogenesis, while controlling for host genetic factors and environmental variables. We have recently sequenced a collection of low-passage clinical isolates of HSV-1 and categorized each isolate according to its reproducible virulence phenotype in a mouse ocular model of infection. We measured virulence in this model by the virus' ability to infect, replicate, and induce lethal disease, which involved the virus initiating infection at the ocular surface, migrating to the peripheral nervous system (trigeminal ganglia), and even penetrating into the central nervous system (CNS). Using multiple statistical approaches, we found two loci in the viral tegument protein VP22 (UL49) that predictably distinguish high-virulence clinical isolates from low-virulence isolates. VP22 is a viral tegument protein that is conserved among alpha-herpesviruses, which functions as a hub of viral and cellular protein interactions. VP22 functions in close concert with the viral transactivator protein VP16 (UL48), and the viral RNAse VHS (UL41). The variant loci detected in association with murine virulence exist at a frequency of approximately 50% in the clinical HSV-1 isolates we have surveyed to date, suggesting that knowledge gleaned from these experiments will provide data on viral variants of relevance to ongoing trials for antivirals and vaccines. With increased power from additional genotype-phenotype data, we will use a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to measure the association of VP22 and other candidate loci with virulence in HSV-1. We will make recombinant HSV-1 strains to test the role(s) of VP22 and other candidate virulence loci both in vivo and in vitro. We will test the hypothesis that virulent and non-virulent phenotypes in vivo result from distinct biochemical differences in VP22 between these isolates. Data from these experiments will enable us to test the robustness of our forward genetic predictions of virulence loci in HSV-1. If these data can be linked to human impacts in the future, the ability to gauge likely virulence level based on viral genotype would provide a powerful tool for future diagnostics and prediction of clinical outcomes.\",\n",
       " 'Interferon (IFN) induction and signaling is an early antiviral response that can be triggered by viral double- stranded (ds)RNA. While critical to limiting viral replication and spread, overexpression of the IFN response can be detrimental to human health. For example, Aicardi-GoutiÃ©res syndrome (AGS) is a severe autoimmune, neurodevelopmental and inflammatory disease, caused by mutation of any of several genes involved in IFN production and signaling, characterized by excessive IFN (primarily IFN-?) production and signaling in the absence of virus infection. Mutation of the ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) gene is one cause of AGS. ADAR1 destabilizes dsRNA, and mutations in the ADAR1 gene lead to accumulation of endogenous self-dsRNA and as a consequence chronic induction of IFN and other cytokines, leading to cell death and damage primarily to the central nervous system (CNS) and the skin. Studies in mouse models have shown that Adar1 knockout (KO) is embryonic lethal and can be rescued by KO of genes encoding proteins involved in IFN production (MDA5 or MAVS). However the downstream activities mediating lethality have not been identified nor have the pathological effects of Adar1 KO in the CNS been addressed in these mouse model systems. Thus, there is a gap in our understanding of where the IFN is generated, in the periphery and/or the CNS and in which cell types and how IFN signaling promotes CNS pathology. We recently found that the potent antiviral oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-ribonuclease (RNase) L pathway is induced by self-dsRNA in the absence of ADAR1 in uninfected human lung epithelial derived A549 cells and importantly that activation of RNase L is a dominant pathway leading to cell death. Moreover, we found that ADAR1 KO is also lethal in A549 cells and that lethality can be rescued by KO of RNase L or by MAVS. These data suggest that RNase L activity may play a role in promoting cell death and CNS damage in AGS patients and/or in mouse models. We will utilize our expertise in IFN response during neurotropic coronavirus infection in a mouse model and our recent findings on endogenous dsRNA induction of RNase L in human A549 cells to test the following hypothesis : In the absence of Adar1 gene expression, endogenous dsRNA induces IFN in the periphery and/or in the CNS, leading to an IFN signaling response and activation of RNase L resulting in cell death and CNS pathology. We will use a novel approach centered on tamoxifen inducible Adar1 KO in Adar1fl/flERT2Cre mice and cell type specific Adar1 KO mice to ablate Adar1 expression in vitro in primary CNS cell cultures and in vivo in mice. We will 1) compare cytokine production, RNase L activation and cell death in primary murine CNS cells as well as myeloid cells following Adar1 ablation in vitro and 2) investigate the role of the blood brain barrier and the cell type specific role of ADAR1 in controlling CNS pathogenesis in vivo. These findings will contribute toward understanding the impact of endogenous dsRNA in promoting CNS pathology and in the long term will aid in identifying targets for therapy of AGS.',\n",
       " 'Access to biological samples is crucial to the research process that leads to diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines to address new and reemerging infectious diseases. However, access to biological samples has become a barrier to research. With respect to researchers based in the U.S. alone, a series of legal agreements reached at the international level erect barriers to access for viruses including Ebola, influenza, and Zika. With respect to international research collaborations, material transfer agreements are becoming more complex and increasingly necessitate the involvement of investigators. Despite these changes, a distinction remains between the role of researchers and the role of lawyers who negotiate MTAs. This conference idea arose based on the importance of minimizing barriers to access of biological samples and related knowledge from genetic resources originating in developing countries. Most researchers have little or no involvement with the material transfer process even though their interests are at stake. The fact that the material transfer process has become more integral and high-stakes in the process leading to diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines to address new and reemerging infectious diseases is reason to create this multidisciplinary meeting. This meeting has 5 overall objectives: (1) Gather infectious disease specialists with experts in the ethics and law of biological sampling, biobanking, and material transfer, (2) Develop multidisciplinary research as a vehicle to advance understanding of the changing role of the material transfer agreement especially as affected by the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization, (3) Provide opportunities to seed multidisciplinary collaborations among investigators, trainees, ethicists, and legal scholars, (4) Support trainee education about challenges arising from material transfer agreements and the role of investigators in addressing those challenges, and (5) Catalyze new dialogues on the structure of international scientific collaborations in light of constraints imposed by the ethics and law of sampling, biobanking, and transfer. The conference organizers include: Dr. Rebecca Katz who has had experience at multiple levels of national and international conferences including organizing meetings related to the International Health Regulations, Ebola response and pandemic preparedness in Geneva, Washington, DC and Wilton Park, UK. Professor Sam Halabi has previous experience organizing programs for one-week intensive programs aimed at multidisciplinary participants from developed and developing countries as well as many local conferences. There are few if any conferences that have attempted to bring together expertise in medicine/science, law, and ethics around the issue of material transfer as it has changed in the last decade. Without a meeting of this nature, the targeted groups of researchers would have a low likelihood of developing collaborations. This conference will act as an enzyme to catalyze those interactions in order to advance science and access to new diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.',\n",
       " 'Liver disease is currently the most common cause of non-AIDS morbidity and mortality in developed countries amongst HIV infected people. Indeed, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is more prevalent during HIV infection compared to the uninfected population occurring in 30-40% of HIV-infected individuals. Critically, fatty liver disease is becoming an increasingly recognized precursor to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can further develop into cirrhosis and liver failure. Progression toward NAFLD and steatohepatitis is multifactorial, and includes metabolic changes, cytokine release associated with TLR stimulation and oxidative stress. With regards to HIV infection, the precise drivers and mechanisms of liver disease are not well defined. This proposal will utilize the pathogenic SIV infection of rhesus macaques and in vitro human cell cultures to delineate the early mediators that drive liver disease during SIV/HIV infection. Our previous study assessing livers from SIV-infected and SIV-infected-cART-treated macaques (assessed at necropsy) identified increased levels of bacterial 16s DNA in the livers of both groups. Importantly, an unexpected finding from this study was the enrichment of Mycobacterial 16s DNA in the liver of infected macaques, which we have subsequently identified as Mycobacteria smegmatis, a commensal or potentially opportunistic pathogen. These data, as well as published findings, have led to the hypothesis that translocation of bacteria and bacterial products to the liver (including Mycobacteria-associated dysbiosis) are key mediators of liver inflammation during cART-treated HIV/SIV-infection and can initiate the early events that trigger fatty liver disease. This hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims the first two Aims assess immune and microbiome changes within the liver, lymph node and blood in SIV-infected-cART-treated macaques. Aim 3 will evaluate the mechanisms underlying changes observed in human macrophages or hepatocytes utilizing in vitro experiments following exposure to HIV, cART and bacteria/PAMPs. Our goal is to delineate the role of bacterial translocation and microbiome dysbiosis in HIV/SIV-associated liver inflammation, with particular focus on mycobacteria. To undertake these aims, this study will be led by Dr. Sodora, who has 18 years of experience evaluating immune inflammation during HIV/SIV disease including previous studies assessing liver inflammation during SIV-infection and cART-treatment. In addition, the team consists of Drs. Burwitz, Sacha and Smedley at the Oregon National Primate Research Center who have the necessary expertise to successfully undertake the outlined experiments. Collectively, these approaches will allow us to undertake a mechanistic assessment of the precise contributions of HIV/SIV virus, cART drugs and gut-derived microbes in liver inflammation as well as identify potential synergistic effects of these mediators when combined in a macaque or in vitro. Our long-term goal is to identify an immune therapeutic strategy to reduce incidence and/or severity of liver disease in HIV-infected and cART-treated individuals.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This is an application for a VA Rehabilitation Research and Development (RR&D) Small Projects in Rehabilitation Research (SPiRE) Award submitted by Blake K. Scanlon, Ph.D. He is currently a Clinical Research Associate (Assistant Professor equivalent) at the Stanford/VA Aging Clinical Research Center with a pending 8/8ths VA appointment subsequent to receipt of a RR&D CDA-2 (Dementia caregiver rehabilitation: enhancing Veteran and family-centered care, 1 IK2 RX001240-01A1; JIT process complete, start date pending). Dr. Scanlon is establishing himself as a clinician-scientist who conducts patient- and family-centered clinical research on dementia and neurodegenerative disease. This award will provide Dr. Scanlon and his team with the resources necessary to develop a novel project aiming to expand the reach of the CDA-2 intervention study by utilizing mobile media devices (i.e., tablets) to serve additional family caregivers of Veterans with dementia in the comfort of their own homes. To accomplish this goal, he has gathered a team that includes three Co-Investigators: Dr. Jerome Yesavage (a geriatric psychiatrist and renowned expert in cognitive and psychiatric functioning across the lifespan); Dr. Joy Taylor (a cognitive psychologist and expert in the trajectory of cognitive decline); and Dr. Lisa Kinoshita (a clinical neuropsychologist with expertise in the assessment and treatment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in dementia); a Senior Researcher: Dr. Mary Mittelman (an internationally renowned expert in dementia caregiver intervention) and a consultant: Dr. Booil Jo (a biostatistician with expertise in design/analysis of clinical trials, longitudinal data analysis, and missing data analysis). The proposed project studies the effects of an education and skill-building rehabilitation (ESBR) intervention, designed to be low-cost and clinically scalable using mobile media devices, on family caregivers of Veterans with dementia. A total of 40 caregivers caring for a Veteran with dementia will be randomized to mobile media ESBR intervention (ESBR-m; n=20) or to usual care plus paper educational materials (UC; n=20). Intervention effects will be examined at three months post-intervention. The Primary Aim of this study is to establish the feasibility of delivering a group-based intervention to family caregivers of Veterans through mobile media devices (e.g., tablets such as the iPad). Dr. Scanlon will also use advanced statistical techniques (e.g., mixed-effects modeling) to evaluate the impact of the intervention on: quality of life (Specific Aim 1); perceive stress and depressive symptoms (Specific Aim 2); and socialization and engagement in pleasant activities (Specific Aim 3) in caregivers of Veterans with dementia. This award will create an ideal environment where Dr. Scanlon and his team can establish the necessary pilot data to pioneer the development of low-cost, pragmatic and clinically translatable methods for improving rehabilitation and management of neurodegenerative disease and dementia within VHA.',\n",
       " 'Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest public health threats worldwide. The development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens is largely driven by inappropriate antimicrobial use. Current reports state that over 50% of antimicrobial use in hospitals and up to 70% in long-term care facilities is potentially inappropriate. Recognizing the urgency of this national crisis, President Obama issued an executive order in September 2014, mandating the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs (AMS) nationally, and specifically noting that ?all VA healthcare settings, including long-term care facilities? will be involved. Unfortunately, this process of developing AMS in VA Community Living Centers has lagged behind those in acute-care facilities and little is known about the degree of antibiotic resistance and the types of stewardship interventions that might work in these facilities. Antimicrobial stewardship promotes the appropriate use of antimicrobials in order to improve patient safety and to decrease adverse events related to inappropriate antimicrobial use. Improving antimicrobial use in acute-care facilities is a critical focus of The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), as evidenced by the recent VHA Directive 1031. This policy charges every Veterans Affairs (VA) acute care facility to develop and implement an antimicrobial stewardship program led by champion physicians and pharmacists. This VHA Directive does not currently require the implentation of antimicrobial stewardship activities within nursing homes. In 2013, the VHA provided care to over 100,000 veterans in nursing homes. This proposal brings together a cadre of VA experts in the fields of long term care quality improvement, infectious diseases, geriatrics, and antibiotic stewardship (MDs, PharmDs, PhD) to directly address this timely area of study. In direct response to an HSRD priority area for research involving long term care, the overall goals of this 4 year mixed methods merit proposal are to determine the scope of antimicrobial resistance among VA CLCs, to compare that information with antimicrobial utilization patterns in CLCs and proximal VAMCs, and to develop effective antimicrobial stewardship strategies tailored for the long term care environment. We hypothesize that resistance patterns and antibiotic use for CLCs will vary significantly and will be different from those observed in proximal acute care facilities. Furthermore, we hypothesize that comprehensive interdisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship programs will have the capacity to reduce selection for drug-resistant pathogens for the CLC, minimize transmission of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among patients, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes provided that they are tailored to the unique barriers that long term care entails. The specific aims of this study are: 1) Measure antimicrobial use and resistance in VA-CLCs nationally through the development of a longitudinal database of antimicrobial use and resistance. This database would allow us to quantify regional and temporal trends, and identify areas of high antimicrobial use and resistance nationally, 2) Develop and implement various well researched antimicrobial stewardship practices and programs at three CLCs, 3) Measure Antimicrobial Stewardship interventions on resistance, antimicrobial use and outcomes data from pilot CLCs.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare: Decision support, surveillance, and quality care initiatives have incredible potential to increase the health of veterans. The rich clinical data contained in the electronic health record enables development of these applications; however, much of that data is locked in free-text reports and remains inaccessible to computerized applications. Natural language processing (NLP) can be applied to provide structured output from free-text input. The VA has been at the forefront of developing NLP techniques within the VHA.  Background: A new generation of tools is needed to realize the vision of effective use and analysis of free-text clinical records for both improving care quality and informing clinical research. Clinical natural language  processing tools have been developed for classifying, extracting, and summarizing information from narrative  clinical texts, in support of diverse tasks including the identification of patients with nosocomial infections,  phenotype-genotype correlation, and selection of patient cohorts for research studies. The VA has been a leader in developing NLP capability, with the hope of implementing NLP in system-facing, patient-facing, and team-facing applications being developed in hi2 HMP and iEHR. Many NLP tools and components are already being developed and hosted on Veteran's Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) (Project 1).  Unfortunately, a large gap between development and clinical/research practice limits applicability-most  applications require customization of NLP tools to specific domains, NLP tasks often require the combination of  multiple (often incompatible) tools, and there is a need to integrate external displays to aid interpretation.  Advances in human-computer interaction and information visualization suggest approaches that can help overcome many of these limitations. A growing body of experience with interactive visualizations of clinical data provides multiple models of how abstracted information from clinical records might best be displayed to users, while extensive experience in fields such as end-user programming and user-centered design provides guidance on how some of the shortcomings in clinical NLP application might be addressed.  Objective: We envision a flexible, user-centered development environment that will provide VA clinicians and medical researchers with the ability to customize and configure NLP and visualization components with little or no NLP-specific expertise or custom software development. As shown in Figure 1, we will build upon a solid  foundation of successful VA NLP components (Project 1) developed largely by members of this CREATE team  to realize this goal, applying user-centered design and evaluation techniques to address the gap between  existing NLP technology and the needs of end users (providers and researchers in projects 3 and 4). The resulting development environment will allow non-NLP experts to customize, investigate, and apply NLP to clinical tasks and to develop visual interfaces that integrate and display EHR data.  Methods: Consistent with the entire INFORMED CREATE, our approach is a user-centered approach in which the data needs of users are considered in the context of their clinical workflow. Users for this project are researchers and providers in Projects 3 and 4 seeking to develop applications for extracting, analyzing, and displaying structured and unstructured data from the EHR. The development environment will be a general-purpose toolkit for researchers developing diverse types of displays for many different domains.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Heart attack and stroke, which together are called cardiovascular disease, cause over 1/3 of all deaths in VA patients. The current guidelines for the prevention of these conditions focus on lowering patients' blood pressure and cholesterol levels. A new treatment strategy, which I call benefit-based tailored treatment, that instead guides treatment decisions based on the likelihood that a medication would prevent a heart attack or stroke could prevent more cardiovascular disease, with lower medication use, and be more patient centered. The purpose of this Career Development Award is to develop and assess tools and approaches that could enable the implementation of benefit-based tailored treatment of cardiovascular disease, in particular a decision support tool and educational program for clinicians and a performance profiling system. The decision support tool will enable better care by showing clinicians patient-specific estimates of the likelihood that their medication decisions will prevent a cardiovascular disease event. The performance profiling system will encourage better care by assessing the quality of care provided at VA sites and in PACT teams based on how well the medical care provided follows this treatment strategy. The project will have three aims. Aim 1: In the first aim, I will seek to understand clinicians' and patients' perceptions of and receptivity to the use of benefit-based tailored treatment for cardiovascular disease. Information gained from qualitative research with clinicians will help assess and improve the usability and effectiveness of the decision support tool and educational program for clinicians, along with the acceptability of the treatment strategies in general. Information gained from focus groups with patients will help learn their priorities in cardiovascular disease prevention, to help identify ways to make the interventions and their assessments more patient-centered. Aim 2: In the second aim, the decision support tool and educational program will be assessed in a real-world randomized pilot study involving thirty clinicians. Half of the clinicians will be provided the decision support tool and education intervention for ten patients each, the other half will receive a traditional quality improvement program and treatment reminders. The study will have formative goals of ensuring that clinicians and patients believe the tool is valuable and does not disrupt care processes or workflow for anyone in the PACT team. This will be studied with qualitative and survey assessments. The primary summative outcome will be the influence of the intervention on clinicians' treatment decisions. Secondary outcomes will assess patients' satisfaction with their visits and their clinicians. Aim 3: The third aim will develop and evaluate a novel performance measurement system based on benefit- based tailored treatment. First, the performance profiling system will be developed. Then the profiling system's ability to reliably differentiate high quality from low-quality care will be evaluated.\",\n",
       " 'Summary The 2018 meeting will be the third GRC on ?Sleep Regulation and Function?, the second Sleep GRC to include a GRS, and the first conference after we were promoted from a GRC-sponsored meeting to a continuing GRC. As in 2014 and 2016, the 2018 GRC/GRS will be held at the GRC site in Galveston TX. There are many large meetings for sleep professionals, but sleep GRC/GRS clearly meet a widely-felt need: they are the only existing small-format conference focused broadly on the latest basic sleep research, with the specific goal of fostering forward-thinking and innovative approach to sleep science. Both previous sleep GRCs scored in the highest-performing group among all GRCs held in their respective year, with >85% of respondents ranking the meetings as ?excellent? in all categories. Participation was outstanding (199 applications accepted for 2014, 233 for 2016), with 22% (2014) and 25% (2016) of attendees coming from Europe and Asia. Sleep GRCs contributed significantly to grow the next generation of sleep researchers: trainees were 30% of all attendees in 2014 and 40% in 2016. Sleep GRCs also strongly promoted diversity: women represented 44% (2014) and 49% (2016) of all attendees. We believe this success will continue in 2018. The Chair (Dr. Chiara Cirelli, U Wisconsin ? Madison), Vice-Chair (Dr. Paul Shaw, Washington U - St. Louis), and the Steering Committee of 12 eminent sleep researchers planned an outstanding program that spans the breath of the field and reaches out to outside experts, including the Keynote Speaker, Dr. Cristina Alberini (NYU) and Drs Matthew Colonnese (George Washington U) and Heiko Luhmann (U Mainz Germany). None of them has studied sleep per se, but their work on memory consolidation and on the maturation of brain activity soon after birth, when sleep is the predominant behavior, is highly relevant for many of us. The other 7 sessions will discuss the evolving roles of catecholamines in sleep/wake regulation, the cellular and systems? costs of wake for brain and body, the new paradoxes of REM sleep, the global and local determinants of sleep need, the consequences of enhancing/disrupting specific sleep rhythms, the metabolic and vascular effects of sleep disruption. These topics were specifically chosen because thought-provoking and, in line with the subtitle for the 2018 meeting, they are expected to trigger an intense debate on the ?How and Why? of sleep, with the goal of leading to new insights. In addition to including a GRS, the 2018 GRC program will strongly promote the training of young sleep researchers by including 8 early career scientists as GRC speakers or discussion leaders, and 7 trainees (graduate students and post-docs) as GRC speakers. Both Chair and Keynote speaker are women, and so are 38% of the speakers and 78% of the Discussion leaders (~33% for both in 2016). Sleep research is thriving, unraveling the specific mechanisms by which sleep benefits brain and body, from learning and memory to metabolic and cardiovascular function. We expect this meeting to be a crucial milestone that helps the field to move forward in an open-minded and innovative manner.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care: VA set an ambitious goal for ending homelessness among Veterans by 2015. HUD-VASH and Grant & Per Diem (GPD) are two primary VA housing programs to help Veterans exit homelessness. Substance abuse among Veterans in VA housing is a major risk factor for worsening psychopathology and housing instability. Despite recent adoption of a Housing First approach, many VA housing programs lack the staff infrastructure to manage substance use disorders (SUDs). This is a significant problem as 60% (conservative estimate) of Veterans in VA housing have SUDs and these Veterans show greater psychopathology compared to their counterparts without SUDs. These issues warrant substantial need for SUD programs in VA housing that are efficient to deploy, easily layered onto existing services, and require minimal staff to operate. The current study addresses this current void in VA treatment services in that it investigates the effectiveness, implementation process, and cost estimate of treatment of an adaptation of motivational interviewing, an empirically supported intervention with strong impact on reducing substance use and enhancing treatment engagement, in a group format, referred to as Group Motivational Interviewing (GMI) for Veterans with SUDs in VA housing. Data from this project, if shown to be promising, will establish the basis of a GMI dissemination and implementation course of action for highly vulnerable homeless Veterans in VA housing for achieving their greatest success in attaining housing stability. Background: There is a significant need for 'wraparound' treatment services in VA housing for addressing SUDs. Homeless Veterans with SUDs are vulnerable to treatment dropout, rendering them susceptible to relapse, while their continuation in outpatient care during their participation in VA housing leads to improved clinical outcomes. According to systematic reviews, individual MI reduces the incidence of SUD, when compared to no treatment, but is labor intensive. As VA moves toward a 'Housing First' paradigm where greater numbers of homeless Veterans will continue to use substances while in VA housing, delivery of GMI (which may be less labor intensive) to these patients will be important for initiating and maintaining their recovery as well as enhancing their psychosocial integration and quality of life. In a prior controlled trial conducted by the PI, GMI resulted in significantly higher outpatient treatment engagement and lower substance use compared to treatment-as-usual among dually diagnosed Veterans. Objectives: Study objectives are consistent with VA housing recommendations focusing on patient recovery, health services promotion, and treatment implementation evaluation. GMI will be compared to a control treatment condition (CT) on (Specific Aim I; Five outcomes: (Primary H1): treatment engagement; (Primary H1): substance use; (Secondary H2): psychosocial integration (e.g., social support, community participation); (Secondary H3) quality of life/psychiatric indices; and (Secondary H4): number of days engaging in structured/productive work activities in the 6-month follow up. Specific Aim II involves a process evaluation for documenting (A) formative (e.g., developmental), (B) process, and (C) summative outcomes; and Specific Aim III involves estimation of cost of intervention in terms of direct costs, indirect costs of staff, costs of capital and workload measures for future implementation and dissemination research. Methods: Randomized controlled trial comparing GMI to CT across five critical outcomes. 186 Veterans in VA housing services (93 per treatment arm) will be enrolled with a diagnosis of alcohol or drug abuse/dependence. Recruitment will take place in Charleston VAMC HUD-VASH & GPD. Participants will be randomly assigned to (1) GMI or (2) CT, each consisting of 4 sessions, and will be evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months. Participants with a non-substance related DSM-IV-TR major Axis I disorder (e.g., MDD, PTSD) will be eligible for the study. Analyses will be conducted using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) approach.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Anticipated Impact on Veterans' Health Care: Veterans of OEF/OIF/OND are young, increasingly female, and include growing numbers of Veterans who have survived historically mortal injuries. These patriots face unique physical and mental health challenges that may be detrimental to future fertility; challenges include: sexual assault, blast injuries causing genito-urinary trauma and traumatic brain injury, chemical exposures, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Thus comprehensive, high-quality reproductive care, including infertility prevention and treatment, is vitally important for the post-deployment health and quality of life of this generatin of Veterans. Our goal is to better identify, understand, and treat infertility and to facilitate infertility care utilization for Veterans in order to make a positive impact on post-deployment health and quality of life for affected Veterans. Background: Responding to increased pressure from Veteran advocates and a Senate bill from December 2012, the VA recently renewed efforts to provide limited infertility care to Veterans. Very little is known about the true prevalence of infertility in Veterans, especially in the male population, or the impact of combat-related and sexual assault trauma on fertility, much less the existing disparities, barriers, and preferences regarding infertility care in the VA system. The Pentagon is monitoring the number of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans who have suffered pelvic or genital injuries that could impact reproductive capability, and traumatic injury benefits are now being paid to those affected. Sexual assault is an even more common trauma in female Veterans and a relatively overlooked issue for male Veterans; officials estimate that 26,000 military members were sexually assaulted in 2012 alone (up 35% from the previous year). Our team's study of 1,004 female Veterans suggested sexual assault is also a risk factor for infertility as well as for delay and avoidance o pregnancy. Other studies indicate duration of deployment, concurrent mental health diagnoses, and traumatic brain injury can also increase the risk of infertility in Veterans. Specific Aims: 1.  Assess infertility prevalence in a nationally representative sample of reproductive-aged male and female OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. 2. Compare prevalence of infertility in those who have and have not experienced sexual and/or combat-related trauma and quantitatively investigate how physical and psychological injury and biological and behavioral alternations mediate risk of infertility due to these traumas. 3. Use qualitative methods to further elucidate associations between trauma exposures and infertility, identify unexpected connections, and explore Veteran-identified best opportunities for VA intervention. Methods: Guided by a novel conceptual framework, we will use an explanatory mixed methods design: subject selection model for this study. To begin, quantitative data will be collected using computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) with nationally representative samples of male and female OEF/OIF/OND Veterans <45 years old in order to determine the prevalence of infertility. Associations between sexual assault and combat- related trauma and infertility will then be estimated using accelerated failure time and logistic regression models. Next we will qualitatively examine infertile Veterans unique experiences, exploring the complex relationships between trauma exposures, fertility outcomes and infertility care seeking. Data will be collected using semi-structured telephone interviews with a purposeful sampling of subjects identified as infertile in the CATI. This qualitative study phase will ensure that all relevant associations are analyzed in the quantitative analysis and will also extend our knowledge of Veteran preferences for infertility-related health services. Our conceptual framework will help integrate the quantitative and qualitative components coherently while emerging itself as an improved framework to guide next step interventions.\",\n",
       " 'Project Background/Rationale: Antimicrobial stewardship as a means to combat the spread of antibiotic- resistant bacteria has become a national priority, both within and outside the VHA. This IIR project focuses on improving Veteran safety by reducing inappropriate use of antimicrobials for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), a very common condition that leads to antimicrobial overuse in acute and long-term care. We conducted a successful intervention to decrease guideline-discordant ordering of urine cultures and antibiotics for ASB. This single site intervention, entitled ?Kicking Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI): the No Knee- Jerk Antibiotics Campaign,? reduced unnecessary screening for ASB by 71% and unnecessary treatment of ASB by 75% in a large and complex VA medical center. The UTI medication use evaluation recently conducted by the VA Antimicrobial Stewardship Task Force (ASTF) shows an acute need for our intervention, as 57% of 1,219 urine cultures treated as UTI (with antibiotics) were actually ASB. Our work is innovative in that we address the cognitive biases that drive overuse of antibiotics and encourage more deliberate choice. Project Objectives: The objective of this project is to facilitate implementation of a scalable version of the Kicking CAUTI campaign across four geographically diverse VA facilities while assessing what aspects of an antimicrobial stewardship intervention are essential to success and sustainability. Our project team and our operational partners will provide expertise and external facilitation, while intervention implementation at the facility level will be performed by the local personnel tasked with antimicrobial stewardship. The two main intervention tools are (1) an evidence-based algorithm that distills the guidelines into a streamlined clinical pathway, and (2) case-based audit and feedback to train clinicians to use the algorithm. The intervention is directed at providers in acute and long-term care, and the goal is to reduce inappropriate screening for and treatment of ASB in all patients and residents, not just those with urinary catheters. Aim 1 is to determine barriers to guideline-recommended practices for management of catheter-associated bacteriuria at intervention sites and assemble the local implementation teams. Aim 2 is to implement and evaluate a scalable version of the Kicking CAUTI intervention in four VA facilities, using four additional sites as contemporaneous controls. 2a: We will measure the clinical outcomes of urine cultures ordered, antibiotic use, and episodes of Clostridium difficile infection using Corporate Data Warehouse and review of selected charts at each site. 2b: We will study the relationship between the dose of the intervention delivered and clinical outcomes. Aim 3: Assess the economic implications of the intervention through a budget impact analysis. Methods: Our intervention will include an on-ramp period for each facility consisting of centrally-led phone calls with local site champions and baseline surveys. Case-based audit and feedback will begin at a given site after the on-ramp period and continue for twelve months. We will stagger intervention roll-out by quarter for each of the four intervention sites. The three-year project timeframe allows 3 months for project start-up, 3 months on-ramp at each site, 12 months for the active intervention implementation, and a sustainability phase at each site. Our analysis for Aim 2A will use clinical outcome data from Corporate Data Warehouse to conduct interrupted time series with segmented regression analysis. The analysis for Aim 2B will use regression models to assess whether more complete implementation is associated with better clinical outcomes, using process measures of key implementation components. The budget impact analysis will assess savings and costs of the intervention from the VHA perspective. Throughout the project we will have two calls each year with our operational partners. These partners, the National Center for Patient Safety, the National Infectious Diseases Service, the ASTF, and Pharmacy Benefits Management, have advised and directed the design of this proposal over the past year and will continue their involvement from the time of project launch to help plan for national dissemination.',\n",
       " 'Physical activity (PA) has numerous and profound benefits on health and function, yet there is limited knowledge of the mechanistic signals that underlie these benefits. Such knowledge is critical for optimizing the effective use of PA as a preventive or therapeutic intervention strategy for specific diseases and in specific populations. The overarching goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to address this knowledge gap by characterizing the molecular responses to PA. This will be accomplished through the collection of blood and tissue samples from both humans and animals, which will then be subjected to extensive ?Omics? analyses. By generating a comprehensive map of molecular responses to PA, MoTrPAC will lay the foundation for a new era of biomedical research on Precision Exercise Medicine. The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC) is exceptionally well poised to lead a MoTrPAC Adult Clinical Center and to contribute to all Consortium activities. Our investigators and collaborators have extensive experience with complex clinical PA intervention trials, including tissue sampling, in cohorts spanning the entire adult age spectrum. Our expertise extends across multiple physiological systems, diseases, and health conditions, and includes broad proficiency in physiologic, metabolic, and morphometric phenotyping. The facilities at CU-AMC for MoTrPAC activities are outstanding. The proposed MoTrPAC ? Colorado Clinical Center will accomplish the following Specific Aims (SA): SA1: Contribute to, and lead when appropriate, all MoTrPAC Phase 1 planning activities (Year 1) described in RFA-RM-15-015 through participation on the MoTrPAC Steering Committee and Subcomittees. The local goals for Phase 1 will be to accomplish tasks (e.g., obtain regulatory approvals, train staff) that will enable Phase 2 to start at the beginning of Year 2. SA2: Recruit and enroll 450 adults at CU-AMC (or the number determined during Phase 1), conduct the acute PA tests and PA intervention according to protocols established by the Consortium, and carry out all other MoTrPAC Phase 2 activities (Years 2 to 5). Highly accomplished clinical investigators will lead the seven ?teams? that will be responsible for: recruitment, screening, and retention; physiologic, metabolic, and morphometric phenotyping; biospecimen acquisition; biospecimen processing; acute PA tests; chronic PA interventions; and data management and quality assurance. SA3: As animal and human data become available from the Chemical Analysis Sites and Bioinformatics Center, we will participate in all Phase 3 activities, including data analysis, preparation of manuscripts, and dissemination of results. These activities will be guided by the MoTrPAC Steering Committee and Subcommittees. On the local level, we will host an annual 1-day local symposium on PA, Health, and Fitness to catalyze the interest of investigators at CU-AMC and other nearby academic institutions in MoTrPAC.',\n",
       " 'A Pediatric Clinical Center for Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity (MoTrPAC): Towards a Molecular Map of Exercise in the Pediatric Origins of Health Across the Lifespan The goals of this research are to: 1) map the molecular mechanisms through which exercise benefits health in children and adolescents, a critical period of change in the human phenotype, and 2) provide the MoTrPAC consortium with rigorously collected and reproducible data from exercise studies in children and adolescents. This proposal is based on exciting discoveries in a range of disciplines, including: 1) new insights into age- dependent progression of gene expression during growth in children, 2) emerging data highlighting the central role played by leukocytes (n.b., an accessible tissue in child health research) in transducing exercise into health benefits, 3) pilot data showing remarkable interaction between the molecular transducers of growth and the molecular transducers of exercise, and 4) novel approaches to measuring and understanding physiologic and morphometric responses to acute and chronic exercise in children. In the proposed acute exercise studies, the immediate physiologic, proteomic, metabolomic, and leukocyte function and transcriptomic response to a brief exercise-induced perturbation in cellular homeostasis will be measured in a cross section of early- and late-pubertal boys and girls. In the proposed chronic exercise studies (a 12-week, prospective, aerobic exercise training intervention), we will compare the magnitude of the biomarker and molecular adaptation to training, along with the accompanying morphometric and physiologic changes between early- and late-pubertal girls and boys. The combined data from the acute and chronic exercise studies will be analyzed with systems- computational techniques to map the networks that transduce physical activity to health in the growing child and adolescent. Because phenotype is a ?moving target? during growth, we will use accurate methodologies (such as DXA for body composition and breath-by-breath gas exchange for cardiopulmonary exercise testing) that have proven in our hands to be feasible in large numbers of children and adolescents. Traditional exercise testing will be complemented by laboratory-based ?real-life? exercise protocols, and in all cases, scaled to each participant?s physical fitness, estimates of habitual physical activity, noninvasive measures of vascular health, and training volume and mode. In this way, the pediatric and adult data will be readily integrated. As an academic health center unit devoted uniquely to the study of physical activity and health in children in a very diverse region, our group is exceptionally qualified to contribute to the MoTrPAC consortium. We 1) published a series of discoveries of novel genomic and epigenetic exercise biomarkers in circulating leukocytes in both children and adults, 2) performed thousands of pediatric exercise tests, 3) conducted many successful prospective exercise training interventions in early and late pubertal children, and 4) were leaders in Project HEALTHY, the large NIH multicenter study to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes in children, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This research will ultimately enable child health professionals, families, and community leaders to optimize the use of exercise to promote health during a critical period of growth.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vagus nerve is a major conduit between lung and brain required for normal respiration. Within the airways, vagal sensory neurons detect mechanical stretch of the lung during tidal breathing, cues associated with inflammation and illness, and irritants that in some species evoke cough. However, molecular mechanisms by which vagal sensory neurons detect and encode respiratory stimuli remain poorly understood. In preliminary data, we used a molecular and genetic approach to classify sensory afferents in the airways, and adapted genetic tools to map, image, ablate, and functionally control vagal sensory neurons. We genetically tagged two sparse populations of vagal afferents (P2RY1, NPY2R) that exert powerful and opposing effects on breathing (Cell, 2015). P2RY1 neurons are largely fast-conducting a fibers that innervate clusters of pulmonary endocrine cells termed neuroepithelial bodies. Optogenetic stimulation of vagal P2RY1 neurons stops breathing, trapping animals in exhalation, without acutely impacting heart rate or gastric pressure, which are also under vagal control. NPY2R neurons are largely capsaicin-responsive C fibers, and optogenetic activation of vagal NPY2R neurons causes rapid and shallow breathing. Based on these results, we hypothesize that vagal P2RY1 neurons mediate the Hering-Breuer inspiratory reflex, while vagal NPY2R neurons are involved in pulmonary defense. These findings raise basic questions regarding the sensory stimuli in the airways that activate P2RY1 and NPY2R neurons, whether these neurons are required for normal respiration, and how these neurons sense and transduce airway cues. We will use P2ry1-ires-Cre and Npy2r-ires-Cre mice, and genetic approaches for in vivo imaging, neuron ablation, and cell-specific gene knockout to probe the sensory biology of vagal P2RY1 and NPY2R neurons. In Aim 1, we developed a new in vivo imaging paradigm in vagal ganglia that involves a genetically encoded calcium indicator, and will use this technique to query the specific response properties of vagal P2RY1 and NPY2R neurons. In Aim 2, we will selectively eliminate P2RY1 and NPY2R neurons by controlled diphtheria toxin-mediated cell ablation and determine the impact on respiratory physiology. In Aim 3, we will explore the roles of particular cell surface receptors in vagal afferents using knockout mice that lack Piezo2 or P2RY1 in some or all vagal sensory neurons. Piezo2 is abundantly expressed in a cohort of airway- innervating sensory neurons, and is a prime candidate to mediate an aspect of airway mechanosensation. Together, these studies should provide insights into cellular mechanisms underlying activation and modulation of breathing control pathways by peripheral cues. Understanding the sensory biology of respiratory control neurons in the vagus nerve may provide therapeutic targets for airway disease intervention.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY - PROJECT 2 The central goal of Project 2 is to understand the various roles of alternative splicing in cancer, and to exploit cancer-specific features of this process to develop targeted-therapeutic approaches. Cancer cells display extensive qualitative and quantitative dysregulation of splicing, and a subset of the numerous isoforms that are inappropriately expressed contribute to tumorigenesis or altered cell metabolism. The mechanisms and pathways through which the splicing-factor oncoproteins SRSF2 and SRSF1 transform cells will continue to be investigated. Cell-culture models, as well as orthotopic and genetic mouse models will be used to study tumorigenesis promoted by these splicing factors upon mutation or overexpression in different cancer contexts, with an emphasis on recurrent mutations in myeloid dysplasias. High-throughput RNA-sequencing and computational analysis will be employed to identify and compare the splicing targets of these SR proteins in different cancer contexts, and selected targets will be characterized and manipulated to evaluate their contributions to tumorigenesis and potential as therapeutic targets or biomarkers. One key event, alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase pre-mRNA, which controls the distinctive glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells, will be thoroughly investigated as a potential therapeutic target, by specifically manipulating this process in vivo, using antisense technology and mouse models of glioma and hepatocellular carcinoma.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY - PROJECT 3 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a large and relatively understudied class of RNAs that have great potential to provide novel opportunities to influence gene regulation and cancer biology. The long-term goal of Project 3 is to identify lncRNAs that are over-expressed in breast cancer, define their role in the disease, and develop approaches to manipulate their expression in vivo to impact breast cancer progression. Here, a series of Aims are presented to determine the roles of Malat1 lncRNA, and several recently identified lncRNAs - Mammary Tumor Associated RNAs (MaTARs) - that are expressed in mouse models of luminal B and Her2/neu mammary cancer. We showed that Malat1 is over-expressed in mammary tumors and its genetic loss or knockdown results in differentiation of the primary tumor and a significant reduction in metastasis. Studies are proposed to identify the steps in metastasis that are dependent upon Malat1 and the critical regions of the RNA contributing to its function. Mouse models containing GFP- or bioluminescently-labeled breast tumor cells will be used to follow metastasis and in vivo antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) knockdown will provide a means to reveal the specific dependencies of Malat1 in the metastatic process. 3D tumor organoid cultures will be used to ascertain functional domains within Malat1 and to identify critical regions that are essential for tumorigenesis. The promoters of mammary tumor genes that are impacted upon Malat1 knockdown are enriched in Sox5 and Tcfcp2l1 binding sites. Studies are proposed to examine the role of these transcription factors, in conjunction with Malat1, to regulate the differentiation of primary tumors and the significant reduction in metastasis upon Malat1 knockdown. A series of studies are proposed to determine the function of 4 recently identified MaTARs that are expressed in a mammary tumor-specific manner. Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP) coupled to deep sequencing or mass spectrometry will be used to identify interacting DNA sequences and proteins. To evaluate the potential of these MaTARs as therapeutic targets genetic knockout mouse models will be established and crossed with mammary tumor models to assess the impact on tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. RNA-seq will be performed on knockout and wild-type tumors to identify global gene expression changes upon MaTAR loss. The expression level and breast cancer sub-type specificity of human MaTAR orthologs has been examined and will be correlated with overall and relapse-free survival, and metastatic incidence, and appropriate candidates will be studied in patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Together, the proposed studies will define the role of several lncRNAs in breast cancer biology, and determine their potential as therapeutic targets to impact breast cancer progression.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Damage to the genetic material of our cells can have many undesired consequences. It may lead to cell death, growth arrest, inappropriate growth or mutations. The outcomes of these on the organismal levels are failure of essential organ function or cancer. Rare human genetic diseases have enlightened us about how lack of DNA repair and thus persistence of DNA damage in our cells leads to these problems. Our laboratory studies two DNA repair diseases, Fanconi anemia (FA) and Karyomegalic Interstitial Nephritis (KIN). Patients with FA have developmental abnormalities including skeletal anomalies and bone marrow failure, which leaves them unable to produce enough red blood cells to carry oxygen, platelets to prevent bleeding or white blood cells to fight off infections. FA patients als have a very high predisposition to developing cancer including acute myelogenous anemia that occurs paradoxically in the setting of the bone marrow failure, head and neck cancers, and gynecologic cancers. KIN patients develop kidney failure and need dialysis and kidney transplantation. Although rare, these diseases can be used as powerful models for understanding how bone marrow and kidneys fail, and how cancer develops when the DNA is not repaired. We strive to understand the molecular underpinnings of these diseases, connections and differences between them. Even though the patients with the two diseases show different health problems, the cells from the patients lack the ability to repair a very particular type of DNA damage, interstrand crosslink, which links the two strands of DNA together precluding their separation. This kind of damage may be caused by environmental toxins, metabolites from cellular processes or by chemotherapy during cancer treatment. In this grant, we propose to concentrate our attention on the nucleases involved in processing of the interstrand crosslinks. We have identified SLX4 mutations in three patients with Fanconi anemia in the International Fanconi anemia registry. With our collaborators, we have described FAN1 mutations in KIN patients. In the first two aims we propose to use the patient cell lines to understand the pathogenesis of the two diseases. Using molecular approaches we want to understand the interaction of SLX4- bound nucleases as well as FAN1, their different requirements across cell cycle and across different DNA lesions and how they genetically interact with other DNA repair pathways in the cell. In the third aim, we will take a biochemical approach to understand these nucleases. Performing in vitro experiments, we want to study how they work on damaged DNA. Our goal is to have a detailed picture of how the cell deals with crosslinks in hopes of manipulating the repair pathways for therapeutic applications.',\n",
       " \"Gram-negative bacteria utilize extracellular fibers called chaperone-usher pathway (CUP) pili to mediate adhesion to host and environmental surfaces, facilitate invasion into host tissues, and promote interaction with other bacteria to form biofilms. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) use a CUP adhesion protein (lectin) called FimH on the type 1 pilus to bind to mannosylated glycoproteins on bladder epithelial cells to mediate the onset and progression of urinary tract infections (UTIs). This binding event initiates bacterial invasion and formation of intracellular bacterial  communities (IBCs) in the eukaryotic cell. Using rational drug design, mannoside antagonists of FimH have been developed as orally bioavailable therapeutics for the treatment and prevention of UTIs. Acute infection can either  self-resolve or develop into chronic cystitis, which is characterized by: i) persistent, high titer bacteriuria and  bacterial bladder burdens at sacrifice >4 weeks post- infection; ii) chronic inflammation and urothelial necrosis; iii) lymphonodular hyperplasia in the bladder submucosa and; iv) urothelial hyperplasia with a lack of uroplakin expression, which is a marker for terminal differentiation in superficial facet cells. Similar histological findings have been observed in humans suffering persistent bacteriuria and recurrent UTI. FmlH, the tip-associated  adhesin of Fml/F9/Yde pili (previously denoted FmlD) functions in UPEC pathogenesis by providing a fitness advantage during chronic cystitis. FmlH specifically binds to Gal(?1-3)GalNac epitopes which appear as part of  a remodeled glycan/galactose profile of the mouse bladder during chronic cystitis. FmlH is also upregulated in urines directly isolated from patients with UTI compared to expression during in vitro growth in media or normal  urine, suggesting a host-specific induction. In this proposal, innovative strategies will be taken to rationally  develop ?Gal and ?GalNAc ligands as antagonists of FmlH, alone or in combination with FimH inhibitors, as new preclinical therapeutics for treatment of acute and chronic cystitis. Using an X-ray structure of FmlH and virtual screening, new FmlH ligands, including O-nitrophenyl-?-galactoside (ONPG) were identified.  Subsequently, the X-ray structures of Gal?-1-3-GalNAc (TF) and ONPG bound to FmlH were used to design  improved FmlH ligands, with binding affinities several times higher than ONPG, as determined by an ELISA  binding assay. This structure-based design strategy will be used to optimize new ligands with higher affinity and good drug-like properties. This project's aims will be accomplished by integrating: i) X-ray structure-based drug design with medicinal chemistry (Aim 1); ii) biochemical screening, functional cell and tissue binding assays  Aim 2) and; rigorous pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation and pharmacodynamic (PD) efficacy testing of the most promising FmlH ligands, in murine animal models of chronic cystitis, urosepsis/kidney infection, and GIT colonization (Aim 3). The overall goal is to develop preclinical candidate FmlH antagonists as standalone anti-virulence therapeutics and/or as combination therapy with existing FimH antagonists for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomaterial-associated infections account for over one million nosocomial infections per year, and their prevention is a critical component to successful regenerative medicine strategies. Bacterial infection of biomaterial implants frequently results in complete removal of the implant despite aggressive antibiotic therapy. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most clinically relevant gram positive and gram negative pathogens associated with medical device failure. Bacteriophages are bacteria-specific viruses that have the ability to infect and lyse host bacteria. We have recently engineered a poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogel system for controlled delivery of therapeutic proteins that facilitates bone repair in a murine radial segmental defect model. Contamination of these hydrogels with bacteria leads to complete inhibition of bone healing, persistence of bacteria, and bone resorption. The objective of this project is to engineer PEG- based hydrogels that are infection resistant. The central hypothesis is that delivery of bacteriophage using a PEG-hydrogel will reduce infection in a mouse model for bone repair. Aim 1: Engineer hydrogels for controlled delivery of active bacteriophage to eliminate bacteria. Aim 2: Examine the ability of phage presenting hydrogels to reduce infection and improve bone repair. Aim 3: Characterize the in vivo inflammatory response to bacteriophage containing hydrogels. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on developing biomaterials that resistant infection without the use of antibiotics, thereby reducing the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria while minimizing implanted device failure. As outcomes of this research, we will establish the feasibility of controlled bacteriophage release hydrogels to reduce infection and promote bone repair. This research will establish a strategy for infection-resistant biomaterials that is applicable to various biomedical devices.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary The proposed research will develop novel methods to assess mediation and interaction between genetic and environmental exposures and different disease subtypes so as to better tailor treatments and prevention efforts to individuals' characteristics and so as to better understand the mechanisms governing disease. Methods will be developed for settings in which there are multiple disease subtypes and these disease subtypes may have different prognosis for survival and may be more amenable to different types of treatment and preventive efforts. Methodology for assessing the role of interaction in understanding mechanisms will also be developed. This will include elucidating the role of gene-environment interaction in the heritability of disease, understanding mediating pathways from exposure to disease in the presence of interaction, and identifying sufficient cause interaction for diseases or disease subtypes such that an outcome would occur if two (or more) exposures are present, but not if only one or the other were present. The methodology will be applied to understand prognosis, treatment decisions, preventive interventions, and mechanisms for colorectal cancer, and also for the development of skin lesions; the methodology will also be applied to understand the role of gene-environment interaction in the heritability of numerous traits.\",\n",
       " \"Abstract Myocardial infarction (MI) is caused by lack of adequate blood flow to the heart and results in terminal loss of cardiomyocytes (CM). MI and its related complications are a leading cause of death worldwide. The search for regenerative therapy that can repair or replace lost CM remains a daunting challenge. The foremost issue is the difficulty in procuring viable replacement cells. Heterologous sources are unattractive due to the potential for immunorejection. Harvesting progenitor cells from a patient's damaged heart is invasive and poses severe risks. Reprogramming somatic cells from other autologous sources can result in very low yields due to genetic or epigenetic barriers. A series of recent studies, however, has revealed that masseter muscle derived progenitor (MMP) cells share a common origin and have overlapping gene expression patterns with heart muscle. MMP can be isolated from highly accessible masseter muscles without mandible motor dysfunction and our preliminary data has shown that MMP yield the highest rate of CM differentiation as compared with limb muscle progenitors. Importantly, MMP can give rise to functional CM phenotypes including ventricular, atrial, and pacemaker CM under defined conditions. Therefore, MMP represent an ideal therapeutic candidate to maximize cardiogenic differentiation efficiency after cell transplantation in order to repopulate an infarcted heart region with a supply of autologous CM. At the same time, MMP avoid the common pitfalls associated with immunorejection, tumor formation, and reversion to an alternative epigenetic precursor. Aim 1 consists of in vitro studies to isolate and characterize MMP (including developmental origin, surface markers, and proliferation potential) in order to gain the desired CM population using novel sorting approaches. Aim 2 is designed to determine the mechanism by which microRNAs and transcription factor networks mediate the lineage commitments of MMP and the underlying cardiac potential of MMP as regulated by miR-128. Finally, Aim 3 focuses on the effects of implantation of MMP-derived cell sheets on the cardiac functions in mouse and porcine MI models. Experiments will examine the in vivo cell fate of MMP and determine any beneficial effects that result from cell engraftment and functional integration under ischemic conditions. These studies will provide new insights in both basic heart developmental biology and cell-based regenerative medicine. This approach holds great promise for the emerging field of personalized medicine and strongly supports the possibility that autologous MMP harvested from human masseter muscles and expanded in vitro will serve as a major source of CM that will be highly effective for treatment of patients after MI.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Historically, bacteria were either seen as pathogenic if they caused disease or benign if they lived commensally with the host. In many cases, however, single organisms have not been identified that are consistently associated with disease, but rather it is thought that bacterial community structure and bacteria- bacteria interactions differ between healthy and diseased individuals, otherwise known as dysbiosis. Naturally, investigating the microbiomes of healthy and diseased individuals using systems biology methodology could lead to insight into the processes that underlie dysbiosis. To that end, methodology has been developed to identify co-occurrence networks from microbiome data. However, to date this methodology has primarily been applied to healthy microbiome datasets and we still lack an understanding of the common properties of dysbiosis. To address these gaps, I propose to build gut microbiome co-occurrence networks for 34 immune diseases and 133 quantitative phenotypes using ~2,500 individuals from the United Kingdom Adult Twins Registry (TwinsUK), for which microbiome and phenotype data has previously been collected. First, I will identify disease-associated bacteria using generalized and linear mixed models that take into account relatedness between individuals. Next, I will use a simulation framework to compare six microbiome co- occurrence network software packages to quantify the consistency of co-occurrence networks for individuals either i) with and without disease or ii) from opposite tails of quantitative phenotype distributions. Using these networks, I will identify modules of co-occurring bacteria that are differentially abundant in disease, examine general network statistics (such as modularity and diversity), and examine the properties of disease-associated nodes as determined in Aim 1 (such as degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality). Additionally, I will take advantage of the twin relationships in our data to identify heritable network characteristics and examine co- heritability of pairs of bacteria. Finally, this will be the first study to compare these network statistics across a range of diseases in order to develop a model of how microbiome network structure differs in health and disease. Additionally, I will compare underlying network structure across phenotypes to identify diseases that share similar gut microbiome alterations. Understanding the gut microbiome at this level will be beneficial for designing therapies to target the microbiota and ultimately improve human health.',\n",
       " 'The role of Lung Surfactant (LS) in lowering the surface tension, ?, at the alveolar air-liquid interface is well known. We hypothesize that a second essential function of LS is to prevent the Laplace instability, which drives gas out of smaller alveoli and into larger ones, leading to alveolar de-recruitment, atelectasis and loss of lung compliance. These are the core symptoms of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which afflicts 150,000 people in the US with a 40% mortality rate. We hypothesize that the dynamic resistance of the LS monolayer to changes in area can reverse the Laplace instability. The dilatational modulus, ? = ? ?? ?? , relates the change in surface tension, ?, to the change in interfacial area, A. For 2??? >0, the Laplace pressure decreases with decreasing radius, suppressing the Laplace Instability. However, if 2??? < 0, variations in lung inflation drive collapse of smaller alveoli, leading to the alveolar flooding and decreased lung compliance.  Our preliminary work shows that serum proteins and lysolipids, which increase in the alveolar fluids during ARDS-induced inflammation, increase ? by competitively adsorbing to the alveolar interface. These inhibitors also dramatically decrease the dilatational modulus due to their diffusional exchange with the subphase, especially at low interfacial area strain rates (?A(t)/A). Such conditions arise in damaged areas of the lung with poor gas exchange and high levels of inflammation products and provoke the Laplace instability as 2??? < 0. This leads to further damage in injured areas of the lung and a negative feedback loop is established that may be responsible for the ineffectiveness of current ARDS treatments.  To address this hypothesis, we have built a novel capillary pressure microtensiometer to measure ?(?) of LS, serum proteins, and lysolipids for the first time. We will map out ?(?) for clinical and model lung surfactants as a function of surfactant composition, morphology, surface pressure and frequency to determine the effects of saturated vs. unsaturated lipid fraction, domain morphology, and lung surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C, cholesterol and fatty acid fractions. We will examine how ?(?) changes due to subphase compositions of lysolipids, albumin, and fibrinogen, all of which have elevated levels in the ARDS lung. These first of their kind measurements should provide us with a map of the conditions under which the Laplace instability plays a role in the progression of ARDS. Reversing the Laplace instability requires understanding how to prevent inhibitors from reaching the alveolar interface, or removing inhibitors that do adsorb. From our new understanding of ?(?) we will create LS formulations with optimized rheological properties to promote LS respreading. We also propose that minimizing the anionic lipid fraction in LS and adding low concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and trivalent cations from adjuvants such as alum, will provide an electrostatic and osmotic assist to promote LS adsorption. Minimizing the inhibitor concentration and maximizing LS would lower ?, increase ?(?) and reverse the conditions leading to the Laplace instability, thereby restoring proper lung function.',\n",
       " \"Corneal scarring from ocular trauma is a major cause of blindness in veterans, active military personnel and civilians affecting 1.5 million Americans each year. Presently, over 167,000 Veterans are legally blind, 1.5 million suffer significantly compromised vision, and >7000 veterans are becoming blind each year. The annual cost for treating blindness in America is $139 billion. Current therapies offer short-term relief, cause multiple side effects and often fails to treat preexisting corneal scars for which corneal transplant surgery is a standard of care. With current funding we have successfully identified potentially the first non-surgical therapy to cure pre-existing corneal scars in vivo, uncovered epigenetic mechanisms regulating corneal fibrosis, established novel single and 2-gene therapies to block myofibroblast formation, characterized novel TGF? DNA-binding proteins, developed a canine in vivo corneal fibrosis model, and identified many newer molecular targets, genes, and drugs to control corneal fibrosis or thinning as evident from 22 publications. Our central hypothesis is that nanoparticle-mediated gene therapy offers long-term relief from corneal blindness without significant side effects and long-term goal remains the development of innovative bench- to-bedside translational nanomedicine approaches to cure pre- and post-corneal scarring in vivo. This project tests 5 novel hypotheses formulated into 3 independent aims: 1) Tests the hypothesis that PEI2- GNPs-mediated Id3 gene (Inhibitor of differentiation) delivery into rabbit stroma will limit transdifferentiation of stromal fibroblast to myofibroblast (a key mechanism causing undesirable wound healing and fibrosis) in the cornea in vivo by disrupting the binding of E-proteins to the promoter of ?-smooth muscle actin (TGF? downstream target gene). 2) Tests 2 hypotheses that (a) PEI2-GNPs-delivered localized HGF+BMP7 gene therapy eliminates preexisting corneal scarring in vivo via mechanisms in which HGF eradicates corneal scarring by selective apoptosis in myofibroblasts and BMP7 prevents re-emergence of new wound healing due to death of established myofibroblasts by counterbalancing profibrotic Smads and (b) HGF+BMP7 delivery into stroma does not compromise characteristic collagen fibrillogenesis required for corneal clarity, maintains normal corneal homeostasis, and is safe to the eye in vivo. 3) Tests 2 novel hypotheses (a) stromal fibroblast differentiation to myofibroblast proceeds via ?-smooth muscle actin (TGF?1 downstream target gene) and is tightly controlled by the co-repressor (5'-TG-3'-interacting factor (TGIF)1, TGIF2, and SnoN) and co-activator (CBP and p300), and (b) the transdifferentiation process can be arrested by the over-expression of identified co-repressor or silencing of co-activator efficiently in vivo in a rabbit model. Successful completion of the proposed research fills critical knowledge gaps and significantly improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating corneal wound healing, lead development of novel nanomedicine approaches for corneal blindness and significantly advances the fibrosis research field.\",\n",
       " 'Genomic adaptability of the tumor cells is the major obstacle in achieving successful cancer treatment. We have studied both tumor cells and their microenvironment in multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy. The immune microenvironment in MM exhibit considerable dysfunction1. In our previous work, we showed that dysfunctional regulatory T helper cells (Tregs)2, iNKT cells3, and elevated Th17 cells and IL-17A, increase MM cell growth and survival and suppress immune responses and induce bone disease4,5. Also, by targeting IL-17A in myeloma using a human anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody (AIN457) we showed significant inhibition of MM cell growth5. However, the vast genomic changes in MM cells provide them the ability to survive and adapt to the therapeutic and immune micro-environmental influences. Our recent study has defined the mutational spectrum in MM at the time of initial diagnosis and found heterogeneity across patients6. We have recently identified biologically distinct mutations (APOBEC signature) responsible for tumor evolution and heterogeneity6. This clonal evolution is driven by a combination of factors, leads to both clonal selection and formation of new clones. We hypothesize that a combination of micro-environmental influences along with evolving genomic changes drives the tumor clone leading to progressive disease. In this regards, having studied immune status and function in previous funding period, we will now focus on identifying and validating mechanisms driving clonal changes in myeloma along with evaluation of the impact of immune microenvironment on these mechanisms. Towards this goal, we will pursue following specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify molecular markers of progression in MM by investigating mutational signatures, expression profile and APOBEC activity in paired diagnosis and relapse samples We hypothesize that continued acquisition of mutational changes, driven by specific mutational processes, underlies progression of disease in myeloma from newly-diagnosed disease to relapsed state. We will analyze genome sequencing data from archived paired MM cell samples collected at the time of diagnosis and then at relapse following initial therapy, for overall mutational spectrum, types of mutational signatures inducing mutations at diagnosis and then driving the evolution, as well as overall clonal dynamics to identify patterns associated with progression. Based on our preliminary data, we will also evaluate if APOBEC activity and expression in these samples correlates with specific genomic signatures, overall genomic instability and/or progression. Specific Aim 2: To functionally evaluate the role of APOBECs in driving genomic instability in MM. We hypothesize that dysregulated APOBEC activity may be in part responsible for acquisition of new mutational changes associated with progression in myeloma. We will therefore perform loss- and gain-of-function studies using MM cell lines to investigate immediate and long term effects on genomic integrity, ongoing genomic instability, mutational changes/signatures, genes and genomic regions affected and activation/inactivation of genome maintenance, cell cycle and apoptosis pathways, proliferation rate and ability of cells to migrate. Specific Aim 3: To investigate the impact of immune components of the BM on APOBEC activity and genomic stability in myeloma. We hypothesize, that abnormal immune components including B cell subsets and soluble factors may affect APOBEC activity and drive clonal evolution. We will evaluate the impact of B cell subsets, mature and immature DCs, Th17 cells and soluble factors including IFN-? and ?, IL-17A and IL-6 on APOBEC expression and activity, and evaluate changes in genome using our standard assays.',\n",
       " \"There are limited effective treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in the GI tract like Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The treatments that are available can have toxic side-effects and part of the barrier to developing better alternatives is that mucosal immunity remains incompletely understood. During disease, there is a breakdown in the body's natural tolerance mechanisms and that allows inflammation to progress unopposed. There is a growing body of evidence that supports a role for regulatory T cells (Tregs) in suppressing these deleterious immune responses but these cells are not fully understood and the cellular dynamics have not been explored. In this application, we propose to use functional immunoimaging to study Tregs as they modulate inflammation in the intestine and explore the role of biotin and calcium in this process. There are several additional approaches to define phenotype and functional status of the tissue and cells being studied which will supplement the imaging findings. Notably, there are no published reports on studying Tregs in this manner during colitis. The experiments have been designed to use two mouse models for colitis, an adoptive-transfer model and a spontaneous model that develops with biotin deficiency. The experiments have also been developed in such a way as to facilitate translation to the clinic. We will use two-photon microscopy which allows for real-time imaging of lymphocytes interacting in live tissue to define the cellular immunoregulatory events that explain how Tregs function to suppress colitis. In the first aim of the proposal, our studies are focused on the mesenteric lymph node to look at induction and progression of immune responses hypothesizing that Tregs physically displace pathogenic T cells from Dendritic Cells. We will also perform experiments using an S1P1 agonist which is a pharmacological agent believed to prevents effector T cells from leaving the lymph node and which may work synergistically with Tregs to prevent pathogenic T cells from reaching the colon. A similar agent has already shown promising results in clinical trials for Ulcerative Colitis. In the second aim of the proposal, our studies focus on the intestinal wall where inflammation and tissue destruction create the disease symptoms. Again, we will be focused on the role of Tregs in this process. We have seen that biotin deficient mice develop spontaneous disease that completely resolves with biotin replacement which directly links biotin to intestinal inflammation. If biotin supplementation can be shown to be effective, it would represent a low cost treatment without side-effects. Finally, the third aim focuses on how Tregs modulate calcium signaling in effector T cells in both the mesenteric lymph node and the colon. Calcium signaling is necessary for T cells to develop an immunological synapse with Dendritic Cells for activation and pathogenesis. We believe that Tregs hijack this process to induce the release of effector T cells from Dendritic Cells preventing disease. Additionally, we will study the effects of a novel therapeutic agent called an Orai1 channel blocker. Orai1 has been identified as the calcium channel in this system and we believe its blockade will also be effective in modulating immune responses in the GI tract. Furthermore, Orai1 blockade seems to have no effect of Treg function and we will examine if it can be used to augment Treg-mediated suppression of inflammation in the mesenteric lymph node and the colon. We anticipate that these three independent, but interrelated aims will enhance our understanding of the mechanism of Tregs and how they affect inflammation in the GI tract. Furthermore, we hope that the studies on the pharmacologic agents mentioned will advance their implementation for clinical use and benefit the Veterans we serve.\",\n",
       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a frequent complication of type 2 diabetes that impairs quality of life for up to 75% of men with diabetes. ED strongly correlates with insulin resistance, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the poorly understood pathogenesis of ED in diabetic and pre- diabetic states. The brain serves a key role in healthy erectile function by initiating sexual desie and by controlling autonomic erectile responses. Melanocortin pathways, consisting of POMC neurons that produce a- MSH and downstream MC3 and 4 receptor (MC4R)-containing neurons, are critical for these processes. However, therapeutics targeting MC receptors have the disadvantage of altering blood pressure and heart rate. The objective of this proposal is to determine if reduced endogenous a-MSH production can lead to ED and to identify the neuronal circuitry to which POMC neurons project to uniquely control erectile function. MC4Rs are found on oxytocin neurons to which POMC neurons project, and administration of a-MSH, MC4R agonists, or oxytocin increases sexual motivation, elicits sexual behaviors, and causes penile erection in mice and humans. The central hypothesis is that insulin and leptin resistance in POMC neurons promotes ED by reducing aMSH production and oxytocin signaling. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary data produced in the applicants' laboratories and will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Determine whether impaired insulin and leptin signaling in POMC neurons alters erectile function, 2) Determine whether restoring neuronal insulin and leptin sensitivity and a-MSH production improves sexual performance, and 3) Determine whether downstream oxytocin circuitry mediates the effects of a-MSH on erectile function. Under the first aim, novel cell type-specific tools will be used to allow acute neuronal manipulation to examine the role of POMC-specific insulin and leptin resistance in ED in a unique mouse model of prediabetes. In the second aim, the applicants will then determine whether reactivating hypothalamic leptin and insulin pathways restores normal sexual function and offers a potential treatment strategy in cases of central insulin and leptin resistance caused by diet-induced obesity. Under the third aim, the applicants will determine whether downstream oxytocin circuitry mediates the effects of a-MSH on erectile function using pharmacogenetics to examine whether this pathway is necessary and sufficient. A well-established cre-dependent viral tracer will then be employed to map downstream circuitry. The rationale for these studies is that they will be the first to address whether diabetes is accompanied by defective melanocortin signaling that may cause or exacerbate ED. The rising number of men with obesity and type 2 diabetes makes this research highly significant. Given the involvement of melanocortin pathways in regulating blood pressure, obesity, and glycemic control, the proposed research has the potential to guide the development of novel and effective therapies devoid of side effects that improve both the quality of life and overall health of these patients.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary  The 7th Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on NOX Family NADPH Oxidases, along with the 4th NOX Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for research trainees, is scheduled for May 27 to June 1, 2018, in Les Diablerets, Switzerland. Previous NOX GRCs were highly successful, attracting an average of 150 scientists from diverse backgrounds. The NOX GRC will feature unpublished cutting-edge work from international experts, including junior faculty. The preceding NOX GRS (May 26-27, 2018) addresses the interests and needs of research trainees, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and includes mentoring sessions.  NOX proteins are major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS), expressed in every tissue and cell type. This enzyme family is implicated in many physiological processes and pathologies, mainly due to its prominent role in ROS signaling. The field is advancing rapidly with exciting new developments, from basic biochemistry to structure elucidation and intra- and intercellular signaling, to a better understanding of NOX isoform-specific biological functions using in vivo models, genetic association of NOX enzymes to human disease, and drug development. The biennial NOX Gordon Conference is firmly established as the premier forum for the presentation and discussion of the latest advances in the field in a highly collegial, collaborative, and informal atmosphere. The 2018 NOX GRC/GRS meeting will branch out by connecting related fields to NOX. It includes innovative approaches and promises to be exciting and paradigm-challenging.  The program for the 2018 NOX GRC was developed around the theme NOX as Center of Redox Communication in Health and Disease. The NOX GRC Chair (Ulla Knaus, University College Dublin, Ireland) and Vice-Chair (Albert Van Der Vliet, University of Vermont, USA), along with the NOX GRS Chair (David Heppner, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, USA), have received extensive input from an International Program Advisory Committee and informal discussions. Overall, this process identified nine state-of-the-art session topics and speakers to showcase the breadth of the field and to widen the horizon. In particular, sessions on related and interconnected ROS sources, on Systems Redox Medicine and network analysis, and on controversial issues in the NOX field have been added to disease-oriented studies or sessions on fundamental biochemical and cell biological research. Sessions include 31% female speakers/discussion leaders and 26% junior faculty. Additional young investigators will be selected for short talks from submitted abstracts, accommodating cutting- edge late-breaking scientific advances (total number of speakers in categories trainee or early career investigator ~50%). We expect exciting, state-of-the-art presentations, along with ample time for vigorous discussion. Poster sessions will allow extended discussion and active involvement of trainees in an always friendly, supportive and informal atmosphere. The linked GRS program features speakers selected from among trainee abstracts, as well as career development components and mentoring by senior scientists.',\n",
       " 'Candida is the major fungal pathogen of humans, causing diseases that range from oral and vaginal candidiasis to life-threatening candidemia and invasive disease. The Candida research community focuses on a broad spectrum of subjects that relate to epidemiology, drug resistance, infection, host response, and therapeutics. The biennial Candida and Candidiasis Conference is the premier forum for presentation of cutting-edge advances and the latest perspectives in these diverse areas. Funds are requested for partial support for the 14th Conference on Candida and Candidiasis, to be held April 15 - 19, 2018, in Providence, RI. The conference is sponsored in part by the American Society for Microbiology, which provides both management expertise and financial support. The Program is based upon past conferences, which reliably draw approximately 300-350 U.S. and International scientists, and which have been met with consistent enthusiastic support in participant surveys.  The Program includes 17 sessions, with 5 or 6 speakers in each section. At least 65 of the talks will be selected based on submitted abstracts. Chairs for each session have been selected for their expertise in the subject area. This arrangement provides flexibility to present cutting-edge advances and to enlist a diverse spectrum of emerging and established speakers. Parallel sessions will address infection models, metabolic adaptation, fungal drug interactions and new technologies while encouraging productive interaction and discussion. ?Elevator talks? will allow junior scientists to summarize their poster in a few minutes on stage. Three afternoon poster sessions will allow discussion of the 250-350 posters. Clinical talks about the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of candidiasis will be incorporated into sessions that focus on key aspects of Candida infections, including environmental signaling, antifungal agents and resistance, and immune recognition. In a separate session on Candida case reports, clinicians will inform basic scientists about the challenges of diagnosing and treating different types of infection.  Our meeting has a strong track record of inclusion and, for example, 50% of confirmed session chairs in the current meeting are female. We are confident that we will meet the goals of the conference - to present the latest advances in the field, to spotlight achievements of junior scientists, and to ensure participation and promotion of diverse scientists, to promote synergistic and interdisciplinary interactions and to provide a venue for community-wide discussion.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Malaria remains a major global infectious disease, largely affecting people living in resource poor environments, and is one of the most important causes of childhood mortality. Drug-resistance is constantly undermining the usefulness of antimalarial regimens. There is an urgent need for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Plasmodium falciparum parasites utilize multiple ligand-receptor interactions for the invasion of human red blood cells, many of which are redundant. Different parasite strains rely on alternative ligand-interactions known as invasion pathways, for invasion, presumably for immune evasion and to invade polymorphic red blood cells. We have recently developed methods for the in vitro genetic analysis of red blood cell genes using hematopoietic stem cells. We have functionally characterized two red blood cell proteins, BSG and CD55, and have shown that they are essential for invasion by all P. falciparum strains, suggesting that they are strain- transcendent, prioritizing their interactions as targets for therapeutic development over strain-specific interactions. In forward genetic knockdown screens that assess all of membrane proteins found in the RBC proteome, we have identified a short list of high priority red blood cell determinants that we hypothesize are involved in strain-transcendent essential interactions between the host red blood cell and malaria parasite. In this proposal we will validate these genes as red blood cell determinants of strain- transcendent or strain- specific invasion. For this we will also leverage our development of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in an erythroid cell-line that supports P. falciparum invasion, and facilitates the knockout of RBC proteins. The precise step of P. falciparum invasion that is mediated by each red blood cell determinant will be identified. We will use the RBC mutants that we generate to identify specific parasite ligands using both candidate and unbiased screening approaches. Together, these studies will serve to shift the paradigm from a focus on alternative redundant invasion pathways to the functional analysis of essential strain-transcendent host- parasite interactions. In the long-term we hope that our studies will provide a functional understanding of critical ligand-receptor interactions for P. falciparum invasion of erythrocytes to inform vaccine development and the design of host-targeted therapeutics.',\n",
       " \"Performance measures are the specific care choices that are evaluated when judging the quality of care a doctor provides. Guiding quality of care with performance measurement was one of the greatest successes of the VHA transformation of the 1990s; reinvigorating performance measurement is a primary goal of today's VHA transformation. Current performance measures have known limitations. They do not personalize treatments' risks and benefits to individual patients. Some do not measure particularly important care or do not allow for appropriate patient- centered exceptions, such as for very ill patients. They create a burden for doctors. Doctors and clinical leaders have rarely had say in helping make scores useful and understandable. There is currently a push to summarize multiple performance measures into composite scores that measure a clinic's overall care. The best way to accomplish this, however, is unknown. Most health organizations and insurers use an approach that prioritizes simplicity. Medicare is developing an approach that prioritizes being able to distinguish one clinic from another ? have fewer ties. Here, we lay out a new ?benefit-based? approach; one that prioritizes the amount care can improve patient outcomes. Prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an ideal case for testing the performance measurement issues discussed above. It has an exceptionally strong clinical evidence base; CVD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in VA, and there has already been extensive work on developing individual performance measures. Furthermore, our work and that of others has already laid the groundwork for how care could be better personalized, and we already have a strong ongoing partnership with the VA Center for Analytics and Reporting. In this project, we propose examining alternative approaches to constructing composite performance measures for the medicines of CVD prevention, including statin, blood pressure, and anti-platelet therapies like aspirin. Can a more personalized, benefit-based CVD performance approach improve on conventional approaches to composite construction in reliability, validity, or usability? Is it feasible to create a composite that incorporates more clinical nuance, is preferred by VA leadership and frontline PACT members, and can be communicated in ways that help users improve their performance? This project focuses on CVD prevention, but the model being explored could be generalized to other conditions. In Aim 1, we will develop composite performance measures for cardiovascular disease prevention using three different techniques, including our new benefit-based approach. We will also explore the impact of different exclusions or improving data quality on performance measurement. In Aim 2, we will test and compare these new composite measures for reliability, validity, and their potential impact. In Aim 3, we will test the measures' acceptability and utility with clinicians and clinical and national leaders. This will include working with separate local and national stakeholder advisory groups and conducting formal semi-structured interviews. This will inform the measures themselves and how they are communicated to stakeholders.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly 195,800 men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (PCa) in the United States each year face difficulty in deciding whether potentially harmful PCa treatment is necessary due to our inability to accurately distinguish between indolent and aggressive PCa. Established prediction nomograms based on routine clinical and pathological features of PCa misclassify up to 60% of men with clinically significant cancer, most likely because these models do not effectively account for the myriad of biological mechanisms that can underlie metastatic potential. For the same reason, these existing prediction tools offer little insight on potential molecular targets for PCa treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that aberrant DNA methylation of numerous genes, including metastasis suppressors and genes that maintain cell differentiation status, is a major mechanism underlying tumor metastatic progression. We hypothesize that tumor DNA methylation of specific genes are predictive of PCa metastatic progression beyond routine clinical and pathological prognostic factors. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop DNA methylation marker-based prediction algorithms that will assist clinicians when providing therapeutic recommendations for men with localized PCa. Existing PCa study populations consist predominately of treated patients. They are not well-suited to address whether tumor DNA methylome measureable at PCa diagnosis is an important risk factor for metastasis because PCa treatment can alter disease course in at least some of these men. To evaluate the prognostic utility of DNA methylation markers measurable from diagnostic PCa biopsy, we propose a nested case-control study based on a retrospective cohort of 9,563 men who did not receive treatment when diagnosed with localized, Gleason grade 6-7 PCa (1997-2006) at Kaiser Permanente (KP). We will include 450 cases with metastasis and 450 matched controls selected during a 10-year follow-up period. The Specific Aims are: (1) to test the hypothesis that DNA methylation status of selected candidate genes can predict risk of PCa metastasis; (2) to identify novel DNA methylation markers of genes with previously unrecognized utility in predicting PCa metastasis from genome-wide methylation profiling using a discovery approach; and (3) to develop prediction algorithms of the 10-year risk of metastasis in men with localized PCa based on existing clinical PCa prognostic criteria and subsequently incorporating DNA methylation markers. This application takes advantage of unique resources in place at KP, University of California Los Angeles and San Francisco, and University of Southern California, leveraging a multidisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in prognosis studies, PCa epidemiology, epigenetics, pathology, clinical urology, and biostatistics. At the completion of these aims, we will identify DNA methylation markers that are predictive of PCa metastasis, provide insights on the molecular determinants of metastatic progression, and develop novel risk algorithms that extend existing algorithms to metastasis. 1',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under natural conditions, our visual experience is characterized by frequent eye movements as we scan a rich visual environment. Most experiments, however, have focused on neural responses under visually and behaviorally impoverished conditions, sacrificing realistic conditions for tractability. There is a growing realization that the brain's activity under these conditions does not always generalize to more natural settings, and experiments that probe neuronal dynamics under more complicated situations are needed. The long-term goal of this application is to determine how neural circuits in the primate brain act to generate coherent visual perception despite frequent eye movements and changes in internal cognitive state. The frontal eye field (FEF), a part of prefrontal cortex critical for controlling saccadic eye movements, plays a key role in this function through its unique position in the cortical hierarchy. FEF neurons serve both visual and motor functions, with connections to subcortical structures that control the eyes and to visual cortical areas. How do FEF neurons act in this gateway, serving the dual functions of integrating visual information to guide eye movements and informing the visual system about planned motor commands? One clue comes from studies of the phenomenon of predictive remapping, in which neurons shift their spatial preferences prior to an impending saccade. This occurs in FEF neurons as well as other cortical areas, and hints at the frequent and dynamic changes in their response properties. What kinds of dynamic changes are brought on by motor planning? How does the information necessary to generate these dynamics propagate through neuronal circuits? We will address these questions in three specific aims, the first of which uses rapidly presented sparse noise stimuli, an approach developed in early visual areas, to probe the dynamics of FEF neuronal responses. We hypothesize that FEF neurons have precise temporal dynamics, enabling responses to rapidly flashed stimuli, and nonlinear spatial summation, leading to strong responses to small stimuli that are perceived as potential saccade targets. The second specific aim is to measure the predictively remapped response with high spatial and temporal precision using the same noise stimulus. We hypothesize that remapping manifests as a gradual shift in the receptive field in the peri-saccadic time period, and this occurs for both guided saccades and more naturalistic spontaneous saccades. In the third specific aim, we attempt to isolate the neuronal circuitry responsible for these dynamic changes by recording simultaneously from a population of FEF neurons. We hypothesize that local circuitry within FEF is invoked to transfer information between neurons prior to an eye movement. The overall result of this study will be to establish the role of FEF in integrating visual perception and motor control during active vision, and to construct a framework for using receptive field mapping and population recordings to measure dynamic changes in neural circuits across visual and motor systems. This will aid in developing treatments for neurological disorders of vision and rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury or disease.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL The overall goal of this Program is to understand how basic cellular processes are altered and co-opted by cancer cells to promote tumor initiation and progression, and to apply this knowledge towards development of new therapeutic approaches. During the past 46 years, the strong underlying basic science foundation of the Program Project has allowed members to identify vulnerabilities in cancer and develop novel and highly specific therapeutic strategies. This Program continues to take a multi-pronged approach grounded in basic cancer research to identify and disrupt the molecular dependencies underlying cancer. Within this Program, there are five highly integrated Projects (Chromosome Inheritance; Regulation of Pre- mRNA Splicing in Tumorigenesis; Long Non-Coding RNAs and Cancer; Transcriptional Coactivators and Enhancers In Human Cancer; Tumor Suppressor and Tumor Maintenance Genes) and four innovative Cores that are using cutting edge technologies to study the molecular mechanisms of cancer biology. To achieve the Program's goals, these studies will exploit novel animal models of human cancers, pioneering functional genomics technologies, therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide strategies against otherwise undruggable targets, and cutting-edge methods in biochemistry, cell biology and molecular biology. The researchers will interrogate the basis of many of the most devastating types of tumors, including leukemias, breast, pancreatic, and highly aggressive liver cancers. All of this work is supported by four Cores that provide access to technologies, services, and expertise that all combine to enhance productivity and promote interactions. The interactive and collaborative nature of this Program guides each of these Projects beyond their singular potential. Research in all five Projects touches on overlapping themes and benefits from the expertise of the other Program members. Together, this Program is making significant progress towards its goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets that will substantially impact cancer treatment.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY- PROJECT 1 Cancer cells display uncontrolled inheritance of chromosomes, including errors in DNA replication and mitosis. These errors cause and propagate mutations and chromosomal abnormalities that further enhance cancer. Project 1 has been a leader in studying the mechanisms and control of inheritance of the human genome and has identified many of the key proteins that are involved in DNA synthesis at the replication fork and other proteins that are involved in the initiation of DNA replication. In the proposed studies, Project 1 will continue focusing on the mechanism and regulation of the initiation of DNA replication. Project 1 has discovered that certain initiation proteins are involved in many aspects of the cell division cycle, including centrosome duplication, centromere function and cytokinesis. Recent results also show that some initiation proteins are intimately involved in the fundamental decision of whether newly born cells will commit to a new round of cell division or enter into a period of quiescence. The proposed research will fall into three areas. Specific Aim 1 will focus on the role of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) subunit ORC1 and its related protein CDC6 in regulation of the commitment to cell division by controlling the expression of E2F1-regulated genes, in addition to the gene encoding Cyclin E, in cooperation with the tumor suppressor protein RB and the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1. Aim 1 will also focus on how CDC6 cooperates with ORC, RB, SUV39H1 and Cyclin dependent kinases to promote initiation of DNA replication. Specific Aim 2 will continue to study the role of the ORC subunits ORC2 and ORC3 at centromeres. ORC2 interacts with the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint protein BUBR1 only when it is phosphorylated during mitosis and defects in the BUBR1 binding domain of ORC2 cause the persistence of chromosomes that fail to align at the metaphase plate. Aim 2 will determine how ORC2 binds to BUBR1 and controls access of BUBR1. How ORC2 and ORC3 are recruited to centromeres, and the role of ORC3 interaction with the HP1 heterochromatin protein in chromosome segregation will also be studied. Project 3 will also study E2f1-regulated control of cell proliferation in a subset of breast and colon epithelial cancers have an acquired dependence of the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5. DDX5 is also required for progression of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This Aim will investigate how DDX5 becomes essential in some adult cancers and AML, while dispensable in normal epithelial and normal hematopoietic cells. Both RNA and protein binding partners will be identified, comparing both DDX5-dependent (DDX5-D) and DDX5-independent (DDX5-I) breast cancer cells. Exploiting the differential dependence on DDX5, Anti-Sense Oligonucleotides (ASO) will be developed for studying the role of DDX5 in mouse models for breast cancer and AML.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The African Ancestry-Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (AA-GPC), will support a large expansion of the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (GPC) (current n=33,000) that expands the collection and genomic analysis of patients suffering with schizophrenia and controls with African ancestry (AA). The GPC is a large clinical cohort of patients with schizophrenia (n=10,000), patients with bipolar disorder (n=5,000), family members (n=3,000), and control participants with no history or family history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (n=15,000) (Pato, 2013). The GPC's successful enrollment of nearly 6,000 AA research participants (3,000 suffering from schizophrenia and 3,000 controls) supports the enrollment capacity of the GPC network in African American communities. Our objective through this project is to increase AA schizophrenia cohorts to 22,000 research participants (11,000 AA patients suffering from schizophrenia and 11,000 AA controls), and to draw upon the genomes of these individuals to increase our understanding of genetic influences on schizophrenia. More specifically: 1) We will create an overall GPC cohort for the field of 18,525 AA participants - 8,817 suffering from  schizophrenia and 9,708 controls - by enrolling an additional 5,817 patients and 6,708 control  participants. Existing NIMH AA samples (2,183 cases and 1,292 controls) will be added to the extent allowed under existing consents and availability of bio-samples. In total, the maximum number of AA samples to be genomically characterized is 22,000. 2) We will study genome variation in this large African-ancestry schizophrenia cohort - using a strategic combination of exome sequencing, custom array analysis, and whole genome sequencing - to both broaden and deepen our understanding of genetic variation that influences risk of schizophrenia. As with our current efforts in this area, NIMH investment will be amplified by a contribution  of philanthropic funds from the Broad Institute's Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and a top cause of serious long-term disability. A number of stroke risk factors have been established at the individual-level; however, these risk factors only partially explain stroke risk and account for only half of the racial disparities in stroke. Novel exposures of stroke risk must be identifie to improve our understanding of stroke risk and to develop effective interventions. Recently, built and social environments (BSEs) have been identified as important factors to examine to further our understanding of cardiovascular disease. However, to date no studies have examined the effect of BSEs on stroke risk. BSEs may also help to explain the large racial and geographic disparities in stroke rates although this has yet to be empirically examined nationally. The proposed study would address these gaps by utilizing a unique assembled cohort, namely the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. The REGARDS cohort is a national sample of adults over age 45, with oversamples of African-American participants and persons in the stroke belt. The proposed study will expand the REGARDS study to examine the effects of BSEs on incident stroke risk and on racial and geographic disparities in stroke. These aims will be achieved by obtaining data on a broad range of BSE characteristics of the REGARDS participants' built environment (e.g., food availability, park availability, food prices, physical activity facility availability, land use, steet connectivity and neighborhood physical environment) and participants' social environment (objective crime, perceived crime, neighborhood SES, social cohesion, racial residential segregation, social support and social networks, and neighborhood social environment). The data will be obtained from a number of sources including secondary commercial and administrative sources, participant self-reports and primary audits using the Street View feature in Google Earth. Environmental data will be spatially linked to participant data of the REGARDS case-cohort study. The proposed study aims to 1) examine the extent to which BSEs contribute to incident stroke risk in the REGARDS study; and 2) determine the extent to which BSEs explain racial and geographic disparities in incident stroke. The proposed study builds on important preliminary studies and the extensive relevant experience of the investigative team, which includes prominent scholars across a number of institutions. The proposed research provides a cost-effective way to examine the importance of BSEs for stroke prevention across diverse community settings and racial groups. Identifying the BSE characteristics that are predictive of incident stroke and BSEs that contribute to racial and geographic disparities will help inform future modifications of environments to improve population health. At the end of the study period, the BSE data will be made available to others through the REGARDS data sharing protocols; thus the measures in the proposed study will be available to the greater scientific community for use in research pertaining to other disease outcomes.\",\n",
       " 'Sepsis causes more deaths in U.S. hospitals annually than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined. Elderly patients are a particularly high-risk group, with an incidence rate of ~60% of all septic cases. The elderly are also extremely vulnerable to the consequences of sepsis, showing 100-fold higher mortality than younger patients. Some of these deaths occur acutely after sepsis, but ~70% of these patients survive the initial infection, and succumb to opportunistic infections during the chronic phase of sepsis. The chronic stage of sepsis is important and is characterized by immunosuppression, but little is known about the mechanisms of sepsis-induced immunosuppression. CD4 T cells, essential for coordinating immune responses to a range of pathogens, are severely depleted during the acute stage of sepsis, and gradually recover throughout the immunosuppressive phase of sepsis. Our recent publication included data showing certain Ag-specific CD4 T cell populations do not recover, despite quantitative restoration of total CD4 T cells. We suspect that the prolonged loss of Ag-specific CD4 T cells introduces ?gaps? within the T cell repertoire leading to overall decreased adaptive immune system function. Among the immunological settings where CD4 T cell function is vital, this proposal will define the mechanisms responsible for the impairment of CD4 T cell-dependent B cell responses using the CLP model followed by secondary immunization or heterologous pathogen infection. Accordingly, our central hypothesis holds that alterations in the number and function of both follicular helper CD4 T (Tfh) cells and B cells after sublethal CLP-induced sepsis is responsible for suppressed humoral immunity and reduced protection against pathogens encountered within the context of localized or systemic secondary infections. The following specific aims will test our hypothesis: Aim 1) Define the sepsis-induced defects in Ag-specific CD4 T cells and B cells that restrict the generation of a productive CD4 T cell-dependent B cell response; Aim 2) Investigate the ability of therapies designed to restore DC or B cell number and function to revitalize humoral immunity after sepsis; and Aim 3) Determine the impact of sepsis on the maintenance and function of pre- existing memory CD4 T cells and B cells. Ultimately, this proposal will increase our understanding of why septic patients are more susceptible to secondary infections. Our use of the CLP model of polymicrobial sepsis, our ability to identify and study the function of endogenous Ag-specific CD4 T cells and B cells, and our experience measuring the adaptive immune response to infectious pathogens put us in the perfect position to define the mechanism(s) driving sepsis-induced suppression of CD4 T cell-dependent B cell immunity.',\n",
       " \"The pathophysiology of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a rapidly progressive and deadly fibrotic lung disease remains poorly understood. Aging is a well-recognized risk factor for IPF, and IPF disproportionately affects the aging veteran population. Given this shift in demographic, it is critical to understand the contribution of aging to the cellular/molecular mechanism(s) leading to the pathogenesis of age-related diseases, such as IPF. In resolving fibrosis, lung myofibroblasts (the key `scar tissue generating' cell) undergo apoptosis to promote healing. In contrast, myofibroblasts from aged mice with non-resolving fibrosis acquire a senescent and apoptosis-resistant phenotype, mediated in part by persistent expression of NADPH- oxidase-4 (Nox4). Similarly, lung myofibroblasts from IPF patients exhibit senescence and apoptosis- resistance, associated with elevated Nox4 expression. However, the mechanisms that drive persistence of Nox4 and apoptosis-resistance of myofibroblasts in the context of aging/IPF remain unknown. We have identified a critical role for Nampt, a known regulator of innate immune responses and apoptosis, in driving the senescent and apoptosis-resistant myofibroblast phenotype in age-associated pathological lung fibrosis. We demonstrate that Nampt is upregulated in vivo in 2 injury models of age-dependent fibrosis, and in fibrotic regions of the IPF lung. Intracellular Nampt (iNampt) is persistently expressed in senescent and IPF fibroblasts, which fail to undergo apoptosis, and these cells secrete significantly elevated levels of extracellular Nampt (eNampt). We found that eNampt mediates profibrotic effects via TLR4, including myofibroblast differentiation, oxidative signaling, senescence, and apoptosis-resistance. Our data suggest that defective TGF-mediated downregulation of iNampt in senescent/IPF fibroblasts contributes to persistent iNampt expression, subsequent elevated eNampt levels, which promotes profibrotic effects. Reductions in Nampt expression facilitated myofibroblast apoptosis and led to protection from fibrosis in vivo. The mechanisms that drive continued propagation of fibrogenic responses, beyond initial injury, are not well understood. We propose a novel auto-regulatory mechanism (eNampt/iNampt), which temporally reinforces profibrotic responses in age-dependent pathological fibrosis. These studies will prvide insight into novel age-relevant mechanisms/cellular phenotypes in IPF pathogenesis. Further, we will evaluate the pre-clinical efficacy of FK-866 (iNampt inhibitor currently in phase II clinical trials as an anti-cancer agent) in rigorous aging animal models of fibrosis, enhancing the potential fo rapid clinical translation of novel therapeutics for IPF.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) in association with severe multisystem inflammatory disease manifestations. ANAs target a wide array of nuclear macromolecules and can mediate disease by the formation of immune complexes that deposit in the tissue to promote inflammation and damage; these complexes can also stimulate the production of cytokines including type 1 interferon to drive generalized immune system disturbances. Among ANAs forming immune complexes, antibodies to DNA (anti-DNA) are the serological hallmark of SLE and markers of diagnosis and prognosis. These antibodies bind to both single and double stranded DNA and form immune complexes that deposit in the tissue, especially the kidney, to promote inflammation; in addition, these immune complexes can stimulate the production of cytokines by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, triggering internal sensors of DNA. While the properties of anti-DNA antibodies have been extensively studied, much less is known about the origin of antigenic DNA, its access to the immune system and its unique molecular properties. In general, the source of this DNA has been considered to be nuclear in origin and the product of dead and dying cells. Our studies have provided a new perspective on this issue by demonstrating two important features of extracellular DNA: 1) its existence in the form of microparticles and 2) the presence in these particles of mitochondrial (mt) as well as nuclear DNA (nDNA). This presence of mtDNA is important since mtDNA is intrinsically immunostimulatory because of structural features that differ from those of nDNA. These involve CpG motifs in mtDNA, a consequence of the origin of mitochondria from bacteria, and oxidation of guanosine residues. Furthermore, we have shown that mitochondria released from cells have properties similar to those of microparticles, suggesting that mitochondria may serve as self-antigens in lupus, contributing to immune activities attributed to microparticles and providing a nidus for immune complex formation. Building on preliminary work, the proposed studies will focus on three main hypotheses: 1) DNA autoantigen can be released from cells undergoing various death forms and exist in both a free and particle form; 2) the metabolism of DNA during cell death influences the amount in the blood, its size and its representation in particle or soluble form; and 3) anti-DNA antibodies can bind to various antigenic forms of DNA, both free and particulate, with assay of antibodies to these forms providing more informative biomarkers. We will pursue three specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To determine the extracellular release of cellular DNA during different forms of in vitro cell death. We will induce different forms of cell death in cell lines in vitro and determine the representation of mtDNA and nDNA in soluble and particulate forms; Specific Aim 2. To use in vivo models to elucidate the release of DNA into the blood. We will use in vivo systems in the mouse to explore the release of mtDNA and nDNA following cell death; we will also sequence DNA in the blood by high throughput techniques; and Specific Aim 3: Using blood from patients with lupus and murine models, we will determine the presence and specificity of antibodies to various sources of extracellular DNA in SLE. To develop new serological approaches, we will determine the presence and specificity of antibodies to different antigenic forms of DNA, both free and particulate and, by assessing results from a large panel of well characterized patients, develop new biomarkers. Successful completion of these experiments will provide new insights into the mechanisms of pathogenicity as well as provide new biomarkers for clinical and research purposes.',\n",
       " \"Regulation of epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) expression in the kidney is critical to the maintenance of extracellular Na+ and volume homeostasis. This in turn plays an important role in blood pressure control, as illustrated by the observation that ENaC mutations cause inherited forms of hypertension (Liddle's syndrome) and hypotension (PHA type 1). The overall goal of our proposal is to elucidate signaling mechanisms and trafficking pathways that regulate ENaC. Building on our work in the previous funding period, we will focus on a novel signaling pathway that regulates ENaC trafficking under conditions of hyperglycemia. Previous work indicates that in diabetes mellitus, renal Na+ absorption in the distal nephron is enhanced, and ENaC abundance is increased. This may serve to counter Na+ and volume wasting induced by hyperglycemia. Moreover, there is a critical link between diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Hypertension is two-fold more common in diabetics than in the general population and it dramatically increases the risk for cardiovascular complications. Previous work suggests a causative role for excessive renal Na+ reabsorption in the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated hypertension. However, the underlying mechanisms linking diabetes and hypertension, as well as the mechanisms to explain enhanced ENaC abundance, have not been identified. In this proposal, we will address this critical gap in our knowledge. In preliminary studies, we found that ENaC current was increased by exposure of collecting duct epithelia to elevated glucose concentrations within the range found in patients with diabetes mellitus. Glucose increased current by increasing ENaC abundance at the cell surface. Additional preliminary data support a role for an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4-2, in this regulation. Based on these findings, we propose an overall hypothesis that hyperglycemia increases renal Na+ absorption by altering Nedd4-2- regulated trafficking of ENaC. We propose three specific aims to test this model. This work has the potential to define a mechanistic link between diabetes and the disrupted volume homeostasis that underlies hypertension, and on our understanding of how they are interrelated.\",\n",
       " 'We propose a set of studies focused on the association of suicide with neuroinflammation and compromise of the blood-brain barrier, with the goal of identifying a pattern of quantifiable abnormalities that could serve as a biomarker for imminent suicidal risk in our Veterans. Autopsy studies are uniquely suited to do this, because they capture the state of the brain at the time of the suicidal act.  Findings from our laboratories and others indicate that susceptibility to suicide includes inflammatory activation in the brain and systemically, accompanied by compromised integrity of the blood-brain barrier: (1) Most directly, we reported increased densities of microglia or other phagocytic cells associated with blood vessels in dorsal prefrontal white matter of people who died by suicide, Similar results are reported in cingulate white matter. (2) Studies of brains from individuals who died by suicide and studies of blood and CSF from live individuals who had previously attempted suicide found elevations of inflammatory cytokines. (3) Various infectious diseases are associated with increased risk of suicide, as is a history of hospitalization for any infection. (4) Laboratory animals exposed to stress show elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, behavioral abnormalities, and activation of microglia. (5) We have reported an association of suicide with a polymorphism and decreased frontal and cingulate transcripts for CD44, which is involved in the normal function of the BBB. (6) Biochemical measures suggesting BBB impairment are reportedly associated with attempted suicide and with suicidal ideation. (7) In MDD subjects who died by suicide, compared with nonpsychiatric non-suicide cases, we found differential methylation of genes associated with cell death, both in whole cortical homogenates and in purified neuronal fractions. We also found significantly lower methylation in the promoter of the gene for CCL3, a powerful inflammatory cytokine synthesized by microglia and astrocytes and an attractant for microglia and white blood cells, but this difference was not present in the purified neuronal fraction.  Taken together, these findings lead us to hypothesize a suicidal state characterized by impaired BBB function, elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and abnormalities in DNA methylation of genes stimulating inflammation, all of which can be assessed in live individuals. To confirm this phenotype, we propose three specific aims, each employing the same set of 90 autopsy brains, already collected. In order to distinguish features of suicide from those of psychiatric illness, we employ a 3-group design with 30 cases of psychiatric disease and suicide, 30 cases of psychiatric disease without suicide, and 30 cases with neither psychiatric disease nor suicide, all from a well-characterized collection with a single collection protocol at a single autopsy service. To optimize our ability to distinguish features of suicide from those of psychiatric disease, in addition to finding the best matches between groups by age and sex, we sought to limit all of the psychiatric cases to a single clinical group, which was best achieved with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Our specific aims, for each of which we will assay cerebral cortex and white matter from dorsal and ventral prefrontal regions, are: (1) To evaluate functional BBB impairment by stereological assessment of perivascular deposits of fibronectin. (2) To quantify a panel of cytokines, and to look for structural evidence of BBB impairment by assaying isolated microvessel fractions for vascular tight junction proteins and matrix metalloproteases.(3) To identify transcriptional correlates of BBB alterations with a genome-wide methylation survey on microvessel fractions of cortex and white matter from each region, using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray .These data will allow us to establish the underlying abnormalities for development of a suicidal profile to better, identify and treat veterans at risk of suicide. Knowledge and application of this profile will save Veterans? lives by identifying potential targets for novel clinical interventions.',\n",
       " 'Brain ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury due to stroke and cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, affecting thousands of Veterans every year. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying brain IR injury are still not completely understood. The objective of this proposal is to study a novel hypothesis that brain IR leads to a cascade of events resulting in inactivation of N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF), massive buildup of damaged late endosomes (LEs), fatal release of cathepsin B (CTSB), induction of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), and delayed neuronal death.  NSF is the sole ATPase controlling membrane trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the endosome- lysosome system. Our recent studies show that NSF ATPase is progressively trapped as inactive aggregates within hippocampal CA1 neurons destined to undergo delayed neuronal death after brain IR. Our electron microscopic (EM) studies further show massive accumulation of damaged Golgi, transport vesicles (Vs), and late endosomes (LEs) in the CA1 neurons. Consequently, CTSB is extensively released from damaged Golgi/Vs/LEs structures, followed by delayed neuronal death after brain IR. We therefore generated a neuron-specific NSF activity-deficient transgenic (tg) mouse line (replacement of NSF 329 glutamate with glutamine, i.e., E329Q). The most prominent pathological phenotypes of this E329Q tg mouse line are massive accumulation of damaged Golgi/Vs/LEs, and release of CTSB, followed by delayed neuronal death. These phenotypes are virtually identical to those observed in hippocampal CA1 neurons destined to undergo delayed neuronal death after brain IR. Based on these new discoveries, we propose to test a novel hypothesis strongly supported by preliminary studies, i.e., brain IR leads to a cascade of events of NSF inactivation, massive buildup of Golgi/Vs/LEs, release of CTSB, induction of MOMP, and delayed neuronal death. We will use the E329Q tg mouse line, CTSB knockout (KO) mice, and cutting-edge technologies to study these molecular events after brain IR.  Aim 1 will test the novel hypothesis that NSF inactivation results in fatal release of CTSB and delayed neuronal death after brain IR. We will use the E329Q tg mice without brain IR and wildtype (wt) littermates subjected to brain IR to test this novel hypothesis. Aim 2 will test the novel hypothesis that fatal release of CTSB leads to induction of MOMP after brain IR. We will use CTSB KO mice to test this novel hypothesis. This Aim is based on the finding that cytosolic release of CTSB induces MOMP, resulting in delayed neuronal death after brain IR. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the NSF inactivation-induced cascade of events is a common pathway responsible for delayed neuronal death after brain IR. The rationale for Aim 3 is that studies in Aims 1 and 2 focus on the role of NSF inactivation in the hippocampal CA1 neurons after brain IR. A broader and perhaps even more important question is: is NSF inactivation commonly responsible for delayed neuronal death in all populations of hippocampal and neocortical neurons after brain IR? We will test this hypothesis by: (i) studying the damaging effects on the NSF-CTSB-MOMP pathway in ?ischemic resistant? CA3, DG and neocortical neurons after prolonged brain IR; (ii) examining whether CTSB KO can prevent delayed neuronal death in ?ischemic resistant? neurons after prolonged brain IR; and (iii) investigating whether the increased vulnerability in ?ischemic resistant? neurons in E329Q tg mice is due to the weakening of the NSF active store, resulting in CTSB release and induction of MOMP after brain IR. These studies will provide insights into the novel mechanism underlying brain IR injury and identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of brain IR injury.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary: Collagen is continuously degraded and remodeled as well as produced in both health and fibrotic disease. Our laboratory has demonstrated that the intracellular pathway of collagen uptake and degradation is tightly regulated. In mouse models, the intracellular pathways of collagen degradation have been shown to be important in modulating pulmonary fibrosis. However, the specific mechanisms that regulate collagen internalization and degradation in cells remain incompletely elucidated. Currently, there are no therapies that target these pathways to modulate and augment degradation of fibrotic tissue even though this would have a significant impact on patients with established fibrotic disease. Our laboratory previously published an RNAi- based screen of drosophila phagocytes that identified promising candidate genes that may regulate collagen uptake in mammals including Cell division cycle 7 (CDC7) kinase. The knockdown of this gene led to increased collagen uptake in multiple in vitro systems and this also corresponded with increased expression of a canonical collagen endocytic receptor. These findings raise the interesting possibility that regulatory mechanisms exist that inhibit collagen degradation and these could be exploited to treat fibrosis. Based on these findings, the proposed studies are designed to explore (1) how CDC7 regulates collagen endocytic machinery and (2) whether inhibition of the CDC7 pathway regulates collagen turnover in vivo both at the cellular level and in accelerating the resolution of experimental fibrosis in a well-established murine model. We anticipate that these experiments will expand our understanding of matrix biology and provide the foundation for the design of therapies that could treat human disease.',\n",
       " 'Summary The 2018 Gordon Research Conference on New Antibacterial Discovery and Development and the companion Gordon Research Seminar will bring highly experienced leaders in antibacterial drug discovery and development together with young investigators and those new to the field of antibiotics research in order to enable the next generation of safe and effective drugs. Discussion leaders and speakers are chosen from academia, industry, and government agencies to emphasize the breadth of talent and leadership necessary to drive innovation around target discovery and validation, hit identification and chemical optimization, and clinical trial design and execution. Previous meetings have defined the problem of antibiotic resistance, the challenges in antibiotic discovery and development faced over the past two decades, and the need for new pathways for clinical development. Those meetings have successfully created a community of idea generation and collaboration in what is otherwise a highly competitive scientific arena. This meeting will build on those foundations by exploring 1) novel strategies for achieving potent and safe antibacterial drugs against the most difficult-to-treat organisms, 2) new approaches for diagnosing infections with the goal of broadening the opportunities for clinical development as well as guiding the appropriate use of precious new antibacterial drugs in the clinic, and 3) learnings from recent clinical programs with new and established targets which may be translatable to the next generation of antibacterial drugs. Many strategic and organizational changes have taken place in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry over the last few years as well as a shift in emphasis at academic and government research facilities from early basic science to translational research. Because of the ever-changing environment, there has never been a more critical time for fostering a community of intellectuals dedicated to innovation and calculated risk-taking. This GRC/GRS will enablecritical thinking, robust discussions around data gathering and interpretation, and learning from each other?s challenges and successes. Most importantly the GRC/GRS meeting will provide a community and support network for scientists who have dedicated their careers to one of the most difficult and essential areas of human medicine.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Co-location networks ? two-mode networks that capture connections between individuals and locations in geographic space ? have broad relevance in the health sciences in areas ranging from the study of infectious disease transmission to understanding the influence of social processes on health outcomes and behaviors. Despite their broad relevance, however, statistical methods for understanding co-location networks are limited. This methodologically oriented proposal focuses on the development of a statistical framework for the study of co-location networks using a bilinear mixed-effects model with interacting latent activity pattern motifs and profiles. Through latent interacting random effects, our model captures the dependence between individuals based on their shared use of space and between locations based on the individuals who frequent them. Our flexible modeling framework uses a mixed-membership structure to relax the assumption that activity profiles are static and takes advantage of a data augmentation strategy to allow versions of the model with either direct or indirect specification of the dependence between actor-location ties. Our novel statistical models will be used in analyses of activity pattern data collected as part of the Adolescent Health and Development in Context (AHDC) Study, an ongoing data collection effort in Franklin County, Ohio. Through GPS-based smartphone tracking and space-time budget software, the AHDC Study provides rich detail on the co-location networks of adolescents in the study area. In addition, a wealth of survey data, smartphone-administered Ecological Momentary Assessments (capturing real-time measures of location, social network partner presence, activities, risk behaviors, and mood), and biomeasure data on the study participants are available. Recognizing that our proposed statistical model may not be able to capture the structure the co-location network structure of AHDC adolescents based entirely on their observed activity patterns, we also propose to embed relevant information derived from social media into our analyses through informative prior distributions on model parameters. To do so, we propose novel data mining algorithms to retrieve potential activity pattern motifs and coincident profiles from Twitter posts and network structure. In particular, we extend named entity identification methods to the spatial setting to automatically retrieve information relevant to activity patterns and develop novel methods for prioritizing activity pattern information based on its relevance to particular subpopulations (here, adolescents) using scalable sentiment analysis. Using our new statistical and data mining methodology, we will perform detailed statistical analyses to explore the relationship between spatial and socio-spatial exposures derived from an inferred co-location network and physiological stress in adolescents.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY While the existence of multiple memory systems in the brain is generally accepted, it is not known how these different systems interact to result in continuously adaptive memory-guided behaviors and decisions. Recent results clearly show that particular combinations of memory-related brain systems show synchronized neural activity (at the population level, for example at the theta frequency) in a task-dependent way. Yet the informational and behavioral significance of such co-modulation of neural activity in not known perhaps in part because such measures are not temporally or informationally refine enough to reveal the significance of this interaction. This proposal aims to develop a novel paradigm for determining whether a specific type of information in one brain area can provide a signal to a connected memory structure to engage or disengage in its well-known memory-related function. Specifically, Aim 1 will test the causal relationship between neural signatures of planned behaviors in hippocampus and the regulation of working memory/action selection by the medial prefrontal cortex. Also, the subsequent impact of this neural directive on future action selection, as well as on future hippocampal place field integrity, will be examined. It is postulated that prefrontal cortex normally stabilizes place fields which in turn should enable rats to more quickly adapt to changing task conditions. Disruption of such prefrontal function, especially during the operation of working memory, should destabilize place fields and EEG phenomena that rely on fully function place fields. In addition, impaired choice accuracy is predicted. Aim 2 proposes to build on the exciting idea that hippocampal theta oscillates between periods of memory encoding and memory retrieval. The same open loop system that was developed in Aim 1 will be used to disrupt selectively working memory encoding or retrieval functions of the medial prefrontal cortex when encoding or retrieval are detected in hippocampus. The general prediction is that disrupting encoding in the prefrontal cortex will disproportionately impair the initial learning behavioral and neural processes relative to behavioral and neural processes that go on after learning has taken place. The combined results will provide new insight into the informational nature of communication between hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Also the closed loop paradigm can serve as an innovative and new model for studying the functional interactions between other memory and behavioral systems of the brain, which in turn can have tremendous clinical and therapeutic benefits. It may be possible to interfere with (in cases of unwanted specific associations) or facilitate (in cases of deficient desired associations) specific types of learning or learned associations that characterize a number of mental disorders.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ? 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program.\",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Malaria-related mortality is falling, due in part to the implementation of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) treatment programs. RDTs have become the primary modality for diagnosis of malaria globally, including in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most widely used RDTs rely on the detection of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), an antigen specific to P? lasmodium falciparum? encoded by the ?pfhrp2? gene. However, false-negative results have recently been reported in individuals infected with P? . falciparum ?parasites harboring a deletion of the ?pfhrp2? gene with or without a deletion in a related histidine-rich protein gene, pfhrp3?. These parasites have been commonly described in South America and sporadically in other regions, including Africa. Until recently, the prevalence and impact of ?pfhrp2? deletions deletions in Africa was unknown. We recently completed a large cross-sectional survey of more than 7,000 children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where RDTs have been the primary mode of diagnosis since 2011. We found that 6.4% of parasitemic children had false-negative RDTs due to a p? fhrp2? deletion. In Kinshasa province, more than 20% of infections were due to ?pfhrp2?-deleted parasites. Similar findings are being made in other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, raising the possibility that HRP2-based RDTs are becoming ineffective. Currently, our collaborators are conducting a longitudinal cohort study in Kinshasa to evaluate the epidemiology of ?pfhrp2/3 deleted parasites. Our proposal will leverage this cohort to achieve our short-term goals to (1) understand the evolutionary drivers of these deletions in the DRC, the country in Africa with the second-highest malaria burden; and (2) to develop a simple PCR assay for ?pfhrp2/3? deletion surveillance so that malaria control programs can implement alternative diagnostics when needed. Our long-term goal is to develop alternate biomarkers and noninvasive diagnostic tests for malaria diagnosis and test them in an area of HRP2-based RDT failure. This proposal is unique in that it will help characterize an emerging public health problem while simultaneously seeking solutions. As a result, there is a high likelihood that the results of this research will significantly impact the next generation of point of care malaria diagnostic tests.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Reversible epigenetic modifications on DNA and proteins play essential roles in controlling gene expression. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that RNA also contains reversible modifications and that they play essential roles in processes including fertility, development, and leukemia. Notably, modifications on RNA hold critical functions in the viral life cycle, affecting viruses such as Zika virus, HIV-1, and Hepatitis C virus. 2?-O-Methyl (2?OMe) is an abundant post-transcriptional RNA modification in eukaryotic and viral RNA, and recent studies showed that its presence on the 5? cap of viral RNA protects viruses from detection by the host immune response. We have identified that 2?OMe is also present on non-terminal nucleotides located internally in viral RNAs. However, the roles and locations of these internal 2?OMe marks remain undefined. Understanding how these 2?OMe marks affect viral infection may allow us to manipulate 2?OMe to suppress infection. To understand the roles of internal 2?OMe marks, we recently developed Nm-seq, a novel high-throughput sequencing technique that profiles 2?OMe at single-nucleotide precision with high sensitivity. This proposal aims to use Nm-seq and a combination of virological, molecular biological, biochemical, and genetic approaches to identify biological roles of internal 2?OMe in viral infection. Based on studies in other systems, we hypothesize that internal 2?OMe affects viral infection by impacting viral RNA replication, translation efficiency, interactions with host immune sensors, and infectious virus production. We will first use Nm-seq to determine the locations of internal 2?OMe modifications in two model viruses: Zika virus and Murine norovirus. We will then determine the functions of 2?OMe in the viral life cycle using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase replication assays of 2?OMe-modified or unmodified viral RNA; in vitro translation assays of 2?OMe-modified or unmodified viral RNA; RNA affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry to identify host proteins that bind preferentially to 2?OMe- modified or unmodified RNA; and viral infection experiments in cells depleted of a 2?OMe methyltransferase to measure infectious virus production. Our results will be the first to elucidate mechanisms by which internal 2?OMe affects viral infection, laying the groundwork for studies of therapeutic avenues to treat viral infection by targeting 2?OMe marks and the processes they affect. Our findings will also serve as a foundation for future investigations of 2?OMe in viral and eukaryotic RNA.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION: Infection with HIV-1 can induce dementia for which a treatment is currently not available. Experimental evidence from our and other laboratories strongly suggests that HIV-1 infection and neurotoxic stimulation of microglia and macrophages (M?) in the brain trigger neuronal damage and impairment of neurogenesis. We recently observed that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 was required in both M?/microglia for induction of HIV/gp120 toxicity and in neurons for initiation of apoptosis by M? toxins. In follow-up studies we found that knockdown of p38? MAPK by specific siRNAs down-regulated cysteinyl leukotriene synthase (LTC4S) in M?. We also discovered that blockade of the cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) protected cerebrocortical neurons against toxicity of gp120-stimulated or HIV-infected M?. Therefore, we propose to study in vivo how genetic deletion of LTC4S or blockade of CysLTR1 affects brain injury caused by HIV-1 or its envelope gp120. We hypothesize that ablation of CysLT production or CysLTR1 inhibition can prevent HIV and gp120 from inducing neuronal injury and behavioral impairment. The long-term objectives are to find new protective strategies against brain injury by HIV infection. The specific aims (SA) are: (1) To determine in vivo whether genetic deletion of cysteinyl-leukotriene synthase (LTC4S) prevents neuronal injury and behavioral impairment in a HIV/gp120 transgenic mouse model. (2) To investigate in vivo whether pharmacological inhibition of CysLTR1 ameliorates neuronal damage in a HIV/gp120 transgenic mouse model. (3) To assess in vitro how the blockade of CysLTR1 or knockout (KO) of LTC4S enables neuronal survival in the presence of HIV-induced macrophage toxins. Transgenic mice expressing HIV/gp120 will be cross-bred with LTC4SKO animals (SA1) and Montelukast will be used to block CysLTR1 (SA2). Memory and cognition-based behavioral performance, neuronal injury and glial cell activation will be compared in LTC4SKO versus wild-type and Montelukast- versus vehicle-treated HIV/gp120-transgenic mice for SA1 and 2, respectively. For SA3, we will use pharmacological inhibition of CysLTR1 besides LTC4SKO and wild-type cerebrocortical neurons and astrocytes exposed to conditioned media of HIV-infected and un-infected, primary human M?. All three SAs will employ multi-dimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics to profile CysLTs in comparison to other cellular lipids and mediators in different parts of the brain (SA1 and 2) and neurons, astrocytes and M? (SA3). For all three SAs neuronal injury and death will be analyzed by deconvolution microscopy after immunolabeling for neuronal cellular and synaptic markers and staining of nuclear DNA by Hoechst dye. All three Specific Aims will test the premise that deletion of CysLT production or blockade of CysLTR1 prevents inflammatory and injurious processes in favor of neuroprotective mechanisms, such as reduced activity of p38 MAPK and Caspase 3, and increased activity of Akt,. We will also assess in vivo whether LTC4SKO and CysLTR1 blockade can preserve memory and cognition and ameliorate gliosis in the presence of HIV/gp120.',\n",
       " 'Anticipated Impact on Veterans Health Care: Nearly 25% of VA users are diagnosed with diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, end stage renal disease, amputations and a significant cause of hospitalizations for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Mortality rates among veterans with diabetes are twice as high compared to veterans without diabetes. In 2012, diabetes was estimated to cost $176 billion in direct medical and indirect costs. These health and cost implications make the effective management of diabetes a policy priority for healthcare providers and policymakers nationwide. This proposal will move beyond hemoglobin A1c (A1c) control to prevent diabetes complications and assess the role of A1c variability. Project Background: A major focus of diabetes management is glucose control, since persistently elevated A1c levels predict adverse health outcomes including microvascular complications. But lowering A1c to moderately stringent targets (<7%) could increase risks of macrovascular disease or mortality. There are increasing data showing that glucose variability plays a significant role in predicting risk of complications. Longer term variability as reflected in A1c fluctuations over time has been linked to risk of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. We have shown that among Veterans with diabetes, increasing A1c variability over a 3 year period is independently associated with risk of MI, ambulatory care sensitive condition hospitalization, and mortality. We wish to further study this for its potential clinical application by developing and validating a novel clinical measure of A1c variability that is unique to each patient.  Project Objectives: We propose an observational study to (a) construct statistical measures and determine  predictors of A1c variability, (b) develop and validate more intuitive clinical measures of A1c variability (i.e. %  time-in-range), and (c) assess the relationship between these measures of A1c variability and adverse health  outcomes in patients with diabetes. Specific objectives include: Objective 1. Construct statistical measures and determine the predictors of A1c variability. Objective 2. Develop and validate a more intuitive clinical measure of A1c variability defined as A1c time-in- range. We will calculate the percentage of days an individual has an A1c level in the appropriate range, based on clinical parameters and the VA-DoD clinical practice guidelines. Objective 3. Estimate the relationship between A1c variability, % time-in-range, and adverse health outcomes? including micro- and macrovascular complications and mortality. Project Methods: The proposed project is a retrospective observational study of secondary data from patient- level administrative and claims data from VA and Medicare. Utilization and pharmacy files will be used to determine patients diagnosed with diabetes between 2004 and 2015. A three-year baseline period will be used to calculate the individual A1c variability measure of coefficient of variation and a %time in range measure. The %time in range measure will be the percentage of days an individual has an A1c level in the appropriate range based on VA-DoD clinical practice guidelines. Patients will be assigned to the provider that orders the most A1c tests for them during the baseline period and provider A1c variability measures will be calculated. Provider A1c variability will be used as an instrumental variable to predict individual A1c variability, controlling for process quality (Objective 1, 2). Residuals will be captured from the equations estimated in these two objectives for Objective 3 to measure the effect of individual A1c variability on health outcomes. Significant relationships will then be further validated in a VA-Medicaid population.',\n",
       " \"Impact on veterans: Among Veterans with cancer, improved care coordination is an improvement of the patient experience. If we can increase our understanding of care coordination and how best measure it, we will have a new set of tools with which to monitor and meet the needs of the Veteran cancer population. Future system improvements can be evaluated based upon their consequences for care coordination. It is possible that an improved patient-provider experience of coordination may also increase timeliness and quality of care. Background: Many definitions of care coordination have been proposed. The authors of one systematic review combined common elements from many definitions to develop this working definition: Care coordination is the deliberate organization of patient care activities between two or more participants (including the patient) involved in a patient's care to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services.  From the patient perspective, coordination problems may be experienced as a lack of guidance, or unreasonable levels of effort on their part, in meeting care needs during transfers among different nodes in the health care system. Few instruments are available to measure cancer care coordination. Furthermore, prior instruments do not include items that address significant domains, including the establishment of accountability, the facilitation of transfers, and health information technology-enabled coordination. Finally, no instruments have been developed specific to cancer patients in the Veterans Health Administration who interrelate within an integrated delivery system where the phenomenon of care coordination may be experienced differently than elsewhere. Objective: The objective of the current proposal is to develop a measure with which to systematically measure cancer care coordination from the patient perspective: the Cancer Care Coordination Monitor (CCC-M). Our study group intends to test a future intervention, involving electronic health information exchange and services, which will directly target cancer care coordination among patients and providers. Emerging activities in cancer care are being targeted towards coordination. Due to the pervasiveness of coordination activities, having measures available that accurately and reliably capture the experience of coordination will be of great value in assessing the effect of these interventions. Key operational stakeholders who can make use of our findings include our VISN 11 and the VA National Program for Oncology Services. Methods: To develop the Cancer Care Coordination Monitor (CCC-M), we propose a mixed method study. First, semi-structured interviews with patients will be done to review prior coordination items and generate new items based upon missing conceptual domains, as well as unique Veteran patient experiences. Second, we will field a finalized instrument to test its validity and psychometric properties with the following approaches: (a) exploratory factor analysis to assess subscales and internal consistency, (b) test-retest processes to determine reliability, (c) concurrent predictive validity to assess correlation with continuity of care.\",\n",
       " \"Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with significant adverse health consequences including cardiovascular disease, motor vehicle accidents, daytime functional impairments and mortality risk. Although SDB is more common among men than women, it still impacts 17% of women in the general population. [Our preliminary evidence suggests it is even more common among women Veterans who receive VA care.] The recommended first-line therapy for most patients with SDB is positive airway pressure therapy (PAP). Published studies show that women have lower PAP adherence than men, particularly in the US, yet we are not aware of data comparing men and women Veterans. Because women Veterans experience significant sleep disturbance and other consequences of sleep disorders, adjusting to PAP therapy may be quite difficult. To date, studies have not tested interventions specifically designed to improve PAP adherence among women, accounting for important sleep-related and social factors.  Since 2010 we have been studying sleep disorders among women Veterans, initially focusing on insomnia disorder. Through this work we discovered that a significant segment of women served by VA also are high risk for sleep disordered breathing (SDB; also referred to as sleep apnea), particularly if they report poor sleep. In treating insomnia, we found that the initial discomfort created by traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (e.g. initial sleep restriction) is difficult for many women Veterans to tolerate. We developed and are now testing an insomnia intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), called ?Acceptance and the Behavioral Changes to Treat Insomnia? or ?ABC-I?. Within ACT, treatment focuses on a patient's values and reasons for implementing behavioral changes, and teaches the patient strategies for tolerating temporary discomfort in pursuit of goals consistent with one's values. We now propose to use these same therapeutic approach, adopted from ACT, to address unique challenges faced by women Veterans in adjusting to PAP therapy.  This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a program combining patient education with ACT-based techniques in improving adherence to PAP therapy, called ?ABC-SA? or ?Acceptance and the Behavioral Changes to treat Sleep Apnea.? This 6-session intervention will address initial discomfort, link treatment to the patient?s values and incorporate methods for accepting the changes that are required to treat SDB. Main study outcomes will be assessed 3 months after PAP initiation, and PAP adherence will be tracked remotely for 12 months. The 6-session ?control? intervention will account for the contact with a study interventionist and will be modeled after usual care.  The objectives of this proposal are: (1) to test the efficacy of the ABC-SA program in improving PAP adherence, compared to a control program modeled after usual care, for women Veterans with SDB; (2) to test the efficacy the ABC-SA program for improving objectively-measured and patient-reported sleep quality, compared to the control program; and (3), to test the efficacy the ABC-SA program for improving quality of life and symptoms of depression, compared to the control program. Data will be analyzed using ?intention to treat? principles, using appropriate statistical methods for clinical trials.\",\n",
       " 'Summary The project has historically studied the action of tumor suppressor genes, and is based on the premise that tumor suppressors reveal key regulatory nodes in growth control processes and the strategies nature uses to combat cancer. Based on our observation that certain oncogenes promote apoptosis through p53, we initially explored the mechanisms by which p53 suppressed apoptosis and how disruption of p53 network components promoted tumorigenesis and impacted therapy response. Taking advantage of program collaborations, we later established how p53 loss sustains tumorigenesis and, by combining oncogenomics, functional genomics, and in vivo genetic screens, established the functional relevance of many cancer drivers. Over the last funding cycle, we expanded our efforts towards understanding how tumor suppressor loss is required for tumor maintenance, showing that re-establishing tumor suppressor networks can have profound and distinct anti- proliferative effects, even in advanced cancers. This evolution spawned our current interest in ?tumor maintenance genes? ? genes needed to sustain cancer progression ? and stimulated the development of new mouse models that enable suppression and/or reactivation of gene function at different stages of disease. Moving forward, the project will focus on the identification and characterization of tumor suppressor and tumor maintenance genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) ? two primary liver cancers for which genomic studies have identified few ?druggable? cancer drivers, and for which no effective therapies exist. As such, we now propose to characterize how mutations in certain chromatin-modifying genes ? which are common in human tumors but are poorly understood - drive tumor initiation and maintenance, and to implement new genetic and genomic tools to identify and validate therapeutic targets for primary liver cancers driven by these altered gene products. Our approach combines mouse models, genetic tools, and cancer genomics in a coordinated manner that enables the comprehensive interrogation of tumor suppressor and tumor maintenance network, and benefits from multiple interactions with other projects and cores. The project will produce a more complete understanding of how primary liver cancers are initiated and maintained while simultaneously validating new therapeutic targets for these diseases. As such, our project addresses an urgent and unmet clinical need.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine repeat region in the Huntingtin protein. A paradox of Huntington's Disease is that mutant Huntingtin protein is ubiquitously expressed, but only a subset of central neurons are killed in this disease. That is, some cell types are able to tolerate mutant Huntingtin (mHtt) expression without significant toxicity. The proposed studies are designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which cells process and remove aggregated mHtt, allowing them to survive. It is generally accepted that misfolded proteins are first held by small heat shock proteins to be refolded, and directed to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) if they cannot be refolded. When the UPS system is overwhelmed, misfolded proteins are then believed to be retargeted to large protein aggregates (inclusion bodies). However, in this model the role of small fibrillar aggregates, which are now widely believed to be the toxic species of aggregate, is unclear. Previous imaging studies have overwhelmingly focused on inclusion bodies, partly because imaging technologies that could detect small aggregates were not widely available. Using S. cerevisiae, we are able to see both small aggregates and inclusions in the same cell. One model to explain how cells tolerate large amounts of misfolded mHtt would be that small aggregates, produced when the UPS is overwhelmed, join inclusion bodies that are then degraded by autophagy. The proposed studies are designed to test this model. While attention has shifted recently to small aggregate species as the likely cause of most cellular damage, imaging studies of SAS are uncommon. Our first goal is to use advanced imaging and analysis to track small aggregates with respect to the inclusion body, proteasome, and phagocytic compartments, using a genetically tractable system. Second, there is evidence to indicate that the conserved small heat shock protein Hsp42p facilitates mHtt aggregate removal. It has been suggestubiuthat the mammalian sHSP HspB8 acts with Hsp70, BAG3 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) in promoting autophagy of inclusion bodies. Our second aim is to test the hypothesis that Hsp42p directs inclusion bodies to autophagosomes, a novel function for small heat shock proteins. This work will allow us to define the dynamic behavior of small aggregate species, and develop new techniques to examine inclusion body recycling, using methods that can be used to identify specific molecular deficits in strains known to modulate mHtt processing. Critically, this pilot project will facilitate the development of the PI through mentorship and will support the establishment of an active lab that promotes research training and scientific collaboration.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary Pediatric cardiomyopathies encompass a heterogeneous group of disorders including dilated, hypertrophic, and less commonly, restrictive cardiomyopathies. Emerging experimental evidence and epidemiologic data suggest that the pediatric heart failure population is distinctly different from adult patients The most common cause of heart failure and reason for cardiac transplantation in children older than 1 year is dilated cardiomyopathy (DCAmong these etiologies, pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has an estimated 40% five year transplant-free survival and remains the most common diagnosis leading to heart transplant in children greater than 1 year of age. The central hypothesis is that circulating microRNAs (miRs) will be useful biomarkers for risk stratification, will correlate with outcomes and may represent novel therapeutic targets in children with DCM. The aims of this study are: 1) Determine the profile of circulating miRs in a cohort of children with DCM and acute systolic heart failure. The circulating miR expression patterns will then be stratified based on reaching a primary end-point by 1 year defined as: [1] death or transplantation, [2] recovery (normalization of ventricular size and function) or [3] stable DCM (persistent ventricular dilation or dysfunction); 2) Define the miR profile in a separate cohort of children with chronic, stable DCM to determine if those patients with stable DCM who progress to death/transplant within 1 year will be similar to the profile of the Aim 1 cohort of children with acute heart failure who also progress to death/transplant; and 3) Analyze the expression of circulating and heart tissue miRs in pediatric controls (non-failing donors whose heart could not be placed [NF]) and pediatric DCM patients. The results of this study could improve clinicians prognostic? assessment at diagnosis of DCM in children, improve decision-making regarding listing children for heart transplant as opposed to identifying those who are expected to recover ventricular function, and could provide insight into cellular mechanisms of disease and define novel targets for future treatment of DCM in children.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  My overarching goal is to become an independent investigator in the area of lifestyle interventions for prevention and reduction of cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF) in adults with spinal cord injury (SCI). The purpose of this application is to augment my previous training in obesity, behavioral science and research design with additional tools necessary to make this transition.  As a behavioral scientist, my research and clinical practice focus on lifestyle interventions for obesity. After completion of my doctorate in Health Education and Promotion, I completed a competitive T-32 fellowship in Comparative Effectiveness Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), with special focus on tailoring lifestyle interventions for specific populations. This training furthered my understanding of adapting interventions for specific needs of special populations and measuring the effectiveness of these interventions using randomized controlled trials and real world clinical trials. Throughout my doctoral and post-doctoral training, I also received clinical training in the UAB Department of Nutrition Sciences. In this clinical role, I learned nutritional and physical activity considerations for treating obesity in a variety of chronic diseases, as well as how to incorporate behavior change strategies to improve adherence to dietary and exercise recommendations. I also had the opportunity to work with individuals with a variety of physical disabilities including SCI. It was during this clinical training that I began to understand the barriers individuals with physical disabilities face in developing healthy dietary and activity routines, and the lack of evidenced-based recommendations for reducing obesity and other CMRF in this population.  To further my training, this career development award (CDA) will focus on three goals. First, I will increase my understanding of the unique disease processes associated with SCI that influence cardiometabolic risk factors after injury. Second, I will augment my current knowledge of psychosocial determinants of obesity with an increased understanding of the unique determinants of behavior change in adults with SCI. Third, I aim to increase my understanding of how to leverage emerging technology to develop novel interventions that can directly address barriers to adherence among adults with SCI. Completion of these training goals, along with the proposed study will put me in a position to apply for R01 level funding by the end of the CDA period.  Despite significant evidence on CMRF and obesity among adults with SCI, there is little evidence on the best methods for addressing these significant health issues. Lifestyle interventions consisting of diet and exercise recommendations along with behavioral strategies to increase adherence to these recommendations, are considered the first line of treatment for weight loss and reduction of CMRF, but little research has explored how to adapt these interventions for adults with SCI. Specifically, dietary adherence continues to be an obstacle to long term weight maintenance, and this may be compounded in adults with SCI given the metabolic, psychosocial and environmental barriers associated with this disability. Reduced carbohydrate (CHO) diets have been found to improve CMRF in non-SCI groups. They have also been associated with decreased hunger and cravings, and improved mood and energy levels, all of which may lead to improved dietary adherence. The purpose of the proposed study is to assess differences in dietary adherence, body composition and insulin, glucose, lipids and hs-CRP between a reduced CHO and standard diet in obese adults with SCI. This study will employ a novel home-based telehealth intervention utilizing an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) platform designed specifically for individuals with SCI.  I have developed an excellent mentoring team to guide this CDA. James Rimmer, PhD, will serve as primary mentor. Dr. Rimmer is internationally known for his work in exercise, health promotion and physical disabilities and currently serves as the inaugural UAB/Lakeshore Foundation Endowed Chair in Health Promotion and Rehabilitation Science. Barbara Gower, PhD will serve as co-mentor and will oversee my training in CMRF including trainings in measuring and interpreting body composition, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These mentors, along with consultants Kathleen Martin Ginis, PhD, Leslie McClure, PhD, and Yu-ying Chen, MD, PhD, will guide me through the proposed training program and ensure completion of the proposed study.  The resources afforded to me by my mentoring team and UAB are excellent. I will be involved in research and training in the UAB Departments of Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy, as well as the PhD program in Rehabilitation Science. Additionally, I will work closely with the UAB/Lakeshore Research Collaborative, which serves as a partnership between leading UAB researchers and state-of-the-art fitness and health promotion programs for people with physical disabilities.  In conclusion, my research and clinical experience make me an excellent candidate for the K01 Mentored Career Development Award in Medical Rehabilitation Research. I believe that the completion of the proposed training plan and study, in conjunction with guidance from an outstanding mentor team and the resources afforded to me by UAB offer an excellent opportunity to complete my transition to independent investigator.',\n",
       " \"The overarching goal of this proposal is to accelerate recruitment for clinical trials in a rare autoimmune disease, myositis, and to improve the current outcome measures for assessing treatment response by incorporating robust patient-reported outcomes and practical functional measures as metrics of response to future therapies. This approach addresses critical gaps in the conduct of myositis clinical trials: (1) Poor subject recruitment that geographically disenfranchises many myositis patients; (2) Lack of relevant patient-reported outcomes as a response metric to available therapies; and (3) Paucity of practical functional measures to longitudinally assess outcome in myositis patients with muscle weakness. Our goal is to establish a national cohort of myositis patients without geographic restriction using state-of-the-art technology (smart phone mobile applications and the web) coupled with tele-medicine techniques (tele-research) and to validate: (1) patient- reported metrics of PROMIS-physical function and (2) quantifiable metrics of functional outcome from physical activity monitors. Specific Aim 1 will establish the superiority of recruitment and enrollment of a tele-research cohort (TRC) compared to a myositis center-based cohort (CBC) while at the same time demonstrating that data collection and data integrity is uncompromised in the TRC compared to the CBC. This strategy can then be applied to future myositis clinical trials by enlisting the support of commercial laboratories for bio-specimen collection and mobile research units for drug delivery and trial monitoring activities. In addition, we have incorporated rigorous qualitative analysies to understand patients' perceptions and barriers towards myositis clinical trials using tele-research as compared to a center based approach. This will address key gaps in our knowledge and approach, ultimately leading to more effective and efficient clinical trial design in rare diseases. Specific Aim 2a will test the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of physical activity monitors as a novel functional and objective outcome measure in future myositis trials and Specific Aim 2b will address the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of PROMIS-physical function computer adaptive testing and the efficiency gained over the current patient-reported measures employed in myositis observational studies and clinical trials. The University of Pittsburgh Myositis Center has an excellent track record of successful observational studies and clinical trials and our preliminary data demonstrates the feasibility, capability, and proof of concept for all of the proposed measures. We have an established team of investigators with experience in myositis clinical trials, outcome measures along with expertise in qualitative analysis, website design and management, PROMIS and physical activity monitors. All of our data is stored in a robust prospective database that incorporates patient consenting, all forms of data entry and analysis, a modular approach to experimental protocols, and data extraction and analysis capabilities. The knowledge gained from the proposal will be invaluable to any future clinical trial in myositis.\",\n",
       " 'Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication of medical and surgical diseases that has significant attributable morbidity and mortality in critically ill Veterans. Analysis of Veterans Health Administrative data reported that Veterans who develop AKI during a hospitalization are at substantial risk for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) within 1 year. Numerous therapeutic interventions have been evaluated in clinical trials to overcome this significant clinical challenge, with none proven successful. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill this gap in knowledge by discovering new targets that could be exploited for therapeutic interventions in AKI.  The lymphatic system is crucial for maintaining fluid balance, transporting lipids, and aiding in immune function. During pathological conditions that involve inflammation such as would occur in AKI and the AKI to CKD transition, these functions of the lymphatic system are further accentuated. Inflammation induces lymphangiogenesis through expression of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), particularly VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and their receptor VEGF-R3. New lymphatic vessels can then aid in transition of inflammatory cells, removing the cellular debris from the microenvironment of inflammation-induced injury, draining the excess fluid and ultimately facilitating tissue repair. While recent studies have shown lymphangiogenesis to be an active participant in a number of inflammatory diseases, very little is known about the role of the lymphatic system and more importantly, lymphangiogenesis, in the pathogenesis of AKI and the AKI to CKD transition. Our preliminary data demonstrate a significant upregulation of lymphangiogenic markers along with increased lymphatic vessel density during AKI. Our central hypothesis is that inflammation associated lymphangiogenesis (IAL), regulated by VEGF-C expression in myeloid and proximal tubule cells, is involved in the resolution of inflammation following AKI and the AKI to CKD transition. The aims of this proposal are designed to 1) determine how lymphangiogenesis modulates AKI; 2) determine how lymphangiogenesis affects the AKI to CKD transition; and 3) determine the cross-talk between the proximal tubule and myeloid cells in regulating lymphangiogenesis, inflammation, and AKI. Successful completion of the aims of this project will help elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AKI during both injury and the recovery phases and have the potential to provide new avenues for therapeutic interventions in AKI.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract:  More than 30 years after the discovery of HIV, there are still no vaccines or microbicides to prevent HIV infection. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is successful in suppressing virus replication, but it does not clear the virus, offers only partial immunologic recovery, and requires lifelong adherence. A better understanding of basic HIV?host cell interactions is needed to develop new strategies to prevent HIV infection. This proposed study seeks to investigate the interplay of HIV with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and helper CD4 T (Th) cells in the presence of anti-HIV antibodies (Abs) that retard virus spread to Th cells.  CD4 Th cells are the main cell type infected by HIV, but not all Th cells are equally vulnerable. As compared with Th1 cells, Th17 cells are preferentially targeted by HIV, in part due to higher expression of HIV envelope (Env) receptors, including ?4?7. Our recent studies showed that Th17 cells are also preferentially targeted by HIV transmitted from APCs. However, different outcomes arise from HIV interactions with Th cells and distinct APCs. HIV-exposed monocytes efficiently transmit virus to Th17 cells while stimulating Th proliferation, resulting in expansion in the number of infected Th17 cells. In contrast, virus transmission from HIV-exposed monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) causes the number of Th17 cells to decline. Further, we observed that in the immunological synapses between Th cells and APCs, HIV Env enhances Th cell activation by acting like a co-stimulatory molecule. Th cells thus co-stimulated become more permissive to HIV infection.  HIV Env is the key determinant that regulates virus transmission to Th cells and cellular activation of target Th cells. HIV transmission varies depending on Env co-receptor tropisms (CCR5 vs CXCR4) and is sensitive to interference by anti-Env Abs. HIV-induced enhancement of Th cell activation also is triggered by Env and suppressed by anti-Env Abs. On the basis of these findings, we propose to further investigate the HIV Env determinants influencing the efficiency of virus transmission from APCs to Th cells. Our hypothesis is that HIV utilizes the intimate cell-cell contact between APCs and Th cells to spread to Th cells and also to enhance Th cell activation, rendering them more permissive for virus replication, through the action of the virus Env. Therefore, anti-Env Abs, by forming immune complexes with HIV virions, may alter APC-Th cell interactions to blunt virus transmission and replication.  To test these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will define HIV Env determinants that are essential for efficient transmission from APCs to Th cells. Monocytes and MDDCs treated with HIV will be tested as APCs in a co- culture system to stimulate Th1 and Th17 cells and transmit viruses with distinct Envs. The Env variables to be evaluated include co-receptor usage, N-glycan sugar composition, and affinity for ?4?7 and mannose-binding receptors. Aim 2 is to evaluate the ability of anti-Env Abs to retard virus transmission from APCs to Th cells. We will test neutralizing and nonneutralizing monoclonal Abs specific for distinct epitopes, and polyclonal Abs generated by Env epitope-targeted vaccines. Fc-mediated activities of the Abs will also be assessed. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test HIV transmission from APCs in vivo, using the humanized mouse model. Anti-Env Abs with inhibitory activity in vitro will also be evaluated in the mouse model. The proposed experiments will generate data to inform future development of more effective prophylactic agents against HIV.',\n",
       " 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant contributor to recalcitrant multi-drug resistant infections especially in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients. Multi-drug and totally drug resistant strains of P. aeruginosa are increasing threats that contribute to high mortality in these patients (1, 2). Hence there is an urgent need to develop new strategies to combat P. aeruginosa and other resistant pathogens. The pathogenic profile of P. aeruginosa is related to its ability to secrete a variety of virulence factors and promote biofilm formation. Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism wherein P. aeruginosa secretes small diffusible molecules, specifically acyl homo serine lactones (AHL) such as 3O-C12-HSL that promote inter-bacterial communication, virulence, and biofilm formation (3, 4). Strategies that strengthen the ability of the host to inhibit these virulence factors would enhance host defenses and improve treatment. Over the previous funding cycle, we examined how lipid mediators regulate the lung host innate immune response to P. aeruginosa virulence factors (5-8). Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we discovered that prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), a product of L-PGD synthase, and its downstream metabolite, 15d-PGJ2, stimulate host response to P. aeruginosa (9-11). Further, we found that these immune-stimulatory effects are dependent on the nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?), a ligand-activated transcription factor with a wide spectrum of biological functions that includes metabolism, inflammation and redox balance (12).  Our preliminary data provide novel evidence that P. aeruginosa (strain PAO1) QS genes and molecules induce select miRNAs (including miR-27a and miR-130a) which reduce PPAR? levels in host cells? Furthermore treatment with PPAR? agonists induces host expression of paraoxonase 2 (PON-2), a mitochondrial enzyme with lactonase activity that hydrolyzes QS molecules. Induction of PON-2 inhibits biofilm formation by PAO1 on epithelial cells, improves epithelial integrity and enhances clearance of PAO1 in mouse lungs through inhibition of QS effects on cells. These findings support the novel hypothesis that P. aeruginosa evades host defenses by inhibiting PPAR? and downstream immunomodulatory effectors in host cells and that pharmacological PPAR? activation provides a complementary therapeutic approach to the treatment of P.aeruginosa infection.  This hypothesis will be examined in three interrelated specific aims: 1) Investigate the molecular mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa attenuates expression of PPAR?. miRs-27a and 130a, as post- transcriptional mechanisms will be interrogated to define the molecular underpinnings as to how QS systems attenuate PPAR? in host cells. 2) Determine the mechanisms by which PPAR? enhances immune defenses. PON-2 knockout or overexpressing lung epithelial cells infected with PAO1 and treated with PPAR? agonists or antagonists will further define the link between PON-2 induction and PPAR? functional effects. Analysis of tight junction proteins and biofilm formation will determine the functional impact of PPAR? on P. aeruginosa infected cells. 3) Define the impact of PPAR? modulation in P. aeruginosa lung infection in vivo. PPAR? activation will be accomplished using a currently available PPAR? agonist (pioglitazone), in mice infected intra-nasally with PAO1 and its mutants lacking QS systems.  The goal of this proposal is to define novel molecular approaches to stimulate immune response to virulent pathogens e.g. P. aeruginosa. Since pioglitazone is an FDA approved PPAR? agonist used in management of patients with type II diabetes, the results from these studies can be readily translated to human clinical trials. Completion of the proposed work will have fundamentally important implications and a major impact on the management of patients with resistant P. aeruginosa infections and will lay the ground work for testing therapies to treat difficult infections in human trials.',\n",
       " 'Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of the majority of cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction, strokes, and heart failure leading to tremendous morbidity and mortality worldwide. Risk factor modification such as reductions in hyperlipidemia and hypertension constitute the only treatment strategy available for this vexing disease. Thus, there is an active effort to identify the culprit cellular processes that provide mechanistic insight. Reports of the pro-atherogenic phenotype of mice with a macrophage-specific autophagy deficiency has renewed interest in the role of the autophagy-lysosomal system in atherosclerosis. Lysosomes have the unique role of processing both exogenous material such as excess atherogenic lipids and endogenous cargo that includes dysfunctional proteins and organelles. Indeed, this is a primary mechanism by which macrophages can degrade excess lipids and cytotoxic materials present in the atherosclerotic plaque. Various lines of evidence demonstrate a progressive dysfunction in the autophagy-lysosome system of plaque macrophages suggesting that attempts at reprogramming the degradative capacity of macrophages might be a fruitful therapeutic area. Our work with TFEB, the predominant transcription factor regulating autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis, shows that enhancing TFEB function in macrophages leads to reductions in atherosclerosis of mice. In an attempt to harness this pathway therapeutically, we have uncovered a safe and natural sugar called trehalose, able to induce TFEB and autophagy-lysosome biogenesis in macrophages and recapitulate the atheroprotective properties. This raises the prospect of this sugar as a novel and practical therapy. In specific aim 1, we will dissect the mechanisms linking trehalose to macrophage autophagy- lysosomal biogenesis. In specific aim 2, we will determine the predominant autophagic processes in macrophages that underlie trehalose?s ability to reduce atherosclerosis. A major impediment to the therapeutic use of trehalose is degradation by the enzyme trehalase, present in higher organisms including mammals. In specific aim 3, genetic and pharmacological techniques of inhibiting trehalase will be used to determine if trehalose?s effects can be synergized. This proposal will test the hypothesis that trehalose can harness macrophage autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis to treat atherosclerosis.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract: Spinal cord injury (SCI) produces a permanent loss of function below the level of damage. In addition, more than 80% of SCI patients report the development of horribly debilitating neuropathic pain (NP) that further robs the individual of life quality. NP can be an almost constant pathological companion for these individuals and represents a significant cause of suicide in the chronic SCI population. Unfortunately, there are few therapeutic options available to treat NP with a low percentage of individuals reporting treatment efficacy. One possible explanation for the low number of effective treatment options is our poor understanding of the mechanisms that initiate and potentially maintain NP in chronic SCI. Inflammation represents one possible mechanism to elicit NP in the days to weeks following SCI. However, inflammation has previously been considered to be transient, with mechanisms maintaining chronic NP unclear. Our published research suggests, however, that inflammation can be detected long after the initial injury in a clinically-relevant model of rat SCI. We detect the presence of inflammatory metabolites of arachidonic acid, particularly prostaglandins and leukotrienes, produced by cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes, respectively. FDA-approved non-steroidal inflammatory (NSAIDs) drugs such as ibuprofen have been tried as analgesics for SCI-NP, but are ineffective. Our detection of elevated intraspinal prostaglandins AND leukotrienes suggests a possible explanation for the failure of ?over the counter? NSAIDs in treating NP. Studies have shown that the targeting of only one metabolic pathway, for instance, the cyclooxygenase pathway that generates prostaglandins, results in a ?shunting? of the arachidonic acid into the sister lipoxygenase pathway that produced leukotrienes; the end result being a net ?gain? of pro-inflammatory mediators (in this specific example, increased leukotrienes). We demonstrated that delayed treatment with a novel dual inhibitor of both cyclooxygenase AND 5-lipoxygenase enzymes successfully reduced NP in rats with chronic SCI. We subsequently demonstrated that this experimental drug reduced both prostaglandins and leukotrienes if administered in the acute phase of injury, resulting in significant locomotor recovery. Unfortunately, this drug is not FDA-approved. Our current goal is to test combinations of FDA- approved inhibitors of cyclooxygenase AND 5-lipoxygenase to determine: 1) if combinations of these two classes of inhibitors are as effective at treating or permanently blocking chronic NP as the previously tested experimental dual-inhibitory drug, and 2) whether such treatment resolves the chronic pro-inflammatory state as evidenced by reduced prostaglandin and leukotriene biosynthesis. As the FDA-approval process can require decades to move a drug from bench to bedside, the effective translation of already-FDA-approved drugs to new tasks, such as the treatment of neuropathic pain could significantly reduce time needed for subsequent clinical evaluation and use. Targeting prostaglandin AND leukotriene production to treat chronic NP with FDA-approved inhibitors would represent a novel therapeutic approach and would represent a critical advancement in care for the chronic SCI community.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Fish oil, a rich source of marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (MO3PUFAs), is the most popular natural product used by U.S. adults. Substantial data support the beneficial effect of MO3PUFAs on colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention and treatment. However, the specific mechanisms through which MO3PUFAs influence CRC are not well understood. Increasing evidence supports a pivotal role of gut microbes in integrating dietary cues with host immunity and potentially mediating the anticancer effect of MO3PUFAs. Dietary fat composition is a major driver of the gut microbial community structure. Mice fed with a high-MO3PUFA diet demonstrate increased abundance of the gut bacteria that support the host immunoprotective system and improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera, and decreased abundance of the microbes that dampen antitumor immunity, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, which has been shown to promote CRC by generating a tumor-permissive microenvironment. Taken together with my recent findings that the anti-CRC effect of MO3PUFAs is related to the tumor immune microenvironment, these data aggregately support the hypothesis that MO3PUFAs modulate the gut microbial composition and function to shape the gut immune response and suppress CRC. To test this hypothesis, I will first leverage three large prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I and II and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), to characterize the gut microbial signature associated with long-term high intake of MO3PUFAs and assess whether certain microbes mediate the protective effect of MO3PUFAs on CRC incidence and survival. To establish causality, I will then bridge the observations to the clinic through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in patients with prior adenoma by investigating the effect of MO3PUFA supplements on the gut microbiome, metabolome, and gene expression profiling in the colon. This innovative project will advance our understanding about the interplay between MO3PUFAs, gut microbiota, and host immunity in CRC. I am well suited to perform this research based on 1) my expertise in nutrition, epidemiology, quantitative methods, and biomarker research; 2) the exceptional multidisciplinary mentoring team comprised of leaders in their respective fields; and 3) the unparalleled research environment to support my career development. Through this study, I will expand my expertise in several new areas, including the gut microbiome, bioinformatics, and design and conduct of biomarker-based RCT. The proposed research and training will help achieve my long- term career goal to become an independent investigator, and develop a transdisciplinary research program in the gut microbiome and human nutrition for cancer prevention through integration of population-based epidemiologic study with patient-oriented clinical investigation. The findings yielded from my research will uncover new biological mechanisms relating diet to carcinogenesis, and identify novel biomarkers or targets that can be effectively translated into the clinic to improve cancer prevention and treatment.\",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Infections caused by MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative pathogens challenge clinicians to find safe and effective antibiotic regimens that can eradicate these opportunistic pathogens from the frail, often immunocompromised hosts that they target. Two features of the P. aeruginosa cell envelope - its limited permeability to small molecules and the large number of both constitutive and inducible efflux systems it contains - render this pathogen intrinsically resistant to many available antimicrobials and contribute to acquired resistance toward the small set of existing anti-Pseudomonal antibiotics. This seriously limits the ability to identify ?hits? with antibiotic activity using whole-cell assays - as compounds that penetrate and can inhibit key metabolic pathways are often effluxed out before they measurably inhibit bacterial growth or viability. Approaches that identify novel small molecule inhibitors of key bacterial enzymes often fail when these small molecules cannot achieve effective intrabacterial concentrations - and our understanding of the chemistries that would allow for penetration and retention is woefully incomplete. In this application we use a diverse array of riboswitches, sensitive and specific RNA-based small molecule sensors, as rapid and quantitative indicators that bacterial physiology has been perturbed. By multiplexing several riboswitches that report on accumulation of the alarmones ZTP and ppGpp, as well as the toxic product of increased SAM utilization, SAH, we can effectively screen for ?signatures? of a bacterial response to sub- MIC levels of small molecules. Our approach places these riboswitch reporters in isogenic MDR and efflux- deficient P. aeruginosa strains, simultaneously yielding information about both physical and structural chemical features that allow penetration and efflux-avoidance and identifying ?hit? molecules that can be developed as leads for new antibacterial agents. Our medicinal chemistry approach will build on both types of knowledge, allowing novel anti-Pseudomonal compounds to be identified and optimized.',\n",
       " 'Summary  Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes major health problems with increasing incidence in endemic regions. Dengue fever, caused by any of the four DENV serotypes (DENV1-4), initially presents with non-specific symptoms of febrile illnesses, thus clinical diagnosis is often inaccurate. Early accurate diagnosis is important to monitor patients for severe complications due to internal hemorrhage and shock, which can be fatal without appropriate clinical management. Current DENV diagnostic methods either require specialized laboratory facilities, or have poor sensitivity in the acute phase. Antibody detection in the convalescent phase has poor specificity due to cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) provides high sensitivity and specificity, but current technologies are incompatible with peripheral low resource healthcare facilities that serve the majority of affected patients. The goal of this R21 project is to develop an initial prototype for a portable, inexpensive, robust, easy to use, integrated nucleic acid testing device consisting of a disposable cartridge and an inexpensive, compact, battery operated instrument that enables early, rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnosis of acute DENV infection. We have already developed such an integrated prototype device for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis from sputum. For diagnosis of DENV infection from whole blood, we have established proof of principle for processes required during sample preparation, amplification, and detection. Through the proposed project, we will further develop and optimize these processes, and then incorporate them into a cartridge and instrument prototype that leverages components of our existing NAAT device, but in a simpler format. Aim 1 entails optimization of processes for plasma separation, sample preparation, reverse transcription coupled to isothermal loop-mediated amplification (RT-LAMP), and visual lateral flow-based detection. In Aim 2 we will develop a prototype cartridge and instrument that integrates and automates these processes. Using the prototype device, we will demonstrate detection of all four DENV serotypes spiked into whole blood. Successful completion of this project entails demonstrating that the device can detect DENV1-4 in blood with limit of detection comparable to the FDA-cleared DENV1-4 real time RT-PCR assay developed by the Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC). In future efforts, once feasibility has been established, we will advance the initial prototype to a final version of the device, conduct full analytical validation and a field evaluation study, with the goal to obtain FDA clearance. Our long term goal is also to expand the multiplexing capabilities to enable differential diagnosis of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Every year there are an estimated 7.9 million children born with a serious birth defect and 3.3 million of these are children under five years of age who die from factors related to their birth defect. Comprehensive, reliable data on birth defects are not available for most developing countries. In many resource-poor settings, the baseline prevalence of birth defects is not known and systematic monitoring for birth defects is difficult or non- existent. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) in pregnancy can maximally reduce the risk of vertical transmission of HIV, and therefore it is recommended that all pregnant women with HIV receive effective ART regimens to prevent the transmission of HIV to their infants. However, there have been concerns about the possibility of women on ART at conception or during the first trimester having an increased risk of delivering an infant with a birth defect. The goal of this proposal is to establish a birth defect hospital based surveillance program in Kampala, Uganda and to determine the prevalence of major external birth defects and association of maternal risk factors including antiretroviral therapy to these defects. Four hospitals in Kampala, Uganda will be included in the surveillance system with approximately 48,000 deliveries per year. Informative births (live and stillborn) regardless of gestational age that are born at the four hospitals will be included in the surveillance project for a duration of five years. Informative births are those in which the newborn is formed well enough to ascertain whether or not there is a birth defect. Each newborn will be examined as soon as possible after birth. Infant measurements (weight, head circumference and length) will be obtained and all newborns will be examined for major external birth defects by trained midwives. Newborns with major external birth defects will be photographed after obtaining consent and the photographs will be used to classify the diagnosis. As needed, the photos and verbatim descriptions will be sent to birth defect experts for confirmation of diagnoses and for coding of the birth defect using ICD-10 disease classification criteria. Demographic information, HIV status and obstetric information (parity status, previous live and still births, presence of physical defects of births of previous children) will be collected for all mothers. Every mother of an infant identified with a major external birth defect of interest will be asked to participate in a case-control study. Three controls will be selected for each case matched on hospital of delivery. After consenting, each mother will be asked to respond to questions regarding, types of medications taken during pregnancy including antiretroviral drugs and cotrimoxazole, medical history and more detailed demographic information. The surveillance program will provide crucial current data on the baseline prevalence of birth defects in Uganda while the case-control study will allow examination of the possible effects of antiretroviral treatment on infant outcomes while also screening for other common known causes of birth defects.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goals of the Cancer Cell Biology Program are: (i) to understand, at the molecular and cellular levels, mechanisms underlying tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and resistance to therapeutic treatment, and (ii) to identify and validate new targets for cancer therapy. Insight derived from these studies, when integrated with research and development from other programs, will provide targets and guidance for the development of strategies for therapeutic intervention of cancer. Toward these two goals, the Program faculty investigates various aspects of cancer cell biology, including growth factors and receptors; angiogenesis and vascular biology; apoptosis; cell cycle regulation; chromatin biochemistry and transcriptional regulation; cell microstructure and function; DNA replication and repair; metabolism; regulatory RNA; and signal transduction. Led by two co-leaders with complementary expertise, Yue Xiong and James Bear, the program organizes these different areas into four major research themes: (1) Cell Cycle, (2) Cell Signaling, (3) Cell Movement and Organization, and (4) Epigenetics and Chromatin Biology. The major emphasis of the Program is to foster integrated research that spans these inter-related themes, enhancing the research and translational capabilities of program investigators through the establishment, expansion and utilization of appropriate core facilities, and promoting interactions with investigators from other LCCC basic, clinical and population sciences programs.         The Cancer Cell Biology Program consists of 45 members who are associated with 7 basic science and 4 clinical departments at UNC-Chapel Hill. During the last funding period, program members have published 644 cancer-related articles (30% collaborative). In 2014, our program members held 101 grants and $27.3M (total cost) in annual extramural funding, including 24 grants and $5.8M (total costs) from the NCI.',\n",
       " 'From parent R01 ? R01GM113001 Project Summary  A critical aspect of gonad development is the formation of the male and female gonad stem cell niches. Both germline and somatic stem cells are required for continuous production of differentiated progeny for gametogenesis, while their surrounding microenvironments, or ?niches?, control gonad stem cell division, maintenance, and their transition into differentiation. However, gonad stem cells and their niches are very different in males and females, with distinct regulatory control and very different outcomes (sperm vs. eggs). Further, in some species, such as mammals, a clear stem cell population exists only in males, but not in females, resulting in a more limited reproductive potential in females. This proposal aims to understand the mechanisms governing sex-specific development of the gonad stem cell niche. It addresses fundamental aspects of the biology of sex determination that also have clear implications for stem cell biology and human reproductive health.  Although the mechanisms that initiate sex determination vary tremendously in different animal species, it is now appreciated that a single family of transcription factors, the ?Doublesex, Mab3 Related Transcription Factors? (DMRTs), controls sexual dimorphism in the gonads of most or all animal species, including flies and humans. How these transcription factors dictate the differences between male and female gonad stem cell niches is not yet understood. In this proposal, we will investigate how the founding member of the DMRT family, Drosophila doublesex (dsx), controls sexual dimorphism in the gonad stem cell niche.',\n",
       " 'Background: VA performance monitoring makes extensive use of diagnosis-based quality measures that track delivery of care only among patients who have qualifying ICD-9 diagnosis codes. Diagnosis-based measures can be calculated using existing VA data, allowing for low-cost, near real-time performance monitoring. However, diagnosis-based measures can have critical validity problems if the targeted condition is under- or over-diagnosed to differing degrees across facilities. When variation is diagnosing and coding occurs, facility rankings on measured performance can be misleading: High performing facilities can score poorly, low performing facilities can score well, and facilities with the same real performance can fall at opposite ends of the facility rank distribution. Use of diagnosis-based process measures can therefore undermine one of the primary purposes of quality measurement: The comparison of facilities and systems. In addition, diagnosis- based measures cannot be used to detect gaps in access to care for patients who have a targeted condition but no qualifying diagnosis code. Finally, when diagnosis rates vary across patient subgroups, diagnosis-based measures cannot be used to detect and act on healthcare disparities. Problems with diagnosis-based measures could be remedied if true prevalence data were available: Comparisons of performance based on diagnosis- versus prevalence-based measures would detect facilities with anomalous diagnosis rates and distinguish variation in true performance from variation in case-finding. However, for many conditions, the electronic health record (EHR) does not contain data on true prevalence. Objectives: The goal of the proposed project is to develop a general method for improving diagnosis-based measures when valid prevalence data are not readily available. We propose to build a model for predicting prevalence using multiple sources of existing data and to validate it through a one-time collection of gold standard outcome data (survey-based SUD prevalence). Leveraging existing data with targeted collection of model development and validation data is a cost-effective strategy to improve diagnosis-based measures without requiring ongoing, expensive disease surveillance. Focusing on substance use disorder (SUD) care as an example, the objectives of this study are to: (a) assess the degree of SUD under- or over-diagnosis by comparing the proportion of patients with coded SUD diagnoses in the VA administrative data to SUD prevalence estimates obtained using a validated measure in a patient survey conducted at 30 VA healthcare systems; (b) refine and validate a model for predicting SUD prevalence among VA patients using multiple existing data sources; and (c) assess disparities in SUD diagnosis by comparing diagnosis rates to survey- based SUD prevalence estimates across patient age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups. Methods: We will collect data on DSM-IV and DSM-5-concordant SUD among VA patients using a validated instrument. We will conduct telephone interviews with patients at 30 VA healthcare systems selected based on geographic region and expected differences between observed SUD diagnosis and true SUD prevalence. We will compare observed diagnosis rates to survey-based prevalence estimates. We will refine a prototype SUD prediction model using as inputs population SUD surveillance data for Veterans from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health, EHR data from VA Corporate Data Warehouse, and organizational survey data from the VA Drug and Alcohol Program Survey. The model will be developed and validated using survey-based SUD prevalence as the outcome. We will fit the model using traditional methods and more modern machine learning algorithms and will select a final model based on established criteria for predictive validity. We will compute facility performance rankings using diagnosis rates versus predicted prevalence to assess the extent to which variation in performance may reflect variation in diagnosis or coding. Finally, we will assess possible disparities in diagnosing by comparing the gap between diagnosis and estimated prevalence across patient groups.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Work-related injuries and illnesses (WRIIs) continue to be a significant public health problem in Massachusetts. Surveillance of WRII is essential to effectively allocate limited prevention resources and monitor progress in meeting prevention goals. Workers' compensation (WC) claim records are an important source of information about WRII sustained by workers across a range of industries, WRIIs, and worker populations. However, their utility in providing information for action to protect workers has yet to be fully realized. The overarching aim of the proposed project is to reduce the incidence of WRII among Massachusetts workers by maximizing the state's capacity to use available WC data to conduct surveillance and promote prevention. The intent is to create sustained improvements in the WC data system and develop methods to generate actionable information for preventing WRII on an ongoing basis. Specific Aims are to: 1) develop, implement, and document protocols for assigning standardized codes to key data elements, essential for surveillance; 2) compare use of alternative sources of statewide employment data in conjunction with WC claim data to generate statewide WRII rates and recommend the most appropriate denominator for ongoing use; and explore approaches to generating local area WRII rates to inform community health planning and practice; 3) prepare a technical evaluation report assessing completeness, usefulness and limitations of the current WC database and denominator data source, with recommendations for WC data system improvements; 4) analyze three years WC claim data and prepare and disseminate a descriptive report of WRII in Massachusetts that identifies health and safety priorities; and 5) increase opportunities for integrative WRII prevention and compensation research. This study will be a multi-agency effort of the Massachusetts Departments of Public Health (lead agency), Industrial Accidents and Labor Standards that leverages resources and expertise within each agency. These Departments have a successful history of working together to protect the health of Massachusetts workers; the state infrastructure for occupational safety and health will be further strengthened by this new collaboration. An interagency study research team will be established. The work will be guided by an advisory group of nationally recognized WC experts and input from the Massachusetts Occupational Health and Safety Team (MOHST) an interagency working group that coordinates activities to improve worker health and safety in the state.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY The vast majority of perinatal hepatitis B (HB) infections become chronic infections, causing cirrhosis and liver cancer in adulthood. More than 250 million people (about 6% of the world's population) are chronically infected with HB virus (HBV), causing nearly 780,000 deaths each year. Universal HB immunization, starting with a birth dose of vaccine, is not sufficient to prevent all mother-to-child transmission, especially when mothers have high viral loads. In such cases, administration of HB immune globulin (HBIg) is recommended in addition to vaccine. In three studies, including a randomized clinical trial (iTAP) conducted by our group in Thailand, no transmissions occurred when mothers received an anti-HBV antiviral treatment at the end of pregnancy and early postpartum period. Maternal antiviral treatment decreases viral loads to those levels seen in mothers who seldom transmit the virus. In these studies, the antiviral treatment was safe and well tolerated by the mothers and infants. We hypothesize that HBIg can be replaced by maternal antiviral treatment for infants vaccinated at birth. Our primary objective is to demonstrate that, when mothers with high viremia who receive antiviral prophylaxis and when the newborn does not receive HBIg, the risk of HBV transmission to infants is less than 2%, the lowest rate of transmission ever reported without antiviral. This is relevant to public health given that HBIg is not widely available and most infants born to HBV infected mothers do not receive it and that HBIg plus vaccine administered at birth cannot prevent all infections, especially those already established in utero. This innovative strategy has never been tested in a carefully controlled setting. We propose a multicenter, open-label, single arm, prospective clinical study in infants born to mothers with high viremia (HBe antigen positive) who receive the antiviral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) from 28-30 weeks gestation until 2 months postpartum, while infants receive active immunization but no HBIg. The study will be conducted in Thailand and Laos PDR and will enroll 439 women and their infants in 32 sites of our clinical research network. HBsAg positive women will be enrolled if they have an HBeAg positive test (a widely available test of high virus replication). Mothers will be followed until one year postpartum and infants 18 months. The primary endpoint will be the detection of HBsAg confirmed by PCR detection of HBV DNA at six months of life. Demonstrating that antiviral treatment plus vaccine is sufficient to prevent virtually all perinatal HBV transmissions without the use of HBIg would revolutionize HBV PMTCT. The results of the study will help define policy to manage HBV infected pregnant women with an HBeAg positive test to prevent perinatal transmission.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary: Hopkins Clinical Center for Pulmonary Vascular Disease Phenomics Program The Hopkins Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) program is composed of a highly dedicated, multi-disciplinary group of experts from various institutional divisions and departments, who have a long history of close interaction and rich productivity within the framework of current and previous NIH-supported research projects. Our Program primarily provides comprehensive management of patients from all five groups of the PH World Classification, and also has a long history of participation in industry-sponsored as well as NIH-sponsored multicenter clinical trials for PH treatment. Since right ventricular (RV) function is the main determinant of death in PH, we propose thorough phenotyping of PH patients with a primary focus on the complex relationship between the RV and the pulmonary vasculature (PV) and RV-PV uncoupling, with the goal to further examine their crucial impact on morbidity and mortality in PH. Leveraging our extensive clinical knowledge in PH and our expertise in molecular and diagnostic pulmonary medicine and cardiology, we propose to use 1) echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) to identify non-invasive measures of RV performance and their capacity to predict outcomes; 2) invasive hemodynamic assessment of RV/PV interaction for its impact on deep phenotyping and survival; and 3) molecular (genomics, genetics, and serum biomarkers) for endophenotyping. The search for clinical, hemodynamic, imaging, serum and genetic biomarkers proposed in this application can be readily applied to all clinical centers in the context of the PVDOMICs as relevant variables for disease risk assessment, dynamic phenotyping (baseline and in response to treatment), endophenotyping, and as intermediate or primary outcomes in clinical trials. In summary, while the choice of parameters, studies and target populations will be left to the discretion of the DCC, our PH clinical center will offer the unique expertise of a multidisciplinary and highly integrated team of experts in this new endeavor to redefine PH phenotypes from all five groups of PH, thus ensuring success of the PVDOMICs efforts.',\n",
       " \"ABSTRACT  Exercise is a powerful physiological stimulus contributing to disease prevention and intervention. The protective and preventive effects of exercise are well-documented for metabolic, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. While scientists acknowledge the extensive benefits of exercise, there is still insufficient understanding about the underlying mechanisms by which exercise prevents disease and improves health across diverse organ systems. The NIH Common Fund has developed a forward-looking funding mechanism ? six tethered RFA's tied to creating a research consortium, the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) ? to create resources and critical information for exercise and health investigators well into the future. Two products of the MoTrPAC collective efforts will be a publically available data resource that will enhance and accelerate subsequent mechanistic research on diseases and conditions affected by physical activity; and a biorepository of clinical and animal model samples to be used in studying exercise biology. Based on prior collaborative efforts, our group believes that we are ideally positioned to propose a protocol that will respond directly to the RFA, while at the same time execute the large volume of tests to complete the ~450 people required at each site within the MoTrPAC consortium. To accomplish all of our Clinical Center goals, we have developed a consortium ? the North Carolina Clinical Site Consortium (NCCSC). The NCCSC consists of the experienced research teams Duke University School of Medicine; East Carolina University (ECU); and Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM). As described in the study plan, the NCCSC weighed a number of alternatives for training regimens, timing, and type of tissue sampling, sample sizes for the four obligated study groups, and other factors, while staying within budget constraints. The following Aims will maximize the value of the data and sample repositories; this will be accomplished with the enrollment of 540 individuals and finishing 450.  Â· Aim 1: To determine the response of molecular transducers to a single acute bout of either aerobic or  resistance training.  Â· Aim 2: To determine the responses of molecular transducers to a chronic exercise training program of  either aerobic or resistance training.  Â· Aim 3: To determine the responses of molecular transducers to a detraining period following either aerobic  or resistance training.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, analysis is often limited to a single tissue or performed using subjective scoring systems. We propose advanced three-dimensional MRI methods as well as advanced analysis tools to quantitatively study the spatial and temporal progression of OA across different tissues in the knee joint. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in multiple tissues of the entire joint over time. This project aims to develop 3D imaging tools based on MRI to sensitively track changes of OA in all joint tissues simultaneously. Our specific aims are to (1 develop a robust ultra-short echo time based quantitative DESS method to obtain high-resolution 3D maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2 and T2* in multiple joint tissues, (2) Improve the signal and resolution of whole-joint sodium MRI at 3T using a novel phased array coil, (3) Develop and validate novel 3D analysis tools that will allow us to quantify changes in knee joint tissues spatially and over time and (4) Validate the ability of our protocol and analysis tools to quantitatively detect changes over time in the knees of subjects with OA of the knee. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging and analysis techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue integrity in cartilage, meniscus, synovium, and bone marrow. This novel data acquisition will be paired with an innovative three-dimensional analysis approach that will allow quantitative assessment of multiple joint tissues at a single time point and over time. The significance of this work is that e will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes of OA over time with accurate registration of multiple joint tissues. This will lead to new insights into OA pathogenesis and progression, as we will be able to relate changes in adjacent joint tissues and across time in subjects with OA.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current dogma suggests that all hematolymphoid lineages are derived from a common ancestor, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). HSCs are believed to be the only cells with long-term self-renewal capacity in the bone marrow (BM), and are generally regarded as the cell of origin for continuous multi-lineage blood production during adult life. Evidence supporting this HSC-centric paradigm has been acquired through decades of work based largely on the use of functional assays involving transplantation. However, it is unclear to what extent functional characteristics of cells assayed under transplantation conditions are shared with cells driving non-transplant native hematopoiesis. Because of a historical lack of tractable systems, the mechanistic nature of non-transplant blood production has remained largely unexplored. To address this limitation, my laboratory has developed a novel experimental system in mice where cells can be uniquely and genetically labeled in situ. Using this system, clonal fate of multiple hematopoietic populations can be tracked over time and across lineages, for the first time, in a native context. Our preliminary findings with this model have revealed surprisingly unique features of unperturbed hematopoiesis. Among other things, our data demonstrate that long-term native hematopoiesis is mainly driven by waves of progenitor recruitment and that HSC contribution during this process is minimal. Thus, we hypothesize that native hematopoiesis is driven by fundamentally different mechanisms as transplantation. In this proposal, we aim to extend our earlier findings and to provide comprehensive insight into the biology of blood production in situ. Specifically, we will test whether HSCs can be recruited into productive hematopoiesis via injury, stress, or infection. We will also test whether progenitor recruitment can exhaust during the aging process. Additionally, we will revisit the existence of classical progenitor populations and lineage relationships using our clonal strategy. Completion of this project would elucidate the basic mechanisms underlying blood production and provide insight into stem cell dynamics during disease processes.',\n",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon the momentum of California's State University, Long Beach's historical commitment to training a diverse community of biomedical and behavioral research scientists. It utilizes best practices from the University's successful MSD, MBRS, COR, MARC, and RISE programs, the growing literature on the development of scientists from underrepresented (UR) and underserved communities, and a university wide self-assessment to design a program of activities. The goals of this CSULB RISE Program are to: 1) increase the number of underrepresented students (URS) completing degree studies in biomedical and behavioral science fields; 2) establish a research training curriculum that provides the skills needed by biomedical and behavioral researchers; 3) create an environment in which participants leave the program fully steeped in the culture and ethical practice of biomedical and behavioral research professionals; 4) increase the number of URS who successfully complete doctoral programs in biomedical and behavioral science fields. To accomplish these goals, the proposed RISE program will include eight major types of activities collectively designed to attract students from underserved communities and help support and strengthen their identity as scientists, and to provide a progressively rigorous educational environment that promotes critical, analytical, quantitative, creative thinking, and research skills that prepare participants to successfully compete in Ph.D. programs in biomedical and behavioral fields: (1) outreach to recruit underrepresented students into biomedical and behavioral sciences research and into the RISE program and other student development programs; (2) training and support to enable lower division students to enter into directed research, leading to independent research and entry into PhD study; (3) hands-on career exploration by students throughout their undergraduate program that focuses on biomedical and behavioral career opportunities and pathways; (4) a series of courses and workshops designed to train participants as ethical scientists, develop key academic and workforce skills, and prepare participants to successfully enter graduate study; (5) intensive laboratory research experiences under the mentorship of biomedical and behavioral faculty research faculty members; (6) biomedical-related shadow and research fellowship experiences on campus and at regional doctoral- granting institutions; (7) mentoring of matriculated RISE Fellows in their first two years after leaving CSULB as they transition to successful PhD studies, and (8) an on-going learning community which facilitates knowledge and professional growth and exchange between current and former RISE participants.\",\n",

       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction hypothesis is one of the leading postulates for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SCZ) and is supported by numerous pharmacologic, behavioral and genetic studies. Nevertheless, we have little insight into specific alterations in NMDAR signaling and its mechanistic basis in SCZ patients. This is a critical knowledge gap, which has impeded further development of this hypothesis and limited our efforts to identify specific therapeutic interventions. (Preliminary Data) As direct evidence for altered NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling, we found decreased NMDA/Glycine induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDAR subunit 2 (GluN2) and reduced downstream signaling in the postmortem dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of SCZ cases. These changes are not associated with decreased NMDARs but with reduced activity of a cascade of kinases- Src kinase, protein kinase C and Pyk2- which in concert decrease GluN2 tyrosine phosphorylation. We found multiple molecular alterations in the DLPFC of SCZ cases; increased PSD-95, increased erbB4 activity, decreased dysbindin -1 and RPTPa, each of which can induce Src hypoactivity. (Hypotheses) We hypothesize that hypoactivity of Src in the NMDAR complex (Src-NR) reduces GluN tyrosine phosphorylation and is caused by altered protein interactions in a network of Src-NR-associated proteins ( the Src-NR interactome), which can be leveraged to modify behavioral phenotypes of NMDAR hypoactivity. (Approach) We propose a human-rodent translation strategy, by which we analyze disease related alterations in postmortem brains and examine their underlying mechanisms in rodent studies. Aim 1 will further examine postmortem brains of an elderly and mid-life SCZ cohorts to identify molecular alterations in the Src-NR interactome in SCZ, Aim 2 will determine the role of protein interactions in Src-NR hypoactivity and test rescue strategies in ex vivo preparations of rodent and human postmortem tissues and Aim 3 will determine SCZ related behavior and EEG phenotypes of Src-/- mice and test if Src enhancement can rescue such phenotypes in vivo.',\n",
       " 'Blast exposure is a common experience of Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom/ Operation New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) Veterans. There is growing concern that repetitive blast exposure may be a risk factor for neurological disorders, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The pathogenic processes that link early-occurring, often transient brain injuries, to subsequent chronic behavioral and cognitive impairments are not well understood. The pathology underlying these impairments is poorly understood.  A number of important knowledge gaps currently impede progress toward elucidating the patho- physiology of repetitive blast-related mTBI that include, limited insight into the translational significance of the pathology produced in blast-induced animal TBI models with reference to neuroimaging findings in Veterans with blast-related mTBI. Moreover, the very limited neuropathological information from such Veterans significantly limits our understanding of blast-related mTBI.  Adding to the complexity of this issue numerous research groups have reported multiple forms of blast- induced pathology in a number of animal blast TBI models including: aberrant tau expression, reactive astrocytosis, microgliosis, axonal injury, myelin damage, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Much attention has been placed on tau because of its close association with sports-related CTE. Whether repetitive blast-related mTBI follows that same pathogenic pathway to CTE, which is defined chiefly by specific tau deposits, remains an open question.  However, recent findings call attention to prominent glial pathology in Veterans with blast-related mTBI, raising the possibility that this form of neurotrauma may represent a distinct class; or possibly a distinct pathogenic process leading to chronic mTBI (which also may involve tau pathology).  In repetitive blast exposed mice we have found microglial and astroglial pathology that, especially in subcortical regions of the brain, is quite similar to the white matter-associated glial pathology recently reported in Veterans with blast-related mTBI. We also have evidence that discrete microdomains of early-occurring BBB disintegrity are closely associated with aberrant microglial responses that include myelin phagocytosis, astrogliosis, and neuron loss. These data have prompted us test four closely related hypotheses: Specific Aim 1: will test the hypothesis that in blast exposed mice, specific brain regions are vulnerable to  early-occurring blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption; and that these disruptions may trigger later persistent  pathology associated with myelin disruption, as well as axonal and neuronal injury. Specific Aim 2: will test the hypothesis that in mice, white matter pathology involving glial-mediated myelin  phagocytosis and axonal injury will be closely associated with reduced fractional anisotropy. Specific Aim 3: will test the hypothesis that specific brain regions with myelin, axonal injury, and BBB disrupt-  tion in mice will correspond to DTl neuroimaging findings in similar brain regions in Veterans with blast-  related mTBI. Specific Aim 4: will test the hypothesis that neuropathology findings in brains from Veterans with blast-related  mTBI will be found in the same anatomical regions as those identified by neuroimaging in living Veterans and  will correspond with the pathology in blast-exposed mice.  Successful completion of these aims will: (i) facilitate progress toward understanding the pathogenic cascades leading to chronic behavioral and cognitive impairments in Veterans with blast-related mTBI; and (ii) refine the translational relevance of animal blast TBI models needed to improve their usefulness as tools to speed the search for strategies to treat and prevent chronic blast-related neurodegeneration.',\n",
       " 'Nearly 1 in 20 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in their lifetime, and over 1/3 of these will die from the disease. In fact, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in this country. Advances in prevention and treatment have made only a modest impact on incidence and survival. Novel treatment strategies for colorectal cancer are clearly needed. Chemokines have emerged as a crucial link between tumor-promoting inflammation and cancer. CCR6 is the only known receptor for the inflammatory chemokine CCL20, which in turn is the only known ligand for CCR6. Several lines of evidence suggest that interactions between the inflammatory chemokine CCL20 and its receptor CCR6 play a key role in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. Correlative evidence has suggested a possible role of CCR6 and CCL20 in promoting colorectal tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. To date, however, beyond our preliminary results, there is a paucity of in vivo data on the effect of disrupting CCL20-CCR6 interactions in colorectal cancer in the setting of an intact immune system. We have demonstrated that both CCL20 and CCR6 are upregulated in human colon cancers. We have found that deficiency of CCR6 is associated with a dramatic decrease in adenoma formation in a model of spontaneous intestinal carcinogenesis and a marked decrease in tumor growth in a syngeneic transplantable tumor model. We have observed that CCL20 signaling through CCR6 induces further secretion of CCL20, and this in turn promotes proliferation and migration in colorectal cancer cells. In addition to the epithelial cell effects of CCL20-CCR6 interactions, a stromal effect is evidenced by the fact that in the tumor challenge experiments, the transplanted colon cancer cells expressed CCR6 in both arms, yet growth was delayed in CCR6-deficient host mice. We have found that CCR6 deficiency is associated with decreased macrophage migration into adenomas and transplanted colon cancers. We have further demonstrated that CCL20-CCR6 interactions indeed induce monocyte/macrophage migration in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we have observed that growth of transplanted colon cancer tumors is delayed by depletion of tumor macrophages. Lastly, we have found that tumor macrophages secrete inflammatory mediators, which in turn induce proliferation of colon cancer cells. In aggregate our preliminary results imply that CCL20-CCR6 signaling promotes colorectal cancer through a direct effect on neoplastic cancer cells as well as through effects on tumor stromal cells such as macrophages. We have recently begun to test a novel, orally-available small molecule CCR6 inhibitor. Our preliminary data show that this molecule can inhibit the CCL20 auto feedback loop, colorectal cancer cell proliferation, and monocyte migration in vitro. Thus we hypothesize that targeting interactions between CCL20 and CCR6 is effective for the treatment of colorectal cancer. To test this hypothesis and to further elucidate the role of CCR6 and CCL20 in colorectal cancer, we aim to: 1) establish the impact of targeting CCL20-CCR6 interactions on the neoplastic epithelial cells in colorectal cancer; 2) establish the outcome of targeting CCL20-CCR6 interactions on tumor-promoting stroma in colorectal cancer; and 3) establish the efficacy of targeting CCL20-CCR6 interactions in translationally relevant models of human colorectal cancer. The proposed studies will shed light on the role of the chemokine receptor CCR6 and its ligand CCL20 in colorectal cancer. We believe that these studies will determine the clinical relevance and therapeutic importance of interactions between CCR6 and CCL20 in this disease and should pave the way to successful targeting of this pathway in human patients.',\n",
       " 'The toxic side effects of many commonly used therapeutic agents can result in drug dose reduction or discontinuation, limiting the use of these effective and inexpensive agents in the clinic. Protecting against dose limiting toxicities would improve patient quality of life and has the potential to improve therapeutic outcomes by increasing compliance with treatment regimens and allowing increased treatment times and doses. With previous VA funding, we have been investigating mechanisms to decrease or eliminate the toxic side effects of cancer chemotherapy for two decades and have moved from basic research to Phase III clinical trials. Our research has demonstrated that delayed administration of the thiol chemoprotective agents sodium thiosulfate (STS) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an effective strategy to reduce the cochlear, renal and bone marrow toxicities of the platinum-based chemotherapy agents cisplatin and carboplatin without decreasing their anti- tumor efficacy. This proposal will expand our chemoprotection strategy to aminoglycoside antibiotics that are commonly used in the VA patient population for the treatment of serious infections. Additionally, we will test the hypothesis that inflammation following activation of the innate immune response in the cochlea will enhance the ototoxic side effects of cisplatin chemotherapy and aminoglycoside antibiotics. To investigate the mechanisms underlying toxicity and chemoprotection, we will test novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using the iron oxide nanoparticle contrast agent ferumoxytol. Ferumoxytol is taken up by macrophages and activated microglial cells over the course of 24 hours, providing a non-invasive marker of inflamed tissues. We hypothesize that ferumoxytol enhancement on MRI will provide a quantifiable biomarker to measure inflammation in the cochlea and the impact of inflammation on ototoxic stimuli, as well as the impact of chemoprotection on these processes. In Aim 1 we will evaluate innate immune system enhancement of cisplatin ototoxicity using generalized systemic inflammation versus localized acute neuroinflammation. We will evaluate the magnitude of ototoxicity and inflammatory cell infiltration into the cochlea, and determine whether thiol chemoprotection blocks the enhanced cisplatin toxicity. We will investigate high-resolution MRI with ferumoxytol to assess inflammation and cisplatin ototoxicity and determine the impact of STS and NAC on these processes. In Aim 2 we will assess chemoprotection for endotoxemia-potentiated aminoglycoside ototoxicity. We will use ferumoxytol MRI to assess cochlear vessel permeability and inflammation. Our overall goals are to develop chemoprotection strategies against the side effects of therapeutics and imaging biomarkers to improve detection and management of inflammation, ultimately improving long-term outcomes for VA patients.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent professional antigen presenting cells of the immune system and serve as a bridge between innate and adaptive immune responses. When DCs are activated by a stimulus through toll- like receptors (TLRs), DCs undergo a process of maturation, defined by cytokine & chemokine secretion, co- stimulatory molecule expression, antigen processing and presentation, and the ability to activate T cells. DC maturation is coupled with an increase in energy demand, which is fulfilled by a TLR-driven burst in glycolytic metabolism. Up-regulation of glycolysis in activated DCs provides these cells with molecular building blocks and cellular energy required for DC effector function. Inhibition of glycolysis impairs both the survival and effector function of activated DCs. According to the prevailing model in the field of DC ?immunometabolism?, TLR-driven glycolysis in DCs is sustained primarily by increases in glucose uptake. While non-immune cells, specifically hepatocytes and muscle cells, can store glucose in the form of glycogen as an intracellular energy reserve, the role of glycogen metabolism in supporting DC immune responses has not been described. Our preliminary data show that DCs express enzymes essential for glycogen metabolism and that inhibition of glycogen metabolism significantly impairs key activation parameters of these cells. This indicates that glycogen metabolism in DCs may play an important role in supporting the effector function of DCs. This proposal aims to answer how glycogen metabolism regulates and supports the course of immune activation in DCs. We propose using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches in both human and mouse DC systems to test the hypothesis that glycogen metabolism is an essential component of DC energy homeostasis that is required for supporting effective immune functions of these cells. !',\n",
       " 'Abstract Over 200 million people worldwide are infected with HCV. The majority of these people will progress to chronic infection, resulting in severe liver disease such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, an effective HCV vaccine would be ideal to prevent HCV infection and liver disease worldwide. Papillomavirus-like particles are the major components of the licensed human papillomavirus vaccines from GSK and Merck. The virus-like particles (VLPs) formed by papillomavirus L1 protein are highly immunogenic even in the absence of adjuvants. The surface loops of the L1 protein can be replaced to express foreign sequences and immunization with the VLPs formed by the chimeric proteins can induce strong antibody responses against the inserted epitopes. Furthermore, the VLPs are able to package DNA plasmids expressing genes of interest to form pseudoviruses (VLPs with plasmid inside). The pseudoviruses are able to elicit strong antibody and T-cell responses via systemic immunization. We hypothesize that papillomavirus pseudoviruses can be used to present linear HCV envelope epitopes to the immune system on the surface loops of L1 to induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies while at the same time deliver plasmids encapsulated within the pseudovirus particles to induce strong HCV specific T-cells to the HCV NS3 protein. We plan to insert known HCV neutralizing antibody epitopes (polyprotein amino acids 412 ? 426 and 496 ? 515) into the bovine papillomavirus L1 protein three surface loops. We will make BPV-HCV chimeric VLPs (CVLPs) with the chimeric L1 and L2 proteins using a baculovirus expression system. We plan to immunize mice with the CVLPs and determine neutralizing antibody titers against HCV cell culture virus. The goal is to make a CVLP presenting the two HCV neutralizing epitopes. Furthermore, we will insert the HCV NS3/NS4A native sequence as well as a rearranged NS3 sequence into a plasmid for expression under a mammalian promoter. The rearranged sequence is to increase the instability of NS3 which will in turn increase degradation and result in increased T-cell responses. We will use the developed CVLP to package the plasmids to form BPV-HCV pseudoviruses. We will immunize mice with the pseudoviruses carrying the NS3/4A plasmids intramuscularly as well as Adenovirus expressing NS3/4A (a positive control) and test splenic T-cells by ELISPOT and flow cytometry to assess polyfunctionality and phenotypes induced by the pseudoviruses. Finally we will use the pseudovirus that induces strong neutralizing antibody and CTL responses to immunize a humanized HCV infection mouse model (Dorner-Ploss) which is susceptible to HCV infection, and challenge them with HCV to assess protective qualities of the induced immune responses.',\n",
       " 'Project Abstract This is an application for renewal of a grant to study picornavirus genome replication. Studies of poliovirus (PV) continue to establish paradigms for the molecular and cellular biology of all positive-strand RNA viruses capable of causing morbidity and/or mortality in humans. PV replicates its genome in association with membranes. In fact, the virus creates its own genome-replication organelle (RO) with a unique lipid composition, including an abundance of the phosphoinositide (PIP), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P). During the past five years, many laboratories have been in search of the mechanism by which PI4P biosynthesis is induced by various picornaviruses, including PV. In general, these studies tested the hypothesis that a single viral protein hijacks a single cellular PI4 kinase (PI4K), leading to kinase relocalization and synthesis of PI4P. Because of the long-established connection between the enteroviral 3A(B) protein and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GBF1, most of the early studies focused on 3A(B) and concluded that this viral protein is responsible for hijacking a PI4K, often by an indirect mechanism. However, this once-held consensus opinion has now returned to uncertainty. Many years ago, our laboratory obtained genetic evidence of a possible role of 3CD in the biogenesis of PV RO. During the previous funding period, we made a definitive connection between 3CD and RO biogenesis by showing that 3CD is both necessary and sufficient for induction of PI4P biosynthesis in cells. We demonstrated that the normal cellular GBF1-Arf1-PI4K axis is employed. We identified two derivatives of 3CD with amino acid substitutions in the 3C domain (3CmD) or 3D domain (3CDm) that are defective for induction of PI4P biosynthesis at discrete steps in this pathway. In both instances, the derivatives exhibit perturbations to PIP-binding activity of 3CD. In addition to PI4P, 3CD also induces PI(4,5)P2 (PIP2) biosynthesis in cells. PIP2 induction does not arise from the 3CD-dependent increase in PI4P but appears to be a distinct process based on the observation that both 3CmD and 3CDm proteins remain competent for PIP2 induction. PV 3CD is a PIP-binding protein and a regulator of multiple PIP biosynthetic pathways. Our proposed studies aim to address how and why. During the next funding period, we will pursue the following specific aims: (1) Define the structure-function relationships of the PIP-binding domains of 3C and 3D alone and in the context of 3CD; (2) Elucidate the mechanism of induction of PI4P biosynthesis by 3CD alone and in the context of infection; and (3) Elucidate the mechanism of induction of PIP2 biosynthesis by 3CD alone and in the context of infection.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Adult stem cells regenerate tissue by dividing asymmetrically, producing both new stem cells and differentiating daughters. Spermatogonial stem cells provide a lifetime supply of sperm in organisms ranging from flies to man. Like all germline stem cells, they uniquely transmit the genome to future generations. Signals from specialized local microenvironments (or niches) regulate stem cells in general, but in most tissues niches are difficult to identify and manipulate in vivo. An exception is the Drosophila testis, which is a leading model for stem cell biology. In this tissue, local Janus-kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) signaling promotes stem cell renewal within a well-defined niche, while cells exiting the niche differentiate. In our prior work, characterization of STAT targets led us to discover that an individual stem cell can acquire a mutation that gives it a competitive advantage: as a result, that cell and its progeny can displace all of the neighboring (wild-type) stem cells from the niche over time. This phenomenon, called stem cell competition, has intriguing but unproven connections to human reproduction. Older fathers have a higher risk of having children with genetic defects such as dwarfism that are caused by rare, dominant activating mutations in signaling pathway components. Although the mutations are bad for the offspring, they are thought to be are selected for in aging men because they give individual spermatogonial stem cells a competitive advantage. Since stem cell competition has not been observed directly in mammals and is not understood mechanistically, in Aim 1 we characterize this process in depth using the Drosophila testis, which offers genetic approaches that surpass those available in mammals, and should inform the understanding of stem cell competition quite generally. In addition to controlling stem cell competition, niche signals also ensure that stem cells in the adult Drosophila testis maintain their ?male? identity. Sex maintenance, which is a type of stem cell transdifferentiation, occurs in mammals but is not well understood mechanistically. Therefore, in Aim 2 we combine genome-wide analysis of gene expression with genetic tools unique to Drosophila to learn how sex maintenance is regulated in vivo. This will advance the field of regenerative medicine and continue to expand our understanding of spermatogonial stem cells - the cornerstone of male reproduction.',\n",
       " 'Coronaviruses have the largest genomes among known RNA viruses and are phylogenetically divided into four genera. Some betacoronaviruses, such as HKU1, circulate annually in humans and cause mild yet prevalent respiratory disease whereas others, such as SARS-CoV and the recently emerged MERS-CoV, have caused pandemics with high case-fatality rates. Due to their pandemic potential and airborne transmissibility, highly pathogenic coronaviruses are now classified as NIAID Category C priority pathogens. Coronavirus cell tropism and host range are in large part determined by the viral surface spike (S) glycoprotein, which is the largest known class I viral fusion protein. After binding to host receptors and activation by host proteases, the S proteins undergo large conformational rearrangements that result in fusion of the viral and host-cell membranes. A molecular understanding of the structure, function and antigenicity of intact, trimeric S proteins would identify sites of vulnerability that could be targeted by vaccines, therapeutic antibodies and small- molecule antivirals. However, structural studies have been primarily limited to small S protein fragments, which has precluded a unifying structural framework for the biology of coronavirus S proteins.  To address this knowledge gap, we have generated soluble, trimeric S proteins from HKU1 and MERS- CoV that are amenable to structural analysis by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. We will determine atomic-level structures of these S proteins in both the prefusion and postfusion conformations, which will identify commonalities and differences among divergent betacoronaviruses and define the conformational end-states of the fusion process (Aim 1). With these constructs and a range of biochemical and biophysical assays, we will determine the molecular basis for receptor-induced conformational changes and investigate the effects of host proteases and acidification on this process (Aim 2). The combination of these studies will provide key molecular insights into S protein-mediated membrane fusion and answer long-standing questions regarding S protein triggering. Similar to other class I fusion proteins, such as influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and HIV-1 envelope (Env), coronavirus S proteins are the primary target for neutralizing antibodies and are thus a critical component of developmental vaccines. Currently, the best-characterized antibodies against coronaviruses target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and prevent binding to host cells. The RBD, however, is the most variable part of the spike protein and antibodies that target this domain are unlikely to be cross-reactive, similar to most HA head-binding antibodies. Therefore, we will define the epitopes and mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization for novel, non-RBD-directed neutralizing antibodies isolated by our collaborator Dr. Barney Graham (Aim 3). By identifying conserved sites of vulnerability, these studies will provide the foundation for the development of immunotherapies and vaccines that broadly protect against highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses, including those that have yet to emerge.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of the proposed research is to learn what controls whether injuries heal with scarring/fibrosis versus full regeneration of los structures. The human health burden of fibrosis and scarring is enormous and affects every tissue from heart (lost heart function after a myocardial infarction) to lung (idiopathic lung fibrosis). Enhancing regeneration could prevent for example the almost universal recurrence of chronic wounds in the exact location where they previously appeared. We use the Wound Induced Hair Neogenesis (WIHN) model system where in the center of excisional wounds in mice a variable amount of regeneration occurs and de novo hair follicles form in a recapitulation of embryogenesis. The goal of this grant is to understand the factors which control the frequency of regeneration. We will directly test the mechanism and the ability for candidate molecules which enhance regeneration in mice to do so in human subjects. The results of this grant promise to help define new treatments and diagnostics to enhance regeneration and wound healing.',\n",
       " \"Background: Benzodiazepine (BZD) use is a significant and persistent concern among older Veterans given the association of BZDs with adverse outcomes including falls, fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, increased risk of dementia, and mortality. In FY2015, over 82,000 Veterans ?75 years of age were prescribed a BZD despite abundant evidence of harms from both acute and chronic use and recommendations from professional organizations to limit use. Beginning in FY2013, the VA's Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative (PDSI) began monitoring a variety of psychotropic quality measures, including BZD use among Veterans ?75 years of age (hereafter referred to as ?BZD?75?). Among the 52 facilities (out of 140) that selected BZD?75 as a priority, each developed its own local strategy to improve prescribing. In order for the VA to build upon local successes at addressing the seemingly intractable problem of BZD prescribing, the aim of this proposal is to understand the combinations of local facility strategies and context that generate these outcomes. In addition, it is critical to understand the patient experience of these strategies, as Veterans may experience some ?successful? strategies as extremely distressful. This work may directly influence the clinical care of Veterans and is of both great interest and immediate relevance to our operational partners, including PDSI, Pharmacy Benefits Management, and the Academic Detailing Service. Objectives: Aim 1: Identify high- and low-performing facilities on acute and chronic BZD prescribing among facilities that prioritized the BZD?75 measure. Aim 2: Assess facility-level strategies and associated barriers and facilitators to addressing the BZD?75 goal along with the acceptability of those strategies to older Veterans. Aim 3: Identify and pilot test context-sensitive strategies for facilities to successfully reduce both acute and chronic BZD use among older Veterans. Methods: We will use interrupted time-series analyses of national VA administrative data to examine BZD prescribing across BZD?75 priority facilities (n=52). We will specifically measure change in: (1) rate of acute use (new BZD initiation) and (2) intensity of chronic use (average daily dose [mg/day]). As an exploratory sub- aim, we will measure the rate of fall-related injury by facility to determine whether change in BZD prescribing is associated with change in associated adverse outcomes. In Aim 2a we will conduct semi-structured telephone interviews with up to 16 PDSI local facility champions and additional staff from top- and bottom-performing facilities (identified in Aim 1), followed by on-site, semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders at up to 6 sites. We will gather information on facility-level strategies, barriers, and facilitators that may help or hinder facility efforts. Finally, we will conduct telephone interviews with older Veterans prescribed chronic BZDs that attempted a taper to learn whether patients experienced these facility strategies as distressful. An expert panel of clinicians, researchers, and administrators will review the strategies, local context, associated BZD prescribing outcomes, and patient acceptability to develop a toolkit of context-sensitive best practices facilities can implement to address BZD use, which we will then pilot test.\",\n",
       " \"The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is designed to discover and characterize the range of molecular transducers (the `molecular map') that underlie the effects of physical activity (PA) in humans. We formed an interdisciplinary team with the requisite experiences to contribute significantly to the overall success of MoTrPAC. Our Exercise and Physical Activity Collaborative Team (ExPACT) ? an alliance of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Center for Exercise Medicine (UAB), Translational Research Institute for Metabolism and Diabetes in Orlando, Florida (TRI-MD), and Ball State University Human Performance Laboratory (BSU) ? has extensive experience performing highly-controlled aerobic (AT) and resistance (RT) exercise training clinical trials in healthy and diseased populations. We have a lengthy history of maximizing human biospecimens (muscle, adipose, blood) to reveal molecular underpinnings linked to physiological and clinical outcomes of acute and chronic exercise stimuli. Moreover, the overarching goal of ExPACT is to contribute substantively to successful MoTrPAC planning, execution, and innovation. Phase I (Planning Year) Aim 1. We will effectively collaborate with MoTrPAC leaders and NIH leadership to help guide and finalize the structure and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Aim 2. Leveraging institutional resources committed to ExPACT and our previous experience, we propose to collect pilot biospecimens to facilitate the MoTrPAC Chemical Analysis Sites' ability to optimize analyses. Phase II (Recruitment and Testing Years 2-5) Aim 1. We will enroll 420 sedentary but healthy men and women 18+ y into a rigorously controlled, 12-wk, randomized trial of AT (n=185), RT (n=185), or no-exercise control (CON, n=50). ExPACT geography will enrich MoTrPAC racial, ethnic, urban, suburban, and rural diversity. The design incorporates comprehensive phenotyping to assess fitness and clinical outcomes, and human tissue phenotyping to link the molecular transducers with key biological responses to exercise. Aim 2. Pre- and post- training, we will obtain strategically timed biospecimens before and after acute exercise. To better understand the biological extremes, we will conduct the same acute response studies in highly-trained athletes (AT (n=20) or RT (n=20)). Serial biospecimen collection in CON will allow estimation of biological, seasonal, circadian and methodological variability. Aim 3. To enhance the overall scientific impact of MoTrPAC, we will seek additional funding to conduct innovative ancillary studies, which will markedly augment subject and tissue phenotyping and interpretation of the molecular maps. Phase III (Close-out Year 6) Aim 1. We will complete all ExPACT data entry, quality control, and central deposit procedures in collaboration with the MoTrPAC Coordinating Center, and we will actively contribute to the completion of biospecimen analyses, manuscript writing, and dissemination of results. We would be honored to collaborate with MoTrPAC to contribute future knowledge on the molecular mechanisms through which physical activity can improve or preserve health.\",\n",
       " '1. Objective(s): This proposal aims to profile abnormal glycosylation in prostate tumors of veterans, to determine if engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting abnormally glycosylated proteins will demonstrate efficacy against bone-metastatic prostate cancer, and to evaluate mechanisms to improve T cell trafficking to tumor sites and enhance resistance to immunosuppression. 2. Research Design: De-identified veteran prostate cancers will be assembled into tumor tissue microarrays and profiled for abnormally glycosylated proteins through immunohistochemical and histopathological techniques, evaluated for spatial N-glycosylated epitopes through MALDI-TOF imaging, and characterized for O-glycosylated through cellular O- glycome reporter and amplification. An animal model of bone-metastatic prostate cancer will be developed through engraftment of a human osteoblast scaffold to support the bone-enrichment of implanted prostate cancer cell lines in NOD-SCID IL2R null (NSG) immunodeficient mice.  ? Xenograft animals will be treated with a single intravenous dose of human CAR T cells (n=10 per treatment group) to measure the efficacy and potential treatment limitations of adoptive immunotherapy for bone metastases. Lastly, genetic engineering approaches will be evaluated to improve T cell bone homing and increase resistance to immunosuppression, including ectopic chemokine receptor expression and gene-disruption of immune checkpoint molecules. 3. Findings: Preliminary results demonstrate strong expression of Tn-MUC1 in bone- metastatic prostate cancer. 4. Clinical Relationships: CAR T cells have been explored in the clinic for over 6 years, have demonstrated remarkable success for hematopoietic malignancies, but have lacked sufficient clinical success in solid tumors. Nearly 10,000 veterans are diagnosed with prostate cancer per year and bone-metastatic prostate cancer remains a significant treatment challenge. Successful findings from this study could develop new treatment options for veterans with prostate cancer as well as improve CAR T cell adoptive immunotherapy for solid tumors.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vision is critical for effective control of action. The dorsal stream projects to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and transforms visual input into corresponding responses to guide movements of different effectors. An influential model proposes that the dorsal stream is organized into dedicated visuomotor channels that are effector-specific and operate independently. Experiments for this proposal seek to rigorously test this model against alternatives in which channels guide movements of multiple effectors and can interact. We will first test whether coordinating visually-guided behaviors recruits effector-specific processes by recording neurons in the parietal reach system (Aim 1) and the parietal saccade system (Aim 2) during coordinated behavior. We will then test whether channels operate independently or interact by measuring the strength and functional significance of cross-areal coherence between the parietal reach and saccade systems (Aim 3). Despite the central role of coordination to visual behavior, how visual space for reaching and eye movements influence each other and whether cross-areal interactions within PPC underlie this influence is not known. Understanding the mechanisms of coordinated visual behavior will help us understand how visual behavior arises from interactions between different visual representations more generally. Damage to the PPC leads to optic ataxia, apraxia and neglect, is debilitating, and is suffered by many patients each year in the US with significant social costs Understanding how the brain constructs visual-spatial representations underlies the effective treatment of patients with posterior parietal damage.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are an estimated 7 million family caregivers who live at least one hour from the care recipient and are described as distance caregivers (DCGs)1,2,3. DCGs are a growing demographic; a majority are significantly involved in making care decisions as well as managing daily aspects of their family member's care (transportation, finances)3-7. Their anxiety, distress, depression, and poor health status are comparable to, and at times worse than, their local counterparts and they incur financial costs due to travel or lost work time that far exceed those of local caregivers3. A particularly vulnerable sub-population of DCGs are those of patients with advanced cancer-many of whom are near the end of life. To date, no one has tested an intervention aimed at the unique needs of this vulnerable and growing group of caregivers. The need to improve outcomes for DCGs is well recognized and there have been national calls to examine interventions for DCGs1,19-21. We will be the first to test interventions tailored to the unique needs of DCGs and delivered using a videoconference format. The goal of this randomized trial is to test the effectiveness of two arms of an intervention that use videoconference technology for DCGs of patients with advanced cancer. Key components of the full intervention have been tested46,52 and shown effective in reducing untoward caregiver psychological outcomes; they have not been fully tested with DCGs using videoconference technology. The first arm (Closer), will provide a minimum of four videoconference meetings (over a 4-month period) where DCGs participate in patient-oncologist office visits. Also, each DCG will receive a minimum of four personalized coaching sessions (via videoconference) from a registered nurse trained to deliver the key components of the intervention. The second arm (Video-C Only) will consist solely of videoconferences that include the DCG during patient-oncologist office visits-a minimum of four meetings over a 4 month period. The control group will have access to a website (Web-Only) with links to publically available information on cancer, caregiving, and distance caregiving. We project enrolling 613 DCG subjects and patients over a 3 year enrollment period. The study aims are to: 1) Compare the direct effects of Closer, Video-C Only, and Web- Only on DCG outcomes (anxiety, distress, depression, health status) over time, controlling for DCG demographic variables, 2) Examine the indirect effects of Closer, Video-C Only, and Web-Only on DCG outcomes (anxiety, distress, depression, health status) over time, controlling for DCG demographic variables, and 3) Examine the relationships between DCG distress, anxiety, depression and health status and patient distress, anxiety and depression over time. Impact: This will be the first study to test interventions tailored to the unique needs of DCGs using a videoconference format. If our aims are met, use of the Closer intervention has the potential to reach all caregivers who experience barriers to active participation in their family member's care-regardless of distance.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cannabis is pervasively consumed in the United States, especially during adolescence with more than 20% of 12th graders using this drug within the past year. As youngsters increasingly use this substance - and as the debates regarding its safety and legal status ensue - understanding the long-term neurobiological consequences of early cannabis exposure is paramount. Human studies convincingly demonstrate an association between early cannabis exposure and neuropsychiatric diseases ranging from substance abuse disorder (or drug addiction) to schizophrenia. In fact, these diseases are linked with earlier, more frequent consumption suggesting a causal relationship between developmental cannabis exposure and future mental health. Consistent with these epidemiological findings, animals exposed to THC, the main psychoactive component of cannabis, exhibit elevated heroin self-administration. These findings indicate that neurobiological disturbances causally contribute to addiction vulnerability later in life. Alongside these behavioral changes, adolescent exposure to THC induces long-term transcriptional changes in nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region of the ventral striatum that regulates reward and reinforcement. Small non-coding miRNAs regulate gene expression and are themselves persistently impacted by adolescent THC exposure, suggesting that these regulatory mechanisms may contribute to the stable, long-term changes in mRNA expression and behavior. The primary goal of this proposal is to identify miRNAs that impact addiction vulnerability via their interaction with proenkephalin (Penk). a neuropeptide precursor induced by adolescent THC that causally mediates heroin self-administration in rats. Since Penk is enriched in a distinct pathway within the NAc, an innovative yet feasible approach to identify and separate these neurons is proposed, allowing for a focused, hypothesis-driven molecular and behavioral study within the relevant neurons. Adolescent exposure to THC increases Penk mRNA and peptide levels in the NAc medial shell, contributing to addiction vulnerability, and I hypothesize that cell type-specific alternations in miRNA contribute to these persistent transcriptional alternations. I further hypothesize that reversing these miRNA derangements in a cell-type specific manner will reduce heroin self-administration even in at-risk animals exposed to THC during adolescence. Findings based on these proposed experiments will increase our neurobiological understanding of addiction as a developmental process and will bring to focus the health-related consequences of early cannabis exposure.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):  Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States, affecting approximately one in 12 people. Over the previous award period, research by our Projects and Cores identified mucosal mechanisms underlying airway inflammation and remodeling of asthma. Our overarching goal in this renewal of the Program is to uncover the fundamental mechanisms by which airway epithelial cells acquire pro-inflammatory functions and airway smooth muscle cells take on a hypercontractile and remodeling phenotype so that we can apply the discoveries to develop more effective and targeted therapies for asthma patients. We hypothesize that the mucosal epithelial-smooth muscle coupled unit initiates and perpetuates airway inflammation, hyper-reactivity and remodeling. To test this hypothesis, our team of scientists has strategized innovative and mechanistic Projects that are supported by powerful Cores that use cutting-edge technology to study primary airway cells, organotypic cultures, precision cut lung slices, murine genetic models and clinical study of asthma patients. Project 1 is a continuation and investigates how the activation of arginine metabolism, through arginase and nitric oxide (NO) synthases, regulates airway epithelial cell metabolism and epithelial cell cytokine and mucus production. Project 2 is a continuation and proposes to identify the mechanisms by which [[airway epithelium and smooth muscle interactions]] lead to a pathologic hyaluronan matrix in asthma. Developed as a collaborative new project, Project 3 investigates the mechanisms by which NO controls hemeprotein maturation important to airway epithelial function and smooth muscle reactivity, e.g. soluble guanylate cyclase, and [[explores pharmacologic soluble guanylate cyclase activators as a new pathway for bronchodilation.]] Project 4 is a new project made possible by Program-supported collaborations and investigates the resensitization of ÃŸ-adrenergic receptors in the asthmatic airway through kinase pathways that are regulated by nitrosylation. Asthma phenotyping and clinical samples are made available by Core B. Technically challenging and specialized assays for NO and primary cell cultures are supported by a new Core C. Models of asthma using genetically modified mice are provided by Core D. Our investigators have well-established productive collaborations and capitalize on Program synergies and interactions that assure the Program success. The focus of our integrated multidisciplinary team at every step of the Program is to apply discoveries for the better and safer care of asthmatic patients in the very near future.',\n",

This proposal builds on strengths in high-throughput genetics and genomics and development and application of innovative computational and statistical methods and genomics technology to maximize the benefits of genetic studies of cardiovascular disease. We will continue our discovery efforts to uncover genetic variants associated with a variety of cardiovascular diseases including atrial fibrillation, aortic aneurysm and dissection, and myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. Building on our previous work where we identified a number of new genes for coronary artery disease and lipids, we also propose to uncover the mechanisms underlying association at known loci using genetics and epigenomics. We propose to assess the phenotypic impact of the ~19 million variants and 20k indels and SVs identified from whole genome sequenced samples by imputing them into 70,000 new GWAS samples with many cardiovascular phenotypes. We will perform integrated analyses with epigenomics data to highlight clusters of loci with related function. We also propose to perform targeted sequencing of 300 genes in 30,000 CAD cases and controls to search for loss of function variants at CAD loci that implicate CAD genes. We will continue to search for mechanistic insight by performing a PheWAS for all CAD-associated variants identified, disentangling multiple independent signals and correlated traits and clinical endpoints using conditional testing. Completion of these studies will provide new insights into disease mechanisms that have the potential to catalyze breakthroughs in cardiovascular disease prevention, treatment, and diagnosis.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a fundamental gap in our knowledge to explain the intrinsic ability of centrioles to duplicate and function as microtubule-organizing centers. To fill this gap, we require a thorough molecular characterization of the very first steps in centriole assembly and pericentriolar material (PCM) recruitment; this deficit impedes our understanding of the etiology of centrosome-linked diseases. During mitosis, centriole function is activated and their duplication initiated by of the kinases, Polo and Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4), respectively. Normally, upon mitotic entry, cells contain two centrosomes, each containing a mother-daughter centriole pair that undergoes Polo-dependent `maturation', the process of recruiting additional PCM, allowing them to facilitate spindle assembly. As cells exit mitosis, each daughter cell inherits a centriole pair which has been modified by Plk4 to duplicate. Thus, Polo kinases control both the formation and duplication of functional centrosomes, and consequently, alterations in Polo kinase activity can dramatically influence spindle assembly and proper chromosome segregation. Our long-term goal is to better understand how cells couple cell cycle progression with centrosome function and duplication to ensure accurate distribution of the genome during division. The objective of this application is to understand how Polo and Plk4 are activated on mitotic centrioles to promote PCM recruitment and centriole duplication. Drawn from our preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that maturation and duplication are intrinsic behaviors of centrioles because Sas4, a centriole-surface protein, controls the activities of both master-regulators, Polo and Plk4. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the evolutionarily conserved fundamental mechanisms of centriole biology has the potential to translate into therapeutic strategies to address centriole-linked human disease. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Examine a mechanism of centrosome maturation whereby Sas4 activates Polo kinase to generate a mitotic platform for PCM recruitment; 2) Determine if Sas4 regulates Plk4 stability, and whether Sas4 phosphorylation by Plk4 controls the Plk4/Sas4 centriolar pattern to restrict daughter centriole assembly to a single site; and 3) Determine if phosphorylation of Asl and Sas4 by Plk4 induces formation of a daughter centriole initiation complex to recruit Ana2. The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it represents a new and substantive departure of the status quo by shifting focus to the role of the centriole surface protein, Sas4, as a key activator and substrate for both Polo and Plk4. The proposed research is significant because a thorough understanding of centriole biogenesis and function is intimately linked to our success in preventing/treating centriole-associated diseases (including ciliopathy, birth defects, neurodevelopmental disorders, and cancer).\",\n",
       " \"Abstract: Subcortical pathology is a common feature in aging, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia but has been challenging to study with micron resolution in vivo. Optical methods such as two-photon microscopy image the superficial cortex at the micron-scale, but the resolution of these conventional microscopic methods degrades rapidly beyond 600 microns imaging depth. Standard whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods do not yet provide cellular-level resolution and are expensive. Thus, there is a pressing need for methods to assess deep cortical and subcortical perfusion and cellular injury at the microscopic level, thus bridging the gap between existing superficial optical microscopy and macroscopic imaging. This proposal will develop, validate, and demonstrate advanced optical microscopy methods for longitudinal imaging of subcortical structures in the mouse brain using 2200 nm Optical Coherence Microscopy. 2200 nm imaging, in which tissue scattering is reduced by 2.5Ã— and 1.5Ã— compared to 1300 nm and 1700 nm, respectively, will enhance the delivery of ballistic (as opposed to multiply-scattered) photons to the focal spot, and enhance the proportion of photons backscattered from the focus that are detected without further scattering. Both of these benefits will substantially improve the signal localization, spatial resolution and signal-to background ratio when imaging deep in the brain. These methods will push penetration depths further into the living mouse brain, imaging subcortical structures (i.e. hippocampal proper and dentate gyrus) and pathology at higher resolutions than were previously possible.\",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT:  Metastatic melanoma is one of the fastest growing tumor types in the US, one of the top 5 cancers among Veterans, and is also one of the most challenging malignancies to treat. Currently immune therapies targeting the check-point inhibitors such as CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 can enhance the T cell response to tumor an these inhibitors have shown great success and as a result have moved to first line standard of care for most metastatic melanoma patients. Ipilimumab (targeting CTLA-4) combined with nivolumab (targeting PD-1) has yielded a 59% response rate in melanoma patients. Melanoma patients with an increased mutational load, and those with NF1 mutation, respond better to anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 therapy. However, side effects are often extensive, producing severe adverse events in >60% of patients including myocarditis for combined anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 therapy. Clearly, refinements of current treatments are needed to enhance survival of metastatic melanoma patients. Approximately 40% of melanoma tumors have mutation or loss of CDKN2A. One of the genes encoded by CDKN2A, INK4a is important for inhibiting the cell cycle kinases, CDK4/6. This results in loss of restrictions on cell cycle and enhanced proliferation of melanoma tumor cells. We have shown that inhibitors of the cell cycle kinases, CDK4/6, can both slow the growth of some melanoma tumors and also enhance T cell recruitment into the tumors. Moreover, approximately 80% of melanoma patients have activating mutations in the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK pathway (30% with mutation in NRAS and 51% with mutation of BRAF). Another 23% have alterations resulting in activation of the PI3K pathway. Recently rigosertib (RGS), a non-ATP competitive multi-kinase inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit the RAS/RAF/MEK and PI3K signaling pathways which are also crucial for melanoma tumor growth. We propose here to determine the effectiveness of combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with RGS in comparison to anti-PD1 therapy which is standard of care. We hypothesize that RGS, which targets multiple kinases, will be effective for treating RAS mutant melanoma in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors. We also propose that an even greater response will occur when check point inhibitors such as anti- PD1 or with activating antibody to CD137 are added to the RGS and CDK4/6i combined therapy regime. In this research grant we will examine the ability of CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with RGS to inhibit the growth of melanoma in immune competent mouse models of melanoma, including NRAS mutant, BRAF mutant, and B16 melanoma (WT for NRAS and BRAF). We will also examine the effects of CDK4/6 inhibition combined with RGS on the immune response to the tumor and characterize the effectiveness of combining RGS with anti-PD1 or other check point inhibitors, or with addition of anti-CD137 treatment in immune competent mouse models of melanoma. Finally, we will evaluate the effectiveness of combining CDK4/6 inhibitor and RGS with anti-PD1 or anti-CD137 for treatment of melanoma patient derived xenografts using humanized mouse models. This study should lead to new and improved therapeutic options for treating our Veterans with metastatic melanoma.',\n",
       " 'Central leptin resistance results in decreased downstream signaling to brain circuits that regulate food intake and energy expenditure (EE), thereby promoting hyperphagia and obesity. We and others have shown that the nonapeptide, oxytocin (OT), circumvents leptin resistance and elicits body weight (BW) loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents, nonhuman primates and obese humans, by reducing both food intake and increasing EE. The discovery of recruitable brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has renewed interest in targeting BAT to elicit weight loss by increasing EE. OT neurons that project directly from the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pPVN) to the hindbrain nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) are positioned to regulate energy homeostasis by reducing food intake and increasing BAT thermogenesis. In Specific Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that OT-induced stimulation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) outflow to interscapular (IBAT) contributes to its ability to elicit weight loss in DIO rodents. To test this, we will determine whether disrupting sympathetic activation of IBAT blocks the ability of fourth ventricular (4V) OT administration to increase EE and elicit weight loss in DIO rats. We will also determine if sympathetic outflow to both IBAT and white adipose tissue (WAT) mediates the effects of OT on EE by testing the extent to which pharmacological blockade of beta-3 adrenergic receptors (?-3-AR) impairs the ability of 4V OT administration to increase EE in DIO rats. In addition, we will determine if OT can be combined with low doses of the ?-3-AR agonist, CL316243, to increase EE and promote weight loss in DIO rats. Endpoints will include EE, IBAT temperature, norepinephrine turnover (NETO; marker of sympathetic activity), food intake, body composition (total and relative fat mass, lean mass), and BW. We anticipate these studies to establish a key role for SNS outflow to IBAT in the mechanism by which OT increases EE and elicits BW loss in DIO rats. In Specific Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that in DIO rhesus monkeys, intranasal OT reduces BW and improves glucose tolerance and other metabolic parameters, in part, by stimulating SNS outflow to BAT. To accomplish this, we will determine if intranasal OT increases the temperature of axillary BAT (ABAT, the predominant BAT depot found in rhesus monkeys) at a dose that elicits weight loss in DIO NHPs. We will also determine the extent to which intranasal OT elicits weight loss by reducing body adiposity while sparing lean mass and identify if these effects are associated with improvements in glucose tolerance. We will further identify if intranasal OT may also increase SNS outflow to WAT by measuring changes in subcutaneous WAT temperature and uncoupling protein-1 protein expression in subcutaneous WAT relative to ABAT (pre- and post-intervention). If we find that intranasal OT increases EE and BAT thermogenesis in the NHP model, these studies will provide evidence for a role for BAT activation in how OT elicits weight loss in a translational model of diet-induced obesity. Moreover, these studies will identify intranasal OT as a potential treatment option to evoke weight loss and improve glucose tolerance in humans and direct future studies to address the extent to which intranasal OT may reverse obesity in humans by stimulating BAT thermogenesis.',\n",
       " \"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction are extremely common in veterans. Up to 80% of veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, sleep disordered breathing or LV dysfunction (either systolic or diastolic) suffer from PH. Better RV function and female sex have been linked to improved survival in PH, and female patients exhibit better RV function than their male counterparts. This proposal builds on the scientific premise that even though RV function and female sex are major determinants of survival in PH, no RV-specific or sex steroid-directed therapies exist. Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and impaired angiogenesis play a major role in the development of RV failure, and data obtained in the previous funding period demonstrate that the female sex steroid 17?-estradiol (E2) increases capillary density in the RV and stimulates angiogenesis in cultured cardiac ECs. The goal of this proposal is to identify novel and therapeutically targetable mechanisms by which E2 exerts protective effects on RV EC function in PH. We provide evidence that E2 exerts its RV EC-protective effects via its receptor ER?, and suggest a new mechanism by which ER? activates bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) signaling to upregulate apelin, a potent angiogenesis mediator and EC survival factor, whose regulation in the RV is not yet known. Based on these findings, we now put forward the novel hypothesis that E2 improves RV function in PH by ER?- and BMPR2-dependent up-regulation of EC apelin. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To establish that E2 increases capillary density in the RV via BMPR2-dependent increases in EC apelin, and 2) To identify the contribution of ER? to increasing capillary density in the RV. We generated a novel ER? knockout rat that will enable us to study the role of ER? in the rat pulmonary artery banding model, thus avoiding the pitfalls of prior studies of sex hormone signaling performed in PH models without RV failure. These studies will be complemented by studies of BMPR2-deficient rats and apelin-deficient mice. These loss- of-function studies will be accompanied by studies in which we interrogate the therapeutic potential of ER? agonists, BMPR2 activators and apelin receptor agonists. We will complement these in vivo studies with experiments in RV ECs isolated from rodents with RV failure and from patients with compensated (adaptive) or decompensated (maladaptive) RV hypertrophy. Endpoints investigated will include RV function and structure (by pressure volume loops and echocardiography), exercise capacity (measured as VO2 max via treadmill running), RV capillary density (quantified using unbiased stereology and lectin staining), angiogenesis assays (matrigel tube formation and transwell migration), BMPR2 and apelin signaling pathways, as well as mediators of angiogenesis and EC survival and apoptosis. The proposed studies are significant, since they will 1) identify ER? as a critical modulator of RV function and 2) establish a novel and therapeutically targetable E2-ER?- BMPR2-apelin axis in RV ECs. The proposed studies are innovative, since they, for the first time, will provide a molecular basis for E2's RV- and EC-protective effects in PH. In addition, they provide technical innovation through use of a newly generated ER? knockout rat model, through use of a new highly selective ER? agonist that will allow for mechanistic dissection of ER??s role in ECs from failing RVs, and through use of unbiased stereology. Upon completion of the proposed studies, we will have identified ER? as a novel mediator of adaptive signaling in RV ECs. This may ultimately allow for the development of new RV-directed, non- hormonal treatments for both female and male veterans with PH and RV failure.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to link events with their temporal and situational contexts. This ability allows for memories to be truly autobiographical, and failures of episodic memory are signs of normal aging and neurodegenerative disease. The proposed research aims to illuminate the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying human episodic (contextually-mediated) memory through both computational modeling and the analysis of intracranial and scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings taken as neurosurgical patients and healthy adults search their memory for recently studied material. Using a model-based approach coupled with multivariate pattern analysis applied to electrophysiological data our ?rst aim is to elucidate the interacting roles f context and content information in episodic memory. We further seek to identify the anatomical substrates of content and context information in the process of memory formation, retrieval and reinstatement (Aim 2). Finally, we will carry out parallel invasive (intracranial EEG) and non-invasive (scalp EEG) studies to assess the viability of decoding neural signatures of episodic memory using non-invasive methods. This work will serve as an important bridge between the behavioral and neurobiological approaches to human memory, and will provide insights into the mechanisms of memory decline both in normal aging and in neurological disease.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Epithelial cells are a critical first line of defense against pathogens such as influenza and strategies to modulate epithelial cell signaling are therefore an appealing target for novel therapeutics. We have previously identified protein kinase D (PKD) as a key regulator of bronchial epithelial barrier integrity during viral infection and have recently identified PKD as a mediator of airway epithelial chemokine secretion. We hypothesize that stimulation with the double-stranded RNA polyI:C or Influenza A virus (IAV) infection leads to activation of PKD (specifically the PKD3 isoform) which increases epithelial chemokine release and promotes leukocyte recruitment. This project aims to determine the mechanism between PKD3 activity and epithelial human interleukin-8 (IL-8)/ murine chemokine CXCL1 secretion. To test this aim, we will assay PKD3 activity (substrate phosphorylation) following siRNA-mediated knock-down of potential receptors upstream PKD activation, and then use that information to inform identification of the adaptor molecule(s) associated with PKD (using co-immunoprecipitation). We will also assay IL-8/CXCL1 mRNA levels in human and mouse airway epithelial cell lines following knock-down of PKD isoforms to determine the isoform driving chemokine production. We will then use chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify PKD-activated transcription factors involved in IL-8/CXCL1 transcription and confirm activity with luciferase reporter assay. We further aim to investigate the therapeutic potential of PKD3 reduction/inhibition to attenuate lung injury following IAV infection. To test this aim, we will infect PKD3 deficient mice (PKD3-/-) with sub-lethal influenza A virus (IAV) and assay for leukocyte infiltration (via flow cytometry), chemokine secretion (via ELISA and multiplex array), and general pathology (histology). We will also generate bone marrow chimeric mice to assess the relative contributions of PKD3 in stromal cells vs. hematopoietic cells to lung injury and neutrophilia. We hypothesize that stimulation with the double-stranded RNA polyI:C or Influenza A virus (IAV) infection leads to activation of the PKD3 isoform which increases epithelial pro-inflammatory cytokine release and promotes leukocyte recruitment. We further hypothesize that PKD3 may play a previously unsuspected role in regulating airway epithelial anti-viral immune responses and that further study of the mechanism of PKD3-mediated cytokine release in the airway epithelium may lead to new therapeutics in combating viral respiratory infections.',\n",
       " \"SUMMARY Although APOL1 risk alleles are among the most powerful common genetic disease variants identified to date in terms of frequency and effect size, the presence of two risk alleles (a high-risk genotype) does not lead to kidney disease in all or even most individuals. We have been seeking factors that lead from APOL1 risk genotype to overt kidney disease. We have identified candidate genetic factors that modify the risk of disease. We have begun to dissect the upstream and downstream biochemical modifiers of APOL1-associated disease and believe that we have made significant progress towards these goals. Our genetic and biochemical studies have shown that pro-inflammatory stimuli such as interferons can regulate APOL1 expression leading to overt disease in individuals with a high-risk APOL1 genotype, and that disease is reversible when the stimuli are removed. We have begun investigating post-transcriptional modifications of APOL1 mRNA and the effect of microRNA on APOL1 levels. In this application, we outline studies to continue pursuing what we believe to be the most fruitful of these directions. We aim to do the following: Aim 1. Define the genetics and biology of loci modifying the APOL1-associated FSGS phenotype. We will replicate the admixture associations in individuals with FSGS that we have identified on Chr18q22-23 and Chr6p21-22 loci and determine if there is evidence of admixture association at other genomic regions as well. We will perform fine-mapping to identify the variants driving the admixture signal. We will perform functional tests of genes and their haplotype-defining variants. Aim 2: Define how inflammatory factors and pathways upregulate APOL1 expression in vitro and in vivo. We will elucidate how TLR4 activation (by LPS and lipids) drives APOL1 expression as we did previously for TLR3 activation (by double-stranded RNA). We will validate these pathways for APOL1 induction in vivo and observe how various inflammatory stimuli drive APOL1 expression in different kidney cell types. We will then ask how induction of wild-type and risk-variant APOL1 via these stimuli impacts kidneys in vivo and whether we can reverse APOL1 toxicity by blocking inflammation-driven APOL1 expression. Aim 3. Determine how the APOL1 3'UTR and microRNA regulate APOL1 function. We will identify the tissues and cells where APOL1 3'-UTR cleavage occurs. We will determine how APOL1 mRNA cleavage alters mRNA half-life and regulation by miRNA. We will explore how 3'-UTR cleavage alters APOL1 translation and trafficking. Lastly, we will pair a genome-wide miRNA screen with profiling of human glomerular miRNA expression to identify miRNA that regulate APOL1 in health and disease.  \",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer immunotherapy ? where the immune system is unleashed to destroy cancer cells ? is a revolutionary new approach for combating cancer. However, even though immunotherapy has achieved unprecedented efficacies in the clinic, many cancers are not yet amenable to immune therapy, and even for those that are, a majority of patients fail to respond. New agents with improved or complementary mechanisms of action are therefore needed. One intriguing, yet poorly understood potential cancer immunotherapy agent is the small molecule Val-boroPro. Val-boroPro induces immune-mediated tumor regressions in multiple mouse models of cancer by inducing pyroptosis, a lytic form of programmed cell death, in monocytes and macrophages. Notably, Val-boroPro was the first small molecule discovered that induces pyroptosis. It is now established that inhibition of the cytosolic serine peptidases DPP8 and DPP9 (DPP8/9) by VbP activates the pro-protein form of caspase-1 to mediate cell death, but how DPP8/9 inhibition leads to the activation of caspase-1 remains entirely unknown. The long-term goal of this project is to successfully harness this pathway for cancer immunotherapy. The objective of this proposal is to determine how the inhibition of DPP8/9 induces pyroptosis in monocytes and macrophages. The central hypothesis is that DPP8/9 cleave and inactivate one or more peptides, which, if not cleaved, activates the innate immune sensor protein Nlrp1. Activated Nlrp1 then activates pro-caspase-1, triggering pyroptosis. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratory and described in the application. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine strain, species, and cell type sensitivity to DPP8/9 inhibitors, as Nlrp1 is highly polymorphic and varies considerably across strains and species; 2) determine the molecular mechanism of Nlrp1 activation by DPP8/9 inhibitors; and 3) determine the function of a specific co- chaperone required for DPP8/9 inhibitor-induced pyroptosis, which we hypothesize is responsible for the stability, folding, or trafficking of a key pyroptosis factor (e.g., Nlrp1 or the DPP8/9 substrate). Successful completion of this proposal will uncover new principles and mechanisms regulating the innate immune system, providing insights into pathogen recognition, autoimmune disorders, and inflammation. Moreover, this work has extraordinary potential to identify new targets and strategies that could form the bases of novel cancer immunotherapies.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract Influenza virus infections result in substantial illness, mortality and societal impact worldwide. Influenza A virus (IAV) infections originate in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and can become systemic, potentially resulting in multi-organ failure and death. Neutrophils play a critical role in the vertebrate immune response to bacterial and fungal infections, but until recently it had been assumed that neutrophils are not essential for immune defense against viral infections. Recent evidence, however, suggests that neutrophils are involved in the immune response to IAV and may give rise to both positive and negative outcomes resulting from inflammation. This research will determine whether neutrophils, in the process of controlling IAV infections, trigger excessive inflammation through mechanisms involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and signaling via the cytokine, type I interferon. In the proposed project, the zebrafish serves as a novel animal model in which the innate immune response to influenza viral infection can be studied in the context of the whole animal. This work will involve a combination of molecular techniques and imaging microscopy to identify molecular mechanisms that are responsible for neutrophil recruitment to localized sites of infection in an effort to identify potential targets for intervention. Individual components of the respiratory burst, such as NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase, regulate ROS levels in order to contain IAV infections. By dissecting the pathways that control respiratory burst function, we expect to characterize how ROS control neutrophil behavior during an IAV infection to coordinate the antiviral response. We will determine how hyperinflammation occurs as part of an IAV infection so that therapeutic measures that preserve the antiviral response, yet contain the associated inflammation, can be developed. Through these studies we hope to gain valuable insight into the neutrophil response to IAV infection and the specific factors controlling the balance between optimum antiviral activity and excessive inflammation. Our new understanding will lead to positive human health benefits by serving as the basis for development of treatment strategies for maintaining effective antiviral activity against IAV infections while controlling the potentially damaging effects of the neutrophil inflammatory response.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Malaria remains a major global infectious disease, largely affecting people living in resource poor environments. Infection of humans with Plasmodium falciparum parasites results in significant morbidity and mortality. Drug- resistance is constantly undermining the usefulness of antimalarial regimens. It is imperative to identify new antimalarial drug targets to ensure the success of control and eradication efforts. Further, the call for malaria eradication requires an understanding of the determinants of parasite transmission. Plasmodium falciparum parasites utilize epigenetic machinery for the regulation of key processes within the parasitic life-cycle, including antigenic variation for persistence and pathogenesis during asexual proliferation, as well as for switching to sexual development for transmission through the parasitic life-cycle. We have obtained genetic evidence that the Class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) are essential for P. falciparum growth during the asexual cycle. We hypothesize that these P. falciparum HDACs regulate discrete and critical functions in the asexual and sexual biology of the parasite. Inhibition of these mechanisms will result in the specific killing of P. falciparum asexual and/or sexual forms. In this proposal, we will identify the essential functions of these enzymes that are responsible for asexual proliferation, conversion to the sexual stage, and sexual development for transmission. We will use a reverse genetics approach for the phenotypic analysis of mutant parasites in the asexual and sexual stages. We will probe the mechanistic basic of HDAC functions using a combination of bulk and single cell transcriptomics and epigenomics. Finally, we will uncover the precise mechanisms of action of the HDACs by dissecting the functions of their specific enzymatic domains, using biochemical and chemical genetic approaches. Together, these studies will serve to elucidate the functions of these critical epigenetic regulators in parasite biology relevant to asexual proliferation for virulence and sexual development for transmission, validating and characterizing these molecules as new targets for therapeutic development within the parasite.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Agent-based modeling has provided epidemiologists with an advanced tool to estimate critical epidemiologic outcomes among large, diverse populations. The proposed research will build on a well-established model platform, the HIV-Calibrated Dynamic Model (HIV-CDM), to construct a model of the HIV epidemic in Miami, which experiences among the highest rates of new HIV infection in the country. In response to the growing HIV epidemic in Miami, local policymakers, clinicians, and researchers have formed a ?Getting to Zero? Task Force that seeks to eliminate all new HIV infections in the Miami metropolitan area. The campaign is founded on the principle of combination prevention, which enlists the concurrent use of many evidence-based prevention strategies, such as treatment as prevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and frequent/targeted HIV testing. Presently it is unknown what effect this campaign will have on incident HIV infections in Miami. This proposal seeks to use agent-based modeling to estimate the long-term impact of the combination prevention program outlined in the Getting to Zero campaign adopted in 2017. Along with estimating specific epidemic outcomes (e.g., HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, time to epidemic elimination), this approach may also assess the relative contribution of each component to the success of the program. Such estimates will be crucial in maximizing the goals of the campaign, as well as assist with the implementation of similar HIV elimination programs. This proposal will: (1) expand the HIV-CDM model, to simulate the demographics and HIV risk behavior of the diverse metropolitan Miami population; (2) estimate the success and limitations of the Getting to Zero campaign using the HIV-CDM model; and (3) perform primary and secondary analyses within subgroups of the Miami population to better understand current research gaps, and those identified in the first two aims. Each component of the research plan will be supported and aligned with specific training components designed to provide the candidate with the necessary professional development and mentorship to execute the research aims, and begin an independent research career. The results obtained from this work may directly impact the assessment of the Miami Getting to Zero campaign and inform all future HIV elimination campaigns in the U.S. and globally. Additionally, the training program will provide exceptional methodological and practical experience leading to an independent and influential scientific career. Supporting this work will be a mentorship team of academic and community leaders in HIV elimination, epidemiology and modeling methodology. This mentorship will build on the methodological and substantive experience I have demonstrated while leading numerous studies on epidemic modeling and HIV epidemiology.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary The project aims to develop an HIV nonhuman primate model in which the breadth of protection by HIV Env- based active or passive immunizations can be determined in a quantitative manner in a limited number of animals. This should greatly improve the applicability of NHP studies for optimization and selection of candidate HIV vaccines or monoclonal antibodies for clinical efficacy studies and thus help to accelerate HIV vaccine development. The number of animals needed to determine the breadth of protection will be minimized by i) reducing animal to animal variation through referencing to an internal challenge virus control, ii) limiting the efficacy measurement to a single round of replication, and iii) challenging each animal simultaneously with a panel of different challenge viruses. The SIV based challenge viruses use HIV-1 Env for entry into target cells during the first replication cycle, but then switch to SIV Env for all subsequent rounds of infection. A challenge virus that uses SIV Env during the first and all subsequent rounds is included as an internal control that is not affected by HIV Env antibodies. Genetic tagging and next generation sequencing allows to determine the ratios of the co-injected challenge viruses and the influence of HIV Env antibodies on these ratios. As a proof of concept, fifteen different genetic tags will be introduced into the challenge virus and explored for their affect on virus replication. Based on these tags, a panel of challenge viruses will be generated and characterized that use 12 HIV Envs derived from transmitted founder viruses of different clades and geographic areas together with the internal control virus. Determination of the ratio of the HIV Env challenge virus to the internal control virus will be determined in rhesus PBMC cultures. To demonstrate in vivo infectivity of the 12 different HIV Env challenge viruses, they will be co-inoculated with the internal control virus intrarectally into six rhesus macaques. Ten days after inoculation the ratio of each HIV Env challenge virus to the internal control virus will be determined in the blood and different lymphatic tissues. The variation in the ratios between different animals should allow to determine group sizes needed in subsequent challenge experiments after active or passive immunization.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary-Abstract  Organisms living on Earth have to cope with daily changes in their environment. The circadian clock is an endogenous oscillator, with a period of approximately 24 hours, which enables organisms to coordinate metabolism, physiology, and development in anticipation of diurnal and seasonal environmental changes therefore enhancing their fitness. The intricate network underlying the circadian oscillator at the molecular level has long been thought to rely on interlocked transcriptional-translational feedback loops. However, additional layers of regulation at the cellular and organismal level are required to explain the complex behavior of the system. To unravel this wiring and elucidate the role of key clock components, in this proposal we plan to combine a set of biochemical, genetic, functional genomic, and bioinformatic approaches.  TOC1 is an essential player in the core oscillator and recent work in our laboratory suggests that it can bind to RNA. By solving the atomic structure of TOC1 we seek to dissect its molecular properties. This will be instrumental to comprehend its regulatory mechanism and its function maintaining plant rhythmicity and regulating the expression of output genes. GI is also an oscillator component required for the proper ticking of the circadian clock and acts as a key regulatory hub directly connecting the clock to a plethora of physiological processes. To investigate the pivotal role of GI in the regulation of output pathways we propose to uncover and characterize its interactome network through molecular, genetic and proteomic analyses. These results will shed light on its regulatory function in key physiological processes providing important advances in our understanding of how the circadian clock impacts plant development. Finally, it has been recently revealed that the plant clock might have a central oscillator, similar to the mammalian system, able to coordinate peripheral clocks. To examine the organization of the plant circadian system, we will perform a genome-wide tissue- specific expression analysis with exceptional spatio-temporal resolution, complementing it with a phenotypical characterization. Altogether, the approach outlined here will expand our understanding of tissue and organ specific clocks and their architecture to regulate physiological and developmental processes. The knowledge gained from this proposal will contribute to develop a comprehensive view of the circadian clock as a network expanding from the molecule to the organismal level. This concept can be combined with insights from other organisms to improve our interpretation of circadian biology, ultimately impacting research in human health and circadian associated disorders.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background/Rationale:  People with serious mental illness (SMI) die, on average, many years prematurely, with rates of premature mortality 2 to 3 times greater than the general population. Over 60% of premature deaths in this population are due to natural causes, especially poorly treated cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious diseases. Although the VA is a centrally organized, comprehensive healthcare system, veterans with SMI still have difficulty navigating the system, and are at substantially elevated risk for premature death. Too often, they do not attend scheduled appointments or fail to engage in primary care treatment, and consequently do not get valuable preventive and primary care services.  Primary care in VA has undergone significant transformation under the Patent Aligned Care Team (PACT) model, which is based on the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) concept. PACT has the goal of improving the quality, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of primary care. But it remains unclear how PACT will impact the large populations of veterans who get the majority of their care in specialty settings, such as people with SMI. Research can inform efforts to apply the PACT model in specialty settings. For example, while people with SMI do poorly with usual primary care arrangements, there is now substantial evidence that integrated care and medical care management approaches can improve medical treatment and outcomes, and reduce treatment costs, in people with SMI. Objective:  Using available evidence, we propose to implement and evaluate a specialized PACT model that meets the needs of individuals with SMI (SMI-PACT). Methods:  This project will partner with leadership at one medical center to implement SMI-PACT, with the goal of improving healthcare and outcomes among people with SMI, while reducing unnecessary use of emergency and hospital services. Evidence-based quality improvement strategies will be used to reorganize processes of care. In a site-level controlled trial, this project will evaluate the effect, relative to usual care, of SMI-PACT implementation on (a) provision of appropriate preventive and medical treatments; (b) patient health-related quality of life and satisfaction with care; and (c) medical and mental health treatment utilization and costs. The project includes a mixed methods formative evaluation of usual care and SMI-PACT implementation to strengthen the intervention, and assess barriers and facilitators to its implementation. Mixed methods will also be used to investigate the relationships between organizational context, intervention factors, and patient and provider outcomes; and identify patient factors related to successful patient outcomes. Significance:  This project's approach to SMI-PACT is consistent with the VA PACT model, and with efforts in VA to improve care for veterans with psychiatric disorders. This will be one of the first projects to systematically implement and evaluate the PCMH and PACT concepts beyond primary care. Should SMI-PACT be demonstrated to be feasible and effective, the model could be used more broadly to improve the quality and efficiency of care for veterans with serious mental illness. Findings regarding PACT in specialty mental health may also inform efforts to improve care in other specialty healthcare settings.\",\n",
       " \"The proposed research seeks to determine whether text messages/messaging (TM) or a mobile application (app), compared with an educational website-control provided to all Veterans, can improve adherence to antiplatelet therapy among patients following acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention (ACS/PCI). Adherence to antiplatelet medications is critical to prevent life- threatening complications (i.e., stent thrombosis); yet rates of non-adherence range from 21-57% by 12 months. Mobile technology through TM or mobile apps is a practical and inexpensive strategy to promote behavior change and enhance medication adherence. The three specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine preferences for content and frequency of TM to promote medication adherence through focus groups; 2) determine the most patient-centered app to promote adherence through a content analysis of all commercially available apps for medication adherence and focus groups centered on usability; and 3) compare adherence to antiplatelet medications in 225 Veterans post ACS/PCI through a randomized clinical trial. Participants will be randomized to either TM, mobile app, or website-control group. The focus groups will be stratified by low/high mobile phone use and sex. In addition, the proposed work will provide Dr. Park with the mentorship and experience necessary to establish herself as an early career investigator in the fields of cardiovascular disease prevention and mobile health research. Dr. Park's primary career goal is to become an independent nurse investigator who applies novel technology for patient-centered behavioral interventions to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for cardiac patients and Veterans. Dr. Park has assembled an outstanding interdisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in the required areas of training. Eileen Collins, PhD, RN will serve as Primary Nurse Mentor; Mary Whooley, MD will serve as VA On-Site Mentor; and Janet Shim, PhD will serve as Qualitative Research Mentor. In addition, John Boscardin, PhD will conduct all quantitative statistical analyses related to the study. Consultants include Yoshimi Fukuoka, RN, PhD (expert in mobile health strategies) and Dr. Michael Ho (expert in medication adherence and cardiovascular disease). Susan Woods, MD, MPH (Director of Patient Experience, Connected Health, Office of Information and Analytics, VHA) will serve as a collaborator, particularly in relationship to our use of ?Annie,? the new VA automated TM program with a goal to help patients take a more active role in their health. The Nursing Research Initiative will provide Dr. Park with an exceptional opportunity to receive the mentorship and experience necessary to prepare a strong scientific foundation for a compelling Investigator Initiated Research proposal to evaluate clinical outcomes (i.e., cardiac morbidity and mortality) through a multi-site full scale RCT. Determining the efficacy of mobile technology through a Veteran-designed protocol to promote medication adherence will have a significant impact on Veteran health and public health, particularly for individuals with chronic diseases that require strict medication adherence.  \",\n",
       " \"ABSTRACT  Despite stabilizing rates of prescription opioid pain reliever (OPR) overdoses, opioid-related mortality continues to rise because of increasing rates of heroin use and poisoning. Between 2013 and 2014, national estimates of nonmedical use of OPRs in the previous year declined from 11.08 to 10.34 million individuals. In contrast, heroin use increased from 0.68 to 0.91 million individuals. Mortality from heroin increased 26% in the last year and more than 300% over the last five years. The shift in trend is more than ecologic, as 40% to 70% of individuals who use heroin report nonmedical use of an OPR prior to initiating heroin. This is a substantial departure from historical trajectories of heroin use. For the great majority of individuals who began heroin use in the 1960s, heroin was their first opioid. While the risk of transition to heroin from nonmedical use of OPRs is low, contributing and pre-disposing factors are poorly understood. The burden of OPR and heroin-related adverse events is particularly high for individuals in Medicaid programs because they are more likely to have substance use disorders and are disproportionately represented among overdose deaths. The state of Oregon recently developed a state Performance Improvement Project (PIP) to reduce the proportion of high-dose opioid prescriptions in its Medicaid program, which is now delivered through 16 regionally and health system defined Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs). Because each CCO has flexibility to address the state's PIP, implementation across CCOs constitutes a natural experiment to study policy factors associated with change in OPR prescribing and heroin-related outcomes. In response to RFA-CE-16-003 (Research on Prescription Opioid Use, Opioid Prescribing, and Associated Heroin Risk; Priority #2), the objective of this study is to evaluate the relationships between OPR prescribing, CCO opioid dose reduction initiatives on patterns of OPR utilization, heroin use, and opioid-related overdoses. The objective is achieved through three Specific Aims using a mixed methods approach. First, using a multisource linked database that includes prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), Medicaid claims, vital statistics, and substance use treatment data from Oregon, relationships between OPR prescribing patterns and heroin-related outcomes will be tested. Second, using qualitative research methods, policies and procedures directed at improving the statewide high dose PIP by each CCO will be characterized. Finally, the effect of implementation of CCO PIP initiatives on high-risk OPR use and heroin-related outcomes will be evaluated. Findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of individual risk factors for transition to and overdose with heroin. Also, knowledge gained will assist local and national decision makers about policy levers to reduce the burden of OPR and heroin- related morbidity and mortality.\",\n",
       " \"Sepsis affects over 750,000 people per year in the United States and kills over a third of these patients. As such, it has proved to be one of the greatest challenges to modern medicine. The cellular and molecular events underlying the evolution of tissue injury and organ dysfunction during sepsis are under active investigation and promise to guide the development of therapeutics. As of now the treatment of sepsis is limited to treatment of the underlying infection and supportive care, without much of a individualized approach. An area of intense recent focus is bioenergetics, the mitochondria, and metabolomics. Mitochondrial responses are now known to orchestrate downstream cell signaling responses and outcomes, and thus greatly influence organ function and outcomes. Others and we demonstrate that in the setting of sepsis, signals to the mitochondria to regulate mitochondrial respiration and signaling from the mitochondria to regulate inflammatory responses are not only important in the early response to sepsis, but also critical to the recovery of the cell.  Our preliminary data show that sepsis patients have a profile of injured mitochondria. Additionally, that aging is associated with decreased mitochondrial reserve and less dynamic responses. Mitochondrial health and the ability to adapt to stimuli are crucial to the survival of organisms during stress. We show that during this response mitochondrial respiration is altered and that the mitochondrion orchestrates this response by initiating adaptive signaling responses. As a result mitochondria may become dysfunctional, and processes to mitigate this, including removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagic cell signaling (controlled removal of the organs) leads to decreased cell injury. Additionally reconstitution of a healthy mitochondrial population via mitochondrial biogenesis is necessary to ensure survival.  Based upon this we hypothesize the following: The baseline `health' of the mitochondrial network and the ability to adapt through robust mitochondrial dynamic responses are critical to limit inflammation, tissue injury, and organ dysfunction in sepsis.  We will test this hypothesis by addressing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To determine how bioenergetics/mitochondrial health influences organ injury and outcomes in sepsis. Specific Aim 2. To examine how mitophagy/biogenesis inducing therapies can be harnessed for therapeutic benefit in sepsis.  Our laboratory has been investigating organ injury in sepsis and the role of mitochondrial signaling. These novel studies will add insight into organ dysfunction in sepsis, have the promise of allowing determination of at risk patients and a personalized approach to sepsis treatment, and will help guide the development of therapeutics.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT A considerable body of evidence shows that exercise training induces multiple beneficial changes in cardiometabolic risk factors and that physically active individuals have lower mortality and morbidity rates than their sedentary counterparts. However, there are marked inter-individual differences in the responsiveness to regular physical activity with some individuals showing great benefits while others do not. While the response heterogeneity is clearly genetically determined, little is known about the molecular pathways and mechanisms that contribute to the adaptation to acute exercise and exercise training. The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to ?understand the molecular changes that occur in response to physical activity?. We therefore propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial in which we will collect biological samples (blood, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue) before and after a 12-week aerobic or resistance training program in healthy, sedentary individuals. In addition, we will collect samples before, during and after a single bout of exercise at baseline and after training. We will also collect biosamples in highly trained athletes involved in endurance or strength sports. The overarching goal of the program is to contribute to the development of a molecular map of transducers that underlie the effects of physical activity. To achieve this goal, investigators at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center propose to: 1) Enroll and randomize 518 healthy, but sedentary volunteers (50% Caucasians, 47.5% African Americans, 2.5% others; aged 21-75 y; BMI 20-40 kg/m2) in a 3/3/1 scheme to a 12-week intervention trial comprised of two exercise groups, aerobic (AER) and resistance (RES) training, and a control group (CON). The goal is to have 178 completers in each training group and 60 in the CON group (20% attrition). 2) Recruit and enroll 50 athletes (ATH) competing in endurance (n=25) and strength (n=25) sports to serve as an active control group. The ATH group will undergo baseline testing and an acute bout of exercise consistent with their normal training regimen with similar pre- and post-acute exercise samples collection. The AER program will start at 3 days per week of treadmill walking/running progressing to 4 days per week by week 2 with an initial moderate intensity (heart rate associated with 50% VO2peak), then increasing to a more vigorous intensity (HR 75% VO2peak) by week 6. The RES program will be performed 3 days per week and consist of 9 exercises on Universal Gym Equipment, including four upper body lifts, three lower body lifts, abdominal crunch, and back extensions. The RES program will progress from 2 sets of 10-20 repetitions to 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions after week 2. All AER and RES exercise sessions will be conducted under strict supervision by trained staff. Because of the expertise in training studies and translational research as well as the availability of state-of-the-art facilities, Pennington investigators are well positioned to recruit/retain a diverse population, conduct the proposed trial and collect/store the necessary biosamples.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY - PROJECT 4 Emerging evidence has implicated transcriptional coactivators and enhancer elements as having a central role in the pathogenesis of human cancer. The research outlined in Project 4 will develop transcriptional coactivators as proteins that support the aberrant capabilities of cancer cells, thus revealing a novel class of epigenetic drug targets in oncology. This research will explore the role of SWI/SNF and TFIID coactivator complexes in the pathogenesis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and will identify novel roles for coactivators in supporting the progression of late-stage Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA). The first Aim of this proposal will analyze the anti-leukemia effects of chemical inhibitors of the bromodomain of BRD9, which are novel compounds we generated in collaboration with Boehringer-Ingelheim. The major objective of this research will be to develop drug combinations that augment the therapeutic effects of BRD9 inhibition in AML. This will include use of CRISPR-scanning and domain-focused CRISPR screening, which are recently developed genetic tools to allow deep mechanistic investigation of endogenous protein complexes and to reveal opportunities for drug repurposing. This research has a direct potential to motivate clinical studies of novel drug combinations in AML patient populations. The second Aim will develop the TAF12/TFIID complex as a novel dependency in AML and reveal its underlying mechanism in supporting oncogene-mediated leukemic transformation. This will also include identifying suitable routes for direct chemical inhibition of this complex, an objective that has yet to be achieved in the cancer epigenetics field, largely owing to our incomplete understanding about how TFIID supports cancer pathogenesis. The third Aim of Project 4 will be to understand how modulation of nucleosome structure by writers, readers, and erasers of post-translational histone marks might endow PDA cells with the capacity to undergo metastasis. This will include domain- focused CRISPR screening to interrogate chromatin regulators that allow distal metastasis in mouse models of PDA. Since early metastasis is a major contributor to the high mortality of PDA patients, this research may significantly impact our basic understanding of the lethal form of this disease, and carries the potential for revealing epigenetic drug targets for this malignancy. Importantly, the research outlined in Project 4 will provide a deep mechanistic investigation of transcriptional mechanisms that support AML and PDA, which will rely on extensive use of epigenomic tools (e.g. ChIP-seq-based measurement of enhancer activity), and biochemical approaches. Project 4 will also feature extensive collaborations with the other Projects and Cores to evaluate molecular mechanisms and in vivo biology of malignant cells. This basic research will reveal novel vulnerabilities in lethal malignancies, which could provide new routes for therapy.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY-CORE B Core B supports every project within the Program by providing access to state-of-the-art CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi tools. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were developed with the support of this program, and ongoing innovations by Core B and Program investigators have helped to make these extremely powerful biological tools. During the past funding period, the Core devised a novel algorithm for predicting shRNA potency, which led to the generation of a 5th version of RNAi libraries corresponding to annotated protein coding genes in humans and mice. Technology has also been developed for using CRISPR-Cas9 screening to expose functionally important protein domains. During the upcoming period of requested support, the Core proposes to aid Program investigators through five general aims. First, the program will continue providing access to state- of-the-art RNAi vectors and CRISPR-Cas9 vectors and procedures for analyzing either single gene knockdowns or for performing pooled RNAi/CRISPR screens. Second, the Core will provide Program investigators with access to the mouse and human version 5 shRNA library and will compile sub-libraries upon request. Third, the Core will construct custom CRISPR-scanning libraries for performing structure-function analysis on genes of interest within each Program. Fourth, the Core will produce custom domain-focused CRISPR libraries to allow for interrogation and discovery cancer drug targets in various contexts. Fifth, the Core will carry on its efforts to improve CRISPR-Cas9 technologies, and make those innovations available to the Program and to the scientific community at large.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Calcium oxalate kidney stone disease occurs in approximately 9 % of the U.S. population and contributes significantly to health care costs. Small reductions in urinary oxalate excretion are thought to limit stone risk. Recent studies have indicated that a lack of Oxalobacter formigenes colonization is a significant risk factor for calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. Our Preliminary data shows that healthy human subjects lacking O.formigenes can be readily colonized with live preparations of O.formigenes. This ability to colonize individuals offers a powerful means of assessing responses to varying diets before and after colonization. It is still not clear under what conditions O.formigenes modifies stone risk, and much still needs to be learned about how t h i s o r g a n i s m establishes and maintains gut colonization. In the previous funding cycle we identified in a mouse model conditions that influence the growth of O.formigenes in the gut, its degradation of oxalate in the gut, its effects on the amount of oxalate excreted in urine and into the intestine, and its sustainability in the absence of dietary oxalate. In this application we will extend these findings to humans by examining individuals before and after colonization with O.formigenes. Diets controlled in their contents of oxalate, calcium and other nutrients, including a diet ultra-low in oxalate, will be used to examine the interaction between diet, O.formigenes colonization and urinary oxalate excretion. This proposal will use spinach that contains carbon 13-oxalate to accurately determine whether colonization modifies the response to an oxalate-rich meal. Continuous intravenous infusions of the stable, non-radioactive oxalate isotope, 13C2- oxalate, before and after colonization will directly determine if gastrointestinal oxalate secretion occurs and whether colonization influences such secretion. Recent evidence suggests individuals are colonized with different strains and in some cases more than one strain. However, it is not known whether the biological differences between strains influence colonization persistence and urinary oxalate excretion and this will be examined in this application. If the specific aims are successfully completed they will provide valuable information about the importance of O.formigenes colonization in influencing oxalate levels, will create insight into the factors that impact O.formigenes colonization, and will help identify new strategies for modifying the gut milieu and calcium oxalate kidney stone risk.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), is an inflammatory musculoskeletal disease than can lead to joint damage and disability and up to 45% of patients don't respond to biologic therapies. Major hurdles are a limited understanding of mechanisms causing inflammation and bone damage and the absence of markers that predict treatment response. Circulating osteoclast (OC) precursors (OCP), progenitors of bone resorbing OC, are increased in PsA blood and joints and these cells express membrane DC-STAMP, a molecule required for OCgenesis. DC-STAMP has an inhibitory motif (ITIM) in the cytoplasmic tail that regulates signaling. Our overarching hypothesis is that DC-STAMP regulates multiple steps during OCgenesis, has strong potential as a therapeutic target and may serve as an early response marker in inflammatory arthritis. To address these hypothesis, we plan 3 Specific Aims: Aim1: Regulation of cell-fusion and signaling by DC-STAMP during OCgenesis. Hypothesis: DC-STAMP is essential for early cell fusion, but negatively regulates late-stage osteoclastogenesis via ITIM inhibition of Ca+2 signaling and NFATc1 activation. To test this hypothesis, we will light activate chimeric rhodopsin-DC- STAMP chimeras with and without the ITIM, transfected into DC-STAMP-/-murine macrophages and analyze the ITIM effect on cell fusion and downstream signaling at different time points during OCgenesis. Aim2:Functional characterization of DC-STAMP+ monocytes in murine arthritis . Hypothesis: DC-STAMP+ monocytes promote synovial inflammation and bone destruction in the TNF-Tg mouse model of inflammatory-erosive arthritis. To test this hypothesis, bone marrow cells from WT or DC- STAMP-/- mice linked to GFP will be transferred into lethally-irradiated TNF-Tg mice and TNF-Tg bone marrow into irradiated DC-STAMP-/- mice. Joint inflammation and damage will be evaluated by clinical evaluation, Doppler Power ultrasound (PDUS)/micro-CT, and histologic analysis at different time points. The ability of the DC-STAMP 1A2 Ab to ameliorate or prevent arthritis onset will also be analyzed in these mice. Aim3: Assessment of DC-STAMP as an early treatment response marker in PsA. Hypothesis: Change in monocyte DC-STAMP expression at 2 weeks will predict long-term response to TNFi. To test this hypotheses, DC-STAMP monocyte expression in PsA and PDUS of inflamed joints will be assessed at baseline, 2 and 16 weeks after starting a TNFi or MTX. The primary outcome measure will be the change in the Disease Activity in PsA (DAPSA) at 16 weeks. The change in DC-STAMP at 2 weeks will be correlated with change in DAPSA and PDUS scores at 16 weeks. These studies will provide insights into key mechanisms that underlie PsA and catalyze biomarker discovery. Our results will also lead to therapies that target the DC-STAMP signaling pathway with potential to impede pathologic bone degradation in PsA, osteoporosis and other inflammatory bone and joint disorders.\",\n",
       " 'SUMMARY Once considered a death sentence, infection with HIV is now a manageable, chronic disease. To keep the viral load low and to prevent progression to AIDS, patients are required to adhere to a regime of multiple antivirals for life. Long-term treatment does not eliminate the virus and can lead to serious toxicities. Therapies that either cure infection or that offer improvements in convenience or tolerability are needed. Current anti-HIV therapeutics target fewer than half a dozen protein active sites. Significant recent advances in the structural biology of HIV offer an opportunity to develop therapeutics that target tertiary structures within the HIV RNA genome that are essential to the viral replication cycle. RNA is a compelling target for small-molecule drug discovery, and the genomes of RNA viruses, such as HIV, contain highly conserved targetable structures. Multiple natural products target ribosomal RNA, establishing proof of concept for RNA as a drug target; however, RNA-targeted drug discovery remains a nascent field. Specific tertiary structures in the HIV RNA genome are essential for viral replication, and we are ideally positioned to develop a screening system for small molecules that bind to these tertiary structure elements. The well-characterized Rev response element (RRE) forms a complex with Rev protein that is essential for export of HIV RNAs from the nucleus, a process necessary for productive infection. We will employ the Ribometrix lead discovery platform to identify small molecules with favorable medicinal chemistry properties that bind to the RRE to block binding of Rev or to disrupt the tertiary structure recognized by Rev. These leads will serve as a foundation for development of novel anti-HIV therapeutics. At Ribometrix, our lead discovery platform combines SHAPE-MaP, a high-quality, rigorous biophysical technology for RNA structure analysis, and fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), a well-validated strategy for lead compound identification that allows efficient sampling of chemical space. The strategy we propose to develop here can be used in efforts to identify small molecules that bind to and disrupt structures of diverse therapeutically important RNAs. Thus, we are poised to fully test and establish proof-of-principle for an efficient and generic approach for RNA-targeted ligand discovery, focused on a critical step of the HIV replication cycle.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood diagnoses are chronic and devastating with respect to costs to the individual and the healthcare system, and are more prevalent than any other class of disorders. When these disorders present concurrently, the significant public health implications and societal costs are intensified. Despite high rates of comorbidity and underlying mechanistic similarities between treatment protocols, single disorder evidence- based psychotherapy protocols for these disorders have traditionally been recommended to treat emotional disorders sequentially. Moreover, when clinicians are presented with complex case presentations, they are often unprepared to treat them and move away from evidence-based approaches, potentially increasing the burden on the mental health system. The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is an innovative transdiagnostic protocol with promising evidence for successful treatment of emotional disorders, both for standalone and comorbid presentations, including the classification of not otherwise specified (NOS) disorders. To date, there have only been efficacy trials of the UP, which limit generalizability and do not address the larger public health impact and effectiveness in routine clinical care settings with both psychiatric and medical comorbidity. To address this critical limitation, the applicant proposes a pilot feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability study of the UP in patients with diverse psychiatric and medical comorbidity to manualized supportive therapy within a hospital. The deployment focused model (DFM) will inform design and statistical analyses. An additional aim includes determining the feasibility, acceptability, perceived fit and satisfaction of the UP in clinic settings through surveying and interviewing stakeholders in the system that are implementing the UP through the study. Consultation with stakeholders can minimize the time required to collect and assess fit within the larger system and, therefore, minimizes the time lag between science and practice in routine care settings. This study addresses an important public health concern by examining the effectiveness of the UP in a new population as a strategy for treatment of common and debilitating mental disorders in routine care settings. Furthermore, the proposed research aims will complement a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant to become an independent investigator with expertise in implementation science and effectiveness research. Results from the study will provide important information about whether or not this efficacious treatment can be effective, efficient, and ready for implementation in routine care settings in which psychiatric and medical comorbidity are common. This study will also serve as a model of deploying efficacious treatments into generalist clinics.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immunization rates for recommended childhood vaccines have consistently been high, with childhood series completion near 80% by 19-35 months. However, these high immunization coverage rates do not fully account for delays or refusals of early childhood (i.e., less than one year of age) vaccine uptake. Overall, the proportion of children not receiving all recommended vaccines or whose parents are consistently limiting visit-level vaccine administration is increasing. Children who do not receive all recommended vaccines are at greater risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases, which can lead to development of severe sequelae, hospitalizations, and death. Additionally, despite evidence showing the effect of vaccinating pregnant women in reducing disease among infants too young to be fully vaccinated, maternal immunization rates remain low. We developed and pilot tested a novel, innovative, evidence based, and comprehensive immunization intervention at the Practice, Provider, and Patient (P3) levels to meet the diverse and complex information needs of mothers. This P3 intervention included components such as use of practice-level vaccine champions, expanded reminder-recall systems, and provision of practice-level immunization rate feedback (practice-level interventions); physician peer-delivered training related to vaccines, vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccination recommendations, and vaccination system logistics, as well as standardized talking points for use when recommendation vaccination (provider-level interventions); and an interactive tablet computer (iPad) education application for pregnant women to view while waiting for care (patient-level intervention). Our pilot testing found this P3 intervention to be well received by providers and patients and indicated a few areas where the intervention could be improved. In the proposed project, we will develop and evaluate an improved version of the P3 intervention, to be called P3+. Improvements to the initial P3 framework will be based on findings from the original evaluation project as well as additional formative research. We will then evaluate the P3+ intervention in a geographically and socio-demographically diverse set of obstetrician- gynecologist offices in Georgia (community-level practices) and Colorado (offices of the Kaiser Permanente Colorado managed care organization). The research will be led by Multiple PIs who have extensive experienced in understanding and addressing barriers to vaccine uptake. The proposed evaluation will address vaccine uptake both for pregnant women and for their children, through 24 months of age, to test the hypothesis that increasing acceptability of vaccines during pregnancy will lead to positive changes in acceptance of vaccines for children.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): COPD is a leading cause of death in the US and worldwide and patients suffer high morbidity. A better understanding of contributing factors to the progression and burden of this pervasive disease is critical. Despite population-based epidemiological evidence suggesting exposure to ambient air pollutants causes increased hospitalizations and mortality from COPD, there is very little known about the impact of exposure to air pollutants on the progression of disease. For example, the extent to which exposure to air pollution accelerates lung function loss and contributes to patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life and dyspnea in COPD remains largely unknown. SPIROMICS is a unique NHLBI-funded prospective cohort study of COPD phenotypes and markers of disease which plans to enroll 3,200 subjects at seven sites across the US. A subgroup of participants will also record daily symptoms over one year. We propose to add state-of-the art air pollution exposure assessment to determine individual-level outdoor and indoor air pollution exposure for all SPIROMICS participants, providing an extraordinary opportunity to understand effects of air pollutants on COPD morbidity and progression. For Specific Aim 1a, we aim to determine the impact of long-term outdoor air pollution exposure on COPD morbidity, including lung function decline, patient reported outcomes, and exacerbations by employing sophisticated spatio-temporal air pollution prediction models, supplemented with cohort-specific outdoor monitoring data, to precisely predict participants' ambient exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), light absorbing or black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2)) and link with existing health outcomes collected as part of the SPIROMICS study. For Specific Aim 1b, we aim to determine the effect of indoor air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, NOx, SO2, O3, BC and secondhand smoke) on COPD morbidity by conducting indoor air monitoring in a subset of participants' residences. These data will be combined with validated questionnaire data collected on the entire cohort to model indoor exposure for all participants. Personal monitoring will be used to assess measurement error. For Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether short-term changes in outdoor air pollution are associated with day-to-day changes in symptoms and exacerbation risk in 300 subjects recording daily symptoms over a one- year period. For Specific Aim 3 we will examine airway macrophage black carbon content from induced sputum as a biomarker of air pollution (PM2.5 and BC) and determine its association with clinical and subclinical measures of disease severity and prognosis. Our study builds on an established network of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. Findings from this study can provide information to guide public policy and clinical management for individuals with COPD.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developmental language disorders are highly prevalent in the general population. One of the earliest warning signs of many developmental disorders is delayed language acquisition, which is also associated with higher risk for subsequent reading and language disorders. However, little is known about how neural networks underlying language learning develop in early infancy and what neural and genetic mechanisms cause certain individuals to diverge onto an atypical developmental trajectory that leads to developmental language impairments. While there is a small but growing body of research using passive fMRI to examine the neural basis of language in infants (during natural sleep), no studies to date have used a longitudinal design or related early brain-based measures to subsequent behavioral outcomes. Understanding how early brain activity and connectivity relate to later language development may ultimately inform early diagnosis and interventions that will be more effective for treating developmental disorders that affect language. It is therefore essential to characterize the development of the neural networks subserving language acquisition in typically developing infants to serve as a basis for understanding how this system may go awry in developmental disorders such as specific language impairment, dyslexia, and autism spectrum disorders.  Here we propose to use a longitudinal multimodal approach integrating several neuroimaging measures with genetic data to investigate developmental changes in language-relevant networks in the infant brain. By using passive fMRI during natural sleep, we will study infants at two time points: 1.5 and 9 months of age. Prior studies have shown that newborns already demonstrate a preference for their native language and that by 6 months of age, infants can implicitly identify word boundaries in continuous speech by relying on statistical and prosodic cues in the input. Using stimuli analogous to those employed in these milestone behavioral studies, passive fMRI will be conducted to probe the neural signatures of these early linguistic achievements in the infant brain. Resting-state fMRI will also be performed to characterize developmental changes in functional connectivity within language-relevant brain networks. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), deterministic and probabilistic tractography will be conducted to examine the development of specific structural (i.e., white matter) tracts that connect language areas in the developing brain. In addition, we will examine how common genetic risk variants in CNTNAP2 that have been associated with language impairments in neurodevelopmental disorders may affect both activity and connectivity within language-relevant networks. Finally, we will relate th early measures of brain activity and connectivity to behavioral indices of language development assessed longitudinally (from 6 to 24 months of age).  Taken together, the studies outlined in this proposal aim to investigate the functional and structural networks underlying language acquisition in the infant brain, and to further examine how these networks are affected by CNTNAP2, a gene that plays a significant role in the development of fronto-striatal networks subserving language learning. The findings from the proposed research will provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying language learning in typical development and ultimately inform the early detection of altered developmental trajectories, which could lead to more effective interventions due to increased neuroplasticity early in development.',\n",
       " 'This project focuses on the interplay of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-encoded immunomodulators and host defense pathways that control the initial stages of viral infection within the natural host. These cell-autonomous pathways dictate parameters of acute infection, such as tissue tropism and dissemination. They also control establishment of a reservior for life-long persistence and latency and constantly defend against host immune clearance mechanisms. Importantly, we have shown that herpesviruses such as human (H) or murine (M) CMV, as well as herpes simplex virus (HSV)1 and HSV2, all employ evolutionarily related cell death suppressors that block programmed cell death. In MCMV, suppressors prolong infection and enhance spread, providing a tractable model to elaborate the contribution of specific cellular compartments to the ancient virus- host arms race that plays out during natural infection. The host pathways we study are conserved in humans as well as mice, providing key insights that cannot be obtained using HCMV or primate CMV models. Macrophages are important partners for all CMVs, starting from the initial encounter with virus inoculum, proceeding with the orchestration of viral dissemination, resulting in the deposition in sites of persistence and latency, and critical for the reappearence of virus sporadically or as a result of immunosuppression. All of the insights into murine CMV pathogenesis and latency from the studies we propose will point relevant directions for studies in human CMV. Our unique approach involves the use of viruses that lack specific cell death suppressors combined with mice that are deficient in the cognate host defense pathways that these suppressors target. We propose to move to a new phase of study and dissect the contribution of apoptosis, necroptosis and other programmed cell death pathways within specific tissue compartments. These studies are therefore relevant to an expanding range of human pathogens, most immediately HSV and other human herpesviruses. The specific host defense value of necroptosis has recently emerged along with the fascinating observation that this and other cell death pathways are interlaced and interdependent. Necroptosis is capable of completely preventing infection of a naÃ¯ve host because all exposed cells die within hours of exposure. In the next period, we will specifically investigate the contribution of serine protease death pathways that were first brought to light in our studies of HCMV in macrophages. Importantly, the project will determine the contribution of cell death in monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells and epithelial cells during natural infection in mice. As a result, the contribution of specific programmed cell death pathways to all relevant stages of viral pathogenesis will emerge.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Apoptosis is critical for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and for the maturation of various organs in the developing embryo. Failure to activate the cell death program results in embryonic lethality and severe central nervous system (CNS) defects, including hyperplasia of cells in the CNS, exencephaly (protrusion of brain matter from the skull), and incomplete neural tube closure. Although the apoptotic pathway has been well characterized in certain mammalian cell lines, exactly how cell death is regulated in primary embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in the neural precursor cells (NPCs) of the CNS remains largely unknown. In this proposal, I will explore a novel apoptotic pathway engaged by ESCs and NPCs that primes them for rapid death in the developing embryo. This proposal will test the hypothesis that these cells utilize a novel C. elegans-like apoptotic pathway for activating caspases and cell death independently of the mitochondria. In particular, I hypothesize that, similar to what is observed in cells undergoing apoptosis in the developing C. elegans embryo, ESCs and NPCs express a previously uncharacterized short form of the pro-apoptotic protein, sApaf-1, that exists in complex with, and is inhibited by, the anti-apoptotic Bc-xL protein. In Aim 1, I will investigate how the sApaf-1/Bcl-xL interaction regulates apoptosis in ESCs and NPCs. Specifically, I will examine the physical interaction between sApaf-1 and Bcl-xL and determine whether Bcl-xL inhibition or knockdown is sufficient to allow sApaf-1 to activate caspases and induce rapid apoptosis in both cell types. Importantly, I will test whether this novel pathway in ESCs and NPCs induces apoptosis by bypassing the mitochondria as observed in the C. elegans embryo. In Aim 2, I will investigate the sApaf-1/Bcl-xL apoptotic pathway in the developing brain in vivo. This aim will explore the increased cell death phenotype of conditional knockout mice that are deficient in Bcl-xL in the developing brain, and whether the cell death observed in these animals can be rescued by simultaneous deletion of Apaf-1. The results from this proposal will be important for uncovering key features of ESC and NPC biology that determine how cell death is regulated in early mammalian embryonic development.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Intracellular infections based in the lung alveolar macrophage population remain one of the most challenging anti-infective settings and unmet medical needs. Diseases such as tuberculosis, legionellosis, tularemia and melioidosis cause high mortality and morbidity costs around the globe. The long-term goal of this project is to develop and validate a new inhalable macromolecular therapeutic platform termed ?drugamers? that targets antibiotics and antibiotic drug combinations to the alveolar macrophage to better treat lung-based intracellular infections. A key new property of this platform, that currently does not exist in clinically available therapeutics and delivery systems, is the ability to engineer custom tailored pharmacokinetic (PK) drug release profiles in the alveolar compartment and targeted alveolar macrophages that match the required PK profiles of specific antibiotic classes and specific bacterial infection processes. To achieve this objective, the project brings together a multi-disciplinary team across polymer therapeutics, glycan targeting of alveolar macrophages, and clinical expertise in alveolar-based bacterial pathology and treatment. The initial therapeutic focus is on tularemia and melioidosis, with clinical investigators and access to BSL-3 human pathogen models and facilities. The proposal is structured around 4 specific aims to: (1) Synthetically construct mannose-targeted drugamers of fluoroquinolone, ?-lactam, and aminoglycoside drugs and drug combinations with controlled release profiles and architectural morphologies designed to optimize alveolar macrophage uptake. (2) Optimize the biocompatibility, alveolar macrophage targeting, and PK properties - measured by liquid chromatography ? mass spectrometry analysis - of the drugamer library in murine models based on known drug dosing profiles of these major classes of antibiotics. Select optimized drugamers based on these in vivo properties to carry forward into the surrogate models of tularemia and melioidosis of the next aim. (3) Evaluate in vivo bactericidal efficacy of the mannose-targeted drugamers selected through their winning properties in Aim 2. Drugamers administered by aerosoloization will be tested for their ability to achieve cures in highly lethal mouse disease models infected by controlled aerosolization of surrogate Francisella and Burholderia bacteria. (4) Highly effective drugamer designs selected in Aim 3 will be assessed in human pathogen mouse models using Francisella tularensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei at the University of Washington BSL3 select agent facility. If successful, this project will identify lead inhalation therapeutics for future clinical pathway development against tularemia and melioidosis. Because the drugamer platform is modular, it could also be developed against other unmet intracellular lung infection therapy needs, where the growing issue of drug resistance provides a compelling need for the tailored and combination dosing profiles of this platform.',\n",
       " 'SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The gastrointestinal mucosa functions as an interface between the luminal contents and the underlying tissue compartments, and is thus vital in maintaining mucosal and systemic homeostasis. The gut lumen houses a numerically vast and taxonomically diverse prokaryotic microbiota. In health, the mucosa and microbiota thrive in a mutually beneficial symbiotic arrangement. Both host and microbe have evolved a complex system of mutual perception, response and reaction. These events are mediated in part by the ability of the intestinal epithelia to respond to specific members of the microbiota by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), that serve to activate multiple cellular pathways involved in the maintenance of gut homeostasis. This proposal will employ in vivo systems including extensive use of germ-free mice, or mice gnotobiotically colonized with known ROS inducing bacteria. Additionally, taxonomic analysis of microbiota in neonatal mice will be used to identify other bacteria with functional effects on the gut mucosa. The proposal will study microbial influences on known and novel signaling pathway, and characterize the regulatory effects on gut survival, differentiation and proliferation. Our overall objectives are to define the participants, events, and processes involved in host microbial contact and how this interaction influences intestinal homeostasis, development and restitution. ROS and redox-stimulated pathways likely represent a conserved mechanism by which the host interacts with its commensal microbiota, and thus presents an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation.',\n",

In the past decade, two epidemic ribotypes (RT027 and RT078) of C. difficile have emerged as major ribotypes in hospital outbreaks around the world despite not being observed at significant levels prior to the year 2000. These ribotypes are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and have been classified as hypervirulent. However, the mechanistic basis for why these strains began to emerge in the early 2000s is unclear.  We have found that RT027 and RT078 strains have acquired the ability to grow on the disaccharide trehalose more efficiently than other ribotypes of C. difficile. Our preliminary data shows that the mechanistic bases for the improved growth in these two ribotypes are genetically and mechanistically distinct, suggesting convergent evolution of improved trehalose metabolism in these phylogenetically distinct ribotypes. In addition, we have found that disrupting the ability of a RT027 strain to utilize trehalose dramatically attenuates disease severity, suggesting that trehalose metabolism contributes to the hypervirulent nature of RT027 and RT078 strains. Trehalose, a disaccharide of glucose, became a widely used food supplement after being granted GRAS status approval by the FDA in 2000 and EFSA in Europe in 2001. Trehalose has a number of desirable properties as a sugar additive due to the alpha, alpha 1-1 linkage that is heat and acid stable, which renders it 45% less sweet than sucrose. Normally found in foods such as mushrooms and shellfish, trehalose is now added to numerous food and drink products ranging from ground beef to ice cream.  The addition of trehalose to the worldwide food supply coincides with the first reports of RT027 and RT078 strains in the early 2000s, even though these ribotypes were present in hospitals as far back as 1985. We propose that addition of increased levels of trehalose to the food supply has selected for RT027 and RT078 strains due to their ability to more efficiently metabolize trehalose and has contributed to hospital epidemics. We will use two recently developed models in our laboratory, human fecal minibioreactor array model of C. difficile invasion and a humanized microbiota mouse model of C. difficile infection, to study the impact of trehalose and improved trehalose metabolism on the ability of RT027 and RT078 strains to cause C. difficile infection. We will also investigate the mechanistic bases for improved trehalose metabolism of RT027 and RT078 strains. Finally, we will assess what impact improved trehalose metabolism has on colonization dynamics, disease severity and carriage in animals of these hypervirulent C. difficile ribotypes. The following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1. Investigate the mechanism of how trehalose metabolism by C. difficile increases disease severity. Aim 2. Understand the mechanistic basis for improved trehalose metabolism in RT027 C. difficile. Aim 3. Understand the role of the acquired trehalose operon on RT078 fitness and animal carriage. We expect this work will establish a link between the recent addition of trehalose in the human diet and the emergence of epidemic C. difficile ribotypes. This will provide the first direct evidence of the alteration of the human diet directly impacting the pathogenesis of an enteric infection.',\n",
       " 'Abstract  The innate immune system forms the first line of specific host defense against invading microbial pathogens. Integral to the innate immune response are Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), which recognize conserved determinants expressed by a broad range of pathogenic microorganisms. Among these are the Toll-like receptors, which promote inflammatory signaling and phagocyte recruitment in response to pathogen recognition, and several families of phagocytic PRRs that mediate phagocytic clearance of microbes from infected tissues. Each receptor family contains multiple members that recognize a unique spectrum of microbial components, and collectively they provide protection against a wide range of infectious organisms.  We have identified a novel pattern recognition receptor, BAI1, that specifically recognizes the surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria. BAI1 is a member of a poorly understood family of G- protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), the so-called Adhesion GPCRs. Binding of bacteria to BAI1 triggers their rapid internalization and killing by host phagocytes, through a mechanism involving activation of the small GTPase Rac by the Elmo/Dock GEF complex, which interacts directly with BAI1. Whether and how signaling through heterotrimeric G proteins is integrated into this process is not known, and will be the focus of Aim 1.  An emerging theme in innate immunity is that pattern recognition receptors often cooperate with each other to enhance downstream signaling responses. Our published and preliminary data indicate that BAI1 acts in tandem with the Toll-like receptor TLR4 to promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by phagocytic cells, and the synthesis of a subset of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines/interferons whose expression is mediated by the transcription factor IRF3. In Aim 2 we will determine how signals derived from BAI1 influence TLR4-mediated signaling to drive ROS production and the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes.  The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to define the role of BAI1 in host defense against bacterial infection. In Aim 3, we will characterize the ability of BAI1-deficient macrophages and neutrophils to clear infection in a mouse model of Gram-negative peritonitis. The ability of BAI1 to drive ROS production and cytokine/interferon synthesis in specific myeloid cell subsets during infection will also be determined. Together these studies will provide unique biochemical and physiological insights into a new class of pattern recognition receptor with important functions in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens. Moreover, BAI1 is one of the few Adhesion GPCRs with known physiological ligands, and dissection of its signaling properties will reveal new insights into this poorly understood class of receptors.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Virus-host interactions in the nucleus have long been recognized as playing important roles in determining the course of viral infection. Families of viruses with genomes composed of RNA (e.g. retroviruses and influenza) or DNA (e.g. polyomaviruses, papillomaviruses, adenoviruses and herpesviruses) interact with many of the same host cell pathways. Each virus family has also evolved unique strategies to create a nuclear environment conducive to viral gene expression and productive replication. Investigators studying RNA and DNA viruses often attend separate meetings, and this separation has limited our appreciation of the commonalities in modes of action. This proposal requests funds to assist in partial support of a conference entitled ?Viral Manipulation of Nuclear Processes? that will bring together researchers who work on both RNA and DNA viruses to discuss areas of common interest. The conference is sponsored by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) and will be held at the Double Tree by Hilton Hotel and Suites in the Historic District of Charleston, South Carolina (3-6 December, 2017). This meeting follows three highly successful previous conferences on this topic held in Charleston, SC (2008), in Santa Fe, NM (2011), and in Washington, DC (2014). Outstanding researchers have been invited as speakers, as well as Keynote speakers who will give general interest introductions to fundamental issues of protein structure and signaling in the nucleus. All other presentations will be chosen for oral talks or posters from submitted abstracts. In this way we will ensure that the forefront of research is presented and will encourage participation of younger researchers. The Organizing Committee consists of established leaders from different areas of virology. They will be responsible for selection of speakers from submitted abstracts and choosing recipients of travel awards. A concerted effort will be made at every stage of the conference planning and organization to ensure inclusion of women and minorities. We request funds to cover travel costs and accommodation of junior speakers and provide travel awards for young investigators. This meeting is designed to explore emerging and novel types of host-virus interactions. It will emphasize how viruses alter nuclear architecture, modulate expression of cellular transcripts, manipulate DNA replication and repair machinery, and have evolved strategies to overcome host innate immune surveillance mechanisms in the nucleus. These are significant areas in virology that will provide new insights into viral pathogenesis. Topics will be addressed in five sessions: 1) Viral Manipulation Interactions with Nuclear Architecture, 2) Viral Exploitation of Host Pathways, 3) Viruses and Cancer, 4) Chromatin and Gene Expression, and 5) Host Factors and Countermeasures. The conference will provide a forum for discussion of topical issues confronting virology, and will foster new interactions, particularly between junior and senior investigators working on different virus families. We anticipate that the topics presented will stimulate collaborations across virology and promote exciting new approaches to advance human health.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      While ongoing research has suggested there are disabilities associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), few imaging studies have examined the impact of their co- morbidity in Operation Enduring Freedom-Operation Iraqi Freedom-Operation New Dawn (OEF-OIF-OND) Veterans. Ragsdale et al (2013) have reported both increased PTSD symptoms and functional impairments in a group of Veterans suffering from both mTBI and PTSD, relative to a group of Veterans with PTSD alone. Yet even less research is concerned with the recovery these Veterans experience from treatment. The overarching goal of the present study is to investigate the global functional, psychological, and neural network recovery of the OEF-OIF-OND Veterans with this co-morbidity. Specifically, we propose to investigate changes in OEF-OIF-OND Veterans with both PTSD and mTBI who participate in a meditation intervention designed for Veterans (Inner Resources for Veterans; IRV). First we propose that IRV will be associated with improvements in community integration and quality of life. Secondly, we propose that Veterans completing a course of IRV will experience improvements in PTSD and postconsussive, including depressive, symptoms. Finally, we seek to show that practicing IRV meditation will improve functional connectivity in OEF-OIF-OND Veterans with co-morbid mTBI and PTSD. We believe that this proposal will not only help us define the problems of Veterans with co-morbid mTBI and PTSD more clearly, but also shed light on their potential for recovery afforded by effective treatment.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that 0.5%-1.0% of the U.S. population has epilepsy, and that 20% of patients with epilepsy have medically refractory seizures. Patients with unilateral temporal lobe seizure onsets have an excellent chance of becoming seizure-free following temporal lobectomy. Based on the successful completion of a Pilot Clinical Trial showing that seizure-free rates were in excess of 80% and with acceptable toxicity, there is equipoise for treating well-selected patients with either radiosurgery or temporal resection. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of radiosurgery with temporal lobectomy in the treatment of patients with pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy including freedom from seizures, seizure reduction, neuropsychological outcomes, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Aim 1: To compare the seizure-free outcomes and morbidity of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) for patients with pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy with those of open temporal lobectomy. Our primary hypothesis is that radiosurgery and lobectomy will have equivalent seizure-free rates at 25-36 months following therapy (one-year of seizure freedom beginning 2 years after treatment). The two arms will be considered equivalent if a one-sided 95% confidence interval precludes a decrease in seizure-free rate of 15%. Our secondary hypothesis is that radiosurgery will result in significant reductions in seizures compared to baseline and that by 2 years following treatment the percentage reduction in seizures will be identical for these two treatments. Aim 2: To compare the neuropsychological outcomes in patients undergoing radiosurgery and temporal lobe surgery, in particular with respect to verbal memory function for language-dominant hemisphere treated patients. Our hypothesis is that patients treated for speech-dominant temporal lobe seizures with temporal lobectomy will show significant reductions in verbal memory and those patients treated with radiosurgery will not have significant reduction in measures of verbal memory. Aim 3: To determine what changes occur in the quality of life of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy following radiosurgical treatment as compared with open surgery. Our primary hypothesis is that there will be improvements (comparing baseline with 3 years post- treatment) in quality of life measures in both groups. Our secondary hypothesis is that both open surgery and radiosurgery subjects will undergo transient reductions in quality of life measures caused by treatment effects during the first year following treatment, but that quality of life will improve for subjects who become seizure-free, independent of treatment group. Aim 4: To compare the cost-effectiveness of radiosurgery compared with open surgery. We hypothesize that radiosurgery will be cost-effective compared to temporal lobectomy over the lifetime of the patient. The purpose of this study is to compare two methods of treatment of surgically-amenable epilepsy: standard anterior temporal lobectomy versus noninvasive Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Beyond the main outcome of the number of patients rendered seizure-free, we will compare preservation of language functions, quality of life measures, and the cost of treatment.',\n",
       " \"The overarching goals of Dr. Myers' research program are to apply exercise therapy and lifestyle intervention to help restore function, reduce disability, and reduce health care costs in Veterans with chronic disease. These areas include diagnostic and prognostic applications of cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and the physiologic effects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs in patients with chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm disease, spinal cord injury, mild cognitive impairment, and chronic renal failure. He is currently PI on two VA RR&D projects, one entitled, ?PCI Alternative using Sustained Exercise (PAUSE),? and the other entitled, ?Exercise to Prevent Muscle Mass and Functional Loss in Elderly Dialysis Patients (PERFECT).? The PAUSE project extends his work on the clinical applications of rehabilitation in patients with cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in Veterans, and in addition to assessing the physiologic effects of exercise and lifestyle intervention as an alternative to invasive treatment of coronary artery disease, the study addresses the cost effectiveness of non-invasive (lifestyle intervention) vs. invasive (coronary stenting) strategies. The PERFECT trial focuses on the effects of exercise therapy on muscle mass and function in chronic renal failure. Renal failure is an important condition in the VA because of its cost (estimated to be the second most costly condition in the VA), its prevalence (estimated to be 34% higher than the general population), and its devastating effects on physical function and disability. Dr. Myers current work also includes three funded projects involving the effects of exercise therapy in patients with mild cognitive impairment. These studies are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise augmentation strategies along with cognitive training interventions to improve cognitive performance in older Veterans with mild cognitive impairment. Dr. Myers initiated and manages a relational database of clinical, angiographic, and exercise test responses dating back to 1987. This database has been a resource for answering many epidemiologic questions affecting Veterans (termed the Veterans Exercise Testing Study, or VETS). The VETS study is an ongoing, prospective evaluation of Veteran subjects referred for exercise testing for clinical reasons, designed to address exercise test, clinical, and lifestyle factors and their association with health outcomes. Studies from the VETS cohort have addressed the prevalence, temporal trends, and health care costs associated with statin use, obesity, chronic heart failure, cardiac rhythm abnormalities and other chronic conditions, and how these conditions are influenced by fitness and physical activity patterns. Analyses from the VETS cohort have influenced guidelines on exercise testing from major health organizations. He coordinates two other national data bases, a 7-center heart failure cardiopulmonary exercise test consortium, and the AHA/CDC- sponsored Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise: A National Data Base (FRIEND). The FRIEND initiative is designed to develop a national fitness registry in order to better inform clinicians and the public about the importance of physical activity and fitness and their role in the prevention of chronic disease. As Co-PI, he recently completed a 6-year NIH-funded Specialized Center of Clinically-Oriented Research (SCCOR) project entitled, ?Exercise Therapy in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Disease.? The SCCOR program was initiated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to foster multidisciplinary research on clinically relevant topics facilitating basic science findings to be more rapidly applied to clinical problems, with an emphasis on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of a particular disease. This project has particular relevance to Veterans, since it has been shown that the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurism disease in Veterans >60 years is 14.3%, with potentially lethal consequences if the disease is not treated.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using neuroimaging techniques to find biomarkers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related social difficulties will allow for earlier detection of risk: a critical component of identifying which infants need preventive treatment. Neuroimaging may also offer a more sensitive method of predicting and assessing treatment response than focusing only on observable behavior. However, we first need to improve our understanding of typical brain development to identify neural markers that predict individual differences in social behaviors. These neural markers can then become targets for the study of biomarkers of ASD. Better understanding the neural differences associated with ASD and related social difficulties will help to guide the development of treatments that are closely matched to biological areas of deficit and provide promising regions of interest for studies utilizing neuroimaging to predict and assess treatment response. The current proposal is a multi-level (brain function and behavior), longitudinal neuroimaging study of 60 typically developing infants during a critical period in social development. The study will utilize functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain functioning in response to both novel (live social interaction) and well-validated (biological motion) social stimuli at 6 months of age. Identified neural correlates of social stimui will then be applied to predict individual differences in key areas of social functioning in these same infants at 12 months. The applicant's overarching career goal is to conduct research that helps to prevent deficits in social- emotional functioning before they reach clinically impairing levels. The proposed fellowship training is an integral step in this career path. The applicant wil receive intensive training in developmental neuroimaging techniques under the mentorship of a leading researcher in the neurobiology of social cognition and ASD. This project, which combines clinical and developmental research using behavioral and neuroimaging techniques, will provide an ideal vehicle for the trainee to develop as an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, so that her research program can help bridge the gaps between social development, neural systems, and clinical research.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Individual differences in the quantity and quality of parent talk and individual differences in infant visual attention predict later vocabulary development, which in turn has the cascading consequences of later cognitive development and school achievement. The proposed research studies how infants prior to their first birthday begin to learn object names, and does so in a unique approach, focusing on how visual information from the infant perspective coincide with parent naming and on how infant looking behavior selects the data to be aggregated and how that selected data changes incrementally in statistical learning. Toward this goal, we will collect a corpus of infant-perspective scenes from 8-12-month-old infants as they play with their parent in a toy room and as parents naturally name objects during play. We will analyze the referential ambiguity of the scenes that co-occur with parent naming events, by showing the scenes to infants and tracking their gaze direction in free viewing. We will use the gaze data to quantify ambiguity in terms of the uncertainty, correctness, and informativeness of the scenes as to the intended object referent. We will then construct training sets for cross-situational learning experiments from the collected scenes by manipulating the mix of high and low ambiguity trials. We will test a series of hypotheses about how infants aggregate information to learn multiple object names.  Moreover, we will feed the trial-by-trial gaze data of individual infants to models to predict final learning outcomes, with the goal of specifying attentional and memory processes that support learning. Our overarching aim of the project is to show that the infant-perspective scenes co- occurring with early naming events have properties that guide and train infant visual attention and in so doing support the learning of names and their referents through the aggregation of information across multiple naming events.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY  Sepsis poses grave health concerns with no effective prevention or cure. The key stumbling block is the highly complex nature of the disrupted innate leukocyte homeostasis. Disrupted sepsis monocyte homeostasis is reflected in a dramatic early upswing of inflammatory processes followed by a late-phase compensatory tolerance. Disrupted neutrophil homeostasis in sepsis patients is cardinally represented by ?migratory paralysis? in which septic neutrophils lose migratory potential toward bacterial products while retaining migration toward sterile tissues, due to preferential reduction of FPR2 and induction of CCR5. Septic neutrophils also have reduced potential for generating neutrophil extra-cellular trap (NET). Collectively, these disrupted innate leukocyte homeostasis may compromise host defense and exacerbate multi-organ inflammation. However, mechanisms underlying monocyte priming and neutrophil paralysis are poorly understood. Due to their highly dynamic natures, current experimental systems in vitro or animal models in vivo fail to properly capture the disrupted leukocyte homeostasis. The PI?s past systems analyses with experimental and computational approaches reveal a model system that recapitulates the disrupted human leukocyte homeostasis in vitro and in vivo by applying subclinical super-low dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In sharp contrast to the effects of widely used higher dosages LPS which preferentially facilitate monocyte tolerance, Dr. Li?s lab documented that super- low dose LPS ?primes? monocytes for prolonged ?run-away? inflammation. In addition, Li lab observed that super- low dose LPS ?programs? neutrophils into a paralytic state, mimicking septic neutrophils with reduced FPR2, reduced potential of bacterial killing and elevated CCR5. Monocyte priming and neutrophil paralysis by super- low dose LPS can be observed in human blood leukocyte ex vivo. With the cecal ligation and puncture sepsis model, Li lab demonstrated exacerbated sepsis mortality in mice pre-conditioned with super-low dose LPS. Mechanistically, Li lab observed that super-low dose LPS potently reprograms monocytes and neutrophils by disrupting key homeostatic events and molecules. Based on these intriguing observations, the long-term goal is to understand the disrupted innate immune dynamics responsible for the elevated morbidity and mortality of sepsis. As a crucial first step, our key objective is to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the disrupted homeostasis in monocytes and neutrophils. This project plans to test the central hypothesis that monocyte priming and neutrophil paralysis during sepsis are caused by the disruption of key homeostatic molecules and processes. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the disruption of homeostatic molecules such as RelB is responsible for the monocyte priming conducive for increased sepsis mortality. Aim 2 will reveal the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for neutrophil paralysis. Aim 3 will test whether that alteration of leukocyte dynamics may exacerbate, while restoration of leukocyte homeostasis may attenuate sepsis pathogenesis.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY  How sensory and motor signals are integrated in the brain to produce perception of object location remains poorly understood. Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is a candidate site for sensorimotor integration that underlies object localization. Mouse S1 is a powerful system in which to uncover general principles and specific circuit implementations of sensorimotor integration that shape perception of object location. Revealing these will provide fundamental knowledge of healthy cortex function from which processing disruptions from stroke, spinal injury, and other neurological disorders may be more fully understood.  The long-term goal of this work is to understand cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying tactile perception. This proposal focuses on how S1 integrates sensory and motor signals during active touch behaviors. Head-fixed mice can determine the angular position of objects by active exploration with a single whisker. Sophisticated neural processing underlies this simple behavior, which makes it an excellent model system for dissecting circuit mechanisms of somatosensory integration. Several competing models exist for how the brain solves this task. They differ in the type, origin, and integration location of sensorimotor signals used. Distinguishing between these models is critical for understanding the role internal motor signals in cortical circuits play in construction of tactile perception. Prior studies failed to do so because of limitations in task design and quantification of behavioral variation. This proposal overcomes these limitations with innovative approaches that include an improved localization task, high-speed sensorimotor tracking, cell type- specific electrophysiology, calcium imaging, sophisticated decoding models, and closed-loop optogenetics.  The overall objective of this proposal is to distinguish between sensorimotor integration models by quantifying behavior, identifying candidate codes for object location in S1, how these are constructed, and their influence on perception. Our central hypothesis is that object location is encoded by the set of excitatory neurons activated by touch in L5B of S1, and that object location tuning in L5B cells requires both thalamic input and motion-subtracted touch signals from L4 of S1. We further hypothesize that M1 input amplifies L5B activity without affecting object location tuning. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data including cell-type and layer-specific recordings in S1 and optogenetic circuit manipulation during object localization. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims. 1) Identify candidate codes for object location in S1 neurons. 2) Identify the origin of signals contributing to object location tuning in S1 neurons. 3) Test object localization models with closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of S1 circuits. The contribution of the proposed research will be significant because it will generate detailed knowledge about the neural dynamics in S1 that underlie touch perception, uncover general principles of sensorimotor integration and specific cortical circuit implementations of that integration during behavior, and package it all into a publically accessible resource.

       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a significant stigma attached to mental illness in the U.S. and this stigma is believed to contribute to an estimated 41% of individuals with serious mental illness who are not in treatment. To address this problem, California recently launched a $60 million publically-financed mental illness Stigma and Discrimination Reduction (SDR) initiative. The SDR draws from theories of mental illness stigma reduction and a growing but methodologically limited body of evidence examining similar efforts in other countries. The California initiative's centerpiece is a major social marketing campaign, supplemented by targeted local outreach to general audiences, stakeholders, and key influence groups. Activities are expected to reach millions of individuals across the state. Targeted outcomes are improved mental illness knowledge, reduced public stigma, and increased early identification and treatment-seeking for those with symptoms of mental illness. The effort has already been touted as a model for the nation. We propose to test the effects of the SDR initiative on CA adults experiencing mild to severe symptoms of mental distress by 1) tracking levels of mental illness related self-stigma and experienced discrimination in this population from mid to post initiative, 2) testing whether any shifts in illness recognition, treatment seeking, and functioning in this group are greater than shifts experienced by comparable individuals residing in other states, and 3) testing for processes explaining any observed shifts in self-stigma and treatment seeking. We plan to leverage data from a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of CA adults (N=1258) and a mid-initiative benchmarking survey of a representative sample of CA adults experiencing mental distress (N=1066), both conducted as part of the legislatively mandated evaluation of the SDR. We will supplement these with a post-initiative cross-sectional survey and data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) collected pre and post initiative. Propensity matching the NSDUH samples of California adults with NSDUH participants outside the state will provide an equivalent comparison. The research is a unique opportunity to test the effectiveness of a major mental health initiative, will enhance our scientiic understanding of stigma reduction efforts and their mechanisms of action, and have important implications for the design of future initiatives employing stigma reduction as a method of improving mental health.\",\n",
       " \"Chronic musculoskeletal pain creates a significant public health burden, and Veterans are disproportionately affected. The frequency and extent of co-occurrence of pain and PTSD, pain and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), all three conditions (Post-deployment Multi-symptom Disorder (PMD), and other multi-symptom syndromes can complicate and reduce the effectiveness of pain treatment. Furthermore, the majority of Veterans do not seek care in VA settings, requiring an approach that will be available to all Veterans. The Blueprint for Relieving Pain in America and National Pain Strategy call for the promotion of self-management; reducing disparities among vulnerable subgroups (e.g., Veterans); and the tailoring of pain care. Proponents of integrated treatment for common co-morbid conditions are advocating for interventions that address multiple conditions. This Phase II proposal builds on a successful NACTS-funded Phase I SBIR that developed and pilot tested a theoretically-grounded, mobile- optimized, interactive pain self-management intervention for Veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Health eRide: Your Journey to Managing Pain 1) was tailored specifically to Veterans' readiness and preferred strategies for pain self-management; 2) leveraged SMS messaging, social networking, and gaming principles to increase engagement and retention; and 3) helped to address the co-occurrence of PTSD and TBI by including health behavior change messages for sleep hygiene and stress management. At 30-day follow-up, participants (n=44) reported significant reductions in pain and pain impact, as well as increased readiness to employ self-management strategies. Over 68% of participants reported favorable global impression of change. Phase II will involve 1) completing the development of Health eRide by transforming it into an app and enhancing its functionality for mobile browsers, enhancing the social networking and gaming features, and adding e-coaching capabilities; and 2) conducting a year- long randomized trial in which 540 Veterans with chronic pain recruited from both VA facilities and the community are randomly assigned to Health eRide or an online educational cognitive- behavioral therapy intervention. Differences in pain intensity and interference will be examined at 6 months (immediately post-intervention) and 12-months. A number of secondary analyses will be conducted to examine the impact Health eRide has on other outcomes (e.g., PTSD symptoms). A successful trial will set the stage for widespread dissemination of an efficacious, easily accessible tailored pain self-management intervention to address an urgent need among our nation's Veterans as well as an adaptation for general adult populations.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing biochemical evidence suggests that cell membranes segregate their components into nanoscopic platforms or 'rafts' to control signaling and trafficking across the membrane. Signaling is a key function of the cell, and it is unsurprising that raft formation has been proposed to influence a wide range of diseases, such as Alzheimer's, influenza, and diabetes. This project will shed further light on this issue by accomplishing 3 different aims. The development of a new microscopy technique capable of imaging membranes at nanometer scale and microsecond times- The limiting factor in current studies of lipid rafts is the limits of current imaging techniques. The characterization of model membranes at the nanoscale- Model membranes, composed of a just few components, will provide valuable information on the lipid interactions that drive the formation of lipid rafts Imaging live cells- Live cells will be imaged, and their nanoscale membrane structure correlated to the position of proteins known to associate with rafts. This will provide information on the actual behavior of cell membranes in organizing proteins. This project will answer questions about how cells are organized that will have immediate impact on the understanding of many diseases. This project will also develop tools that will enable many future experiments on how disease affects the functioning of a cell.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION:     Rationale and Preliminary Data: We will conduct a validation and characterization of the diffusion tensor imaging changes and histopathology of the cervical spinal cord following experimental thoracic contusion injury. Conventional MRI scans to detect edema using T2-weighted imaging are no better at predicting the degree of recovery in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) than a traditional neurological examination. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is showing promise as a prognostic imaging biomarker in SCI. However, DTI at the injury site is often hampered by artifacts from spinal fixation hardware. Our preclinical studies in the rat have demonstrated robust DTI alterations in the high cervical spinal cord (hcDTI) that correlate with injury severity and functional recovery. Thus, our preliminary data indicates that diffusivity in te high cervical spinal cord, as measured by DTI, is a potential biomarker of neural injury in SCI. While promising, a more comprehensive validation is necessary for accurate diagnosis in human SCI. To that end, we will employ our preclinical model of thoracic contusion injury to advance the understanding of the DTI changes in the cervical cord as markers of injury. Hypothesis and Specific Aims: We hypothesize that advanced MRI of the high cervical spinal cord is an accurate biomarker of tissue damage and injury severity that is prognostic of outcome. To examine this hypothesis, we will employ a rat model of thoracic contusion spinal cord injury and perform in vivo MRI, functional assessments, and histopathology. We will test our hypothesis by performing diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and quantitative T2 (qT2) to improve the prognostic ability in the acute setting (Aim 1), establish these measures as a surrogate maker of tissue damage at the site of injury (Aim 2), and elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of MRI changes remote from the site of injury using gold-standard histopathology (Aim 3). To accomplish these aims, a multidisciplinary approach using in vivo DKI and qT2, quantitative histopathological analysis, and functional assessments will provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between noninvasive imaging markers and their biological underpinnings and functional implications. We hypothesize that detection of injury in the acute setting will be enhanced by DKI and qT2 MRI techniques. Furthermore, it is believed that the cervical cord DTI changes accurately reflect the degree of injury at the site of injury assessed by the amount of spared white matter. Finally, it is postulatd that in addition to axonal degeneration and demyelination, astrocyte reactivity is a prominent feature of injury that occurs distant from the injury and relates to the degree of functional recovery. Collectively, these studies will establish and validate hcDTI as a sensitive biomarker of SCI with the potential to improve prognostication and will guide translation to human SCI.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) face extreme challenges as they adapt to both arthropod and vertebrate hosts. Arboviruses acutely infect humans and a wide range of other vertebrates, but must persistently infect one or two mosquito species for transmission to their next vertebrate host. Due to interhost cycling, arboviruses encounter vast differences in immune responses and RNA interference (RNAi), mediated by small RNAs. In contrast to in vertebrates, RNAi is the main antiviral response in insects, targeting RNA virus genomes for degradation to limit viral replication. Because of the disparate nature of RNAi in vertebrates versus mosquitoes, strategies for arboviruses to evade and subvert these responses should be equally divergent depending on the host. Therefore, we hypothesize that arbovirus:small RNA interplay will vary radically between mosquito and mammalian hosts. As a model arbovirus, we plan to study chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which causes a painful, debilitating illness, for which there is no vaccine or treatment. The main goal o this proposal is to understand CHIKV interaction strategies with disparate host RNAi components and responses. This work aims to advance our understanding of host-specific small RNA interactions with arboviruses, beginning with CHIKV.  Recently, we collaborated with the Darnell lab at The Rockefeller University to apply cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of Argonaute (Ago; termed Ago-CLIP) to virus-infected cells. Ago proteins are essential to all RNAi pathways, and are guided by small RNAs to bind to mRNA or viral RNA targets. Using Ago-CLIP, we can physically map small RNA-mediated Ago binding to viral genomes. This technique offers a unique opportunity to examine functional differences in host species' small RNA interactions with arboviruses. In our specific aims, we propose to use Ago-CLIP to map small RNA-mediated Ago binding to the CHIKV genome in both mammalian and mosquito models 1) in vitro and 2) in vivo, with special attention to interactions relevant to mosquito antiviral responses. Our understanding of arbovirus:host interactions is limited, particularly in mosquito vectors, and has been a major impediment to the development of antiviral control strategies. Our aims will allow us to identify critical CHIKV:small RNA interactions, which may uncover novel drug targets. Furthermore, observation of such small RNA interactions will increase our understanding of determinants of tropism and may inform strategies for disrupting arbovirus transmission. On a global level, systemic mapping of small RNA landscapes for arboviruses will yield insights into the interplay between viruses and antiviral defenses in disparate hosts.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in the understanding of alterations in brain and behavior in adult affective psychopathology, and the more recent conceptualization of these illnesses as neurodevelopmental in origin, there is a dearth of early developmental data to inform this trajectory. The current proposal aims to fill this gap using data from a unique 13 year prospective longitudinal study, which started in the preschool period and contains three waves of functional and structural scan data: the Preschool Depression Study [PDS]. The proposed extension of this PDS study will focus on three constructs/RDoC domains encompassing specific aspects of emotion reactivity and regulation thought to be central to the development of affective psychopathology: 1) Negative Emotion Reactivity (NER), 2) Reward Reactivity (RR), and 3) Cognitive Emotion Re-appraisal (CER). Data from this sample has already shown that children who were depressed as preschoolers show similar alterations in brain structure and function relevant to the three constructs of interest as established in depressed adults. Brain markers of later recurrence, over and above behavioral symptoms have also been identified. Importantly, both hormonal and psychosocial factors influenced behavior and brain structure/function in the data to date. Follow-up of this unique sample with two additional waves of imaging and comprehensive assessment of these constructs, including measures of hormones, as they pass through adolescence represents an unprecedented, but time limited, opportunity to investigate early developmental antecedents and predictors of adolescent affective psychopathology. The proposed study will directly target the constructs of interest using parent and child report, direct behavioral assessments, and reward and emotion reappraisal tasks during fMRI scanning, as well as structural imaging and resting state functional connectivity, using tools developed in the Human Connectome Project. Using latent growth curve modeling approaches, we will test the hypotheses that specific patterns of individual differences in trajectories of the neural circuitry supporting NER (e.g., insula, hippocampus, amygdala), CER (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate and RR (e.g., striatum, insula) measured during preschool, school age and/or early adolescence predict: (1a) measures of the same constructs in mid to late adolescence; and (1b) risk for reoccurrence or new onset of affective psychopathology in adolescence, over key phenomenological and psychosocial variables assessed from preschool to school age. We will also test the hypothesis that pubertal timing and hormonal factors interact with both adaptive and impaired forms of NER, RR and CER to contribute to the emergence of sex differences in affective psychopathology during the high-risk phase of adolescence. This work will allow an investigation of the role of early childhood emotion and brain function in the course and trajectory of adolescent affective psychopathology, identification of potential markers of risk and pathways for early intervention, as well as potential mechanisms driving sex differences that emerge at this period.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Preterm birth, the leading cause of neonatal mortality in the United States, is also associated with a number of chronic health conditions and developmental disabilities that cause lifelong consequences. In Puerto Rico, the preterm birth rate is 17.7% of live births. At 50% above the U.S. average, it is the highest rate of any United States jurisdiction, below only Malawi (18.1%) globally. The researchers investigations suggest that the higher preterm birth rates in Puerto Rico cannot be explained by changes in obstetric practices, and that there is compelling preliminary evidence that exposure to hazardous chemicals contributes to preterm birth. Puerto Rico has 16 active Superfund sites and 200+ hazardous waste sites. Risk of exposure to contamination is high as many of these sites are unlined landfills that overlie Karst aquifers which present highly susceptible pathways for exposure to contamination.    PROTECT (Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats) brings together multidisciplinary researchers study the transport, exposure, health impact and remediation of contaminants, with particular attention to chlorinated solvents and phthalates commonly found at Superfund sites, as both suspect and model agents in the high to preterm birth rates in Puerto Rico. To do so, PROTECT uses an innovative, holistic, source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological, toxicological, and analytical, fate-transport, and remediation studies along with a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized, indexed data repository and a data management system. Administrative, research translation, training and community engagement cores engage and inform stakeholders, provide knowledge-transfer activities to the greater SRP and environmental health community, and provide extensive cross-disciplinary training. PROTECT is responsive to NIEHS, EPA and CDC strategic goals, and addresses priority areas identified by the Institute of Medicine Committee on preterm birth.    Since the Center's inception in 2010, PROTECT researchers have obtained significant and novel results indicating 1) extensive groundwater contamination in the northern Karst region of Puerto Rico; 2) potential mechanisms by which chemicals can stimulate preterm birth; and, 3) suspect chemicals that are elevated in the women in this study. The investigators have also developed a new environmentally-friendly technique for efficient decontamination of groundwater and an improved large-volume urinalysis technique. Research results have been documented in over 50 journal papers and 2 full patent applications. In addition, over 480 pregnant study subjects have been enrolled (200 of whom have completed their pregnancies), and over 70 trainees have participated in the Center. PROTECT will build on these successes with continued research and training to provide the much needed understanding of the role of hazardous chemicals and other environmental factors in preterm birth, and to develop new methods for contaminant remediation in Puerto Rico and beyond. This work will advance environmental health science in general, and potentially lead to a reduction in preterm birth rates.\",\n",
       " \"Project Summary/Abstract The Harvard University TH Chan School of Public Health, in partnership with the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, propose a comprehensive program of research, education and training in the management of hazards associated with emerging technologies. The proposal includes two new graduate level Master of Public Health degree programs, internship opportunities for undergraduate and graduate trainees, support for pilot research projects on hazards of new and emerging technologies, research in development and application of new detection technologies, and professional continuing education and distance learning programs. The program will prepare professional practitioners and researchers to address the evaluation, handling, and management of hazardous substances and conditions associated with emerging technologies such as nanotechnology, electronic waste, drug delivery in healthcare, and sustainable remediation. The overall objectives of the proposed research education program are fourfold: to develop an academic curriculum on occupational health and safety and hazardous substances and leadership in sustainability and environmental management related to emerging technologies; to train a cohort of students in graduate (MPH degree) programs, as well as executive and professional continuing education and distance learning on hazards associated with emerging technologies; to disseminate the results and findings of this research and education; and to evaluate the effectiveness of the training provided. The research education program will provide traineeships to program participants recruited from undergraduate institutions with particular emphasis on under-represented populations, as well as full-time trainees in the graduate (MPH) programs. Research opportunities on hazards associated with new and emerging technologies will be supported through the pilot project program, and we will research development and application of new detection technologies through the Harvard Sensors for Health project. The research education program will be developed in consultation with and evaluated by the HSPH Office of Educational Programs and the Committee on Educational Policy, as well as an external advisory board comprised of stakeholders in health and safety considerations of emerging technologies including academics, business and industry, government, labor, and not-for-profit organizations. This consultation and evaluation will assure that the research education is relevant to the Superfund Research Program's commitment to short courses, continuing education, and graduate training on health and safety management practices for emerging technologies.\",\n",
       " \"Background: Contextualizing care is the process of adapting care plans to patients' individual needs and circumstances. For instance, a plan to address poorly controlled diabetes is contextualized when it addresses possible barriers to self-care, such as visual problems that create physical barriers to medication self-administration, or competing responsibilities that interfere with scheduled appointments. Conversely, a failure to attend to contextual factors, such as increasing the dosage of insulin rather than addressing the obstacles to adherence when present, is termed a ?contextual error? because it is an inappropriate plan of care that can lead to clinical deterioration and greater health care cost. Identifying contextual errors requires listening to an audio recording of the encounter and coding the audio for specific indicators of context and clinicians' attention to them. Evidence indicates that inattention to patient context is common, adversely impacts health care outcomes, increases costs through overuse and misuse of services, and creates obstacles to patient adherence to care plans. An extensive program of research on contextual errors and how to prevent them has culminated in a VISN 12 funded quality improvement initiative that is based on audit and feedback, in which audio recorded data is collected by Veterans on provider attention to care planning, analyzed and organized using Content Coding for Contextualization of Care (?4C?) system and fed back to PACTs and clinicians to facilitate continuous quality improvement.  Objectives: To identify the most efficient, effective, and acceptable data driven strategy for improving contextualization of care in VHA through an implementation and efficacy study of the expansion of an audit & feedback for contextualizing care intervention package (?package?) in VISN 12. The study will assess the efficacy of the intervention package at two levels of intensity, the effectiveness of implementation strategies, and the potential of the intervention to pay for itself by reducing unnecessary care.  Design: We propose an Effectiveness-Implementation type 2 hybrid design because we have two co-primary aims: optimizing implementation and evaluating the intervention's effectiveness. In addition, we seek to document the costs and cost savings of the intervention package to ascertain its budget impact. The project will utilize the RE-AIM implementation-evaluation framework to assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance of the intervention. The project will add four additional sites to the two currently engaged in the package, two in VISN 12 and two outside. The rollout of the package will follow a randomized stepped wedge design comparing baseline at the 4 new sites (no intervention) to both a standard and enhanced feedback intervention, with the latter more intensive but more costly.  Analysis: Assessment of efficacy will measure impact on contextualization of care rates, health care outcomes, and costs, the latter through a budget impact analysis. Assessment of implementation will employ survey and focus group methods to identify and address obstacles to implementation, optimizing the extent to which it is perceived as safe, not burdensome, and valuable by clinicians and patients.  Impact: This project takes a decade of research on contextual error and a recent pilot project to prevent them, and applies that work to the refinement and assessment of a strategy for reducing these errors with an approach that may be scalable and transformative for the Veterans' care. By focusing on ?novel strategies to change provider behavior within the context of a learning health care system,? it is a response to the Provider Behavior RFA. It is also aligned with the VHA's new Blueprint for Excellence which seeks, through ?performance improvement?to improve not only the care, but the health and well- being of individuals.?\",\n",
       " \"Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care: by identifying a colonoscopy bowel preparation regimen which is the most effective in real-world VA practice and can be immediately implemented on a VA-wide scale, the proposed study will maximize the effectiveness of colonoscopy in reducing colorectal cancer (CRC) risk among veterans, increase veteran satisfaction, and reduce VA healthcare cost. Background: CRC is a leading cause of cancer-related death among veterans. Colonoscopy can effectively reduce CRC incidence and mortality. However, non-adherence to screening colonoscopy substantially undermines this benefit. Existing evidence indicates that a disagreeable bowel preparation is a leading barrier to completing a colonoscopy from the patients' perspective. The taste and the volume of the bowel preparation determine patient tolerability and compliance to the preparation instructions, which in turn affects the incompletion (e.g., cancellation/no- show/reschedule) rate of scheduled colonoscopies as well as the effectiveness of the completed colonoscopies and patient satisfaction. The two most commonly used preparations currently in the US are the split-dose 4L polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the split-dose 2L MiraLAX/Gatorade preparations. While a high- volume regimen may in theory be more effective than a lower volume one, it may be associated with lower tolerability and adherence in real-world practice. Three small trials have compared these two preparations. However, data from these explanatory trials cannot inform policy decisions because they were conducted under artificial conditions, restricted among narrow patient populations, and most importantly not designed to capture the full impact of bowel preparation on the completion rate or effectiveness of colonoscopy. To address this critical knowledge gap, we are proposing a pragmatic trial to determine the optimal split-dose bowel preparation in the general veteran population. Objectives: to compare the real-world effectiveness of the two most commonly used split-dose colonoscopy bowel preparation regimens in the US (i.e., 4L PEG and 2L MiraLAX/Gatorade) with respect to the completion rate of scheduled colonoscopies, adenoma detection rate and secondarily preparation quality, cancellation/no-show rate and patient-oriented outcomes (e.g., willingness to repeat the preparation). Methods: the study will be a pragmatic randomized controlled trial comparing the two existing bowel preparation regimens in a large regional VA healthcare system. All veterans who are > 18 years of age and undergoing an outpatient elective colonoscopy are eligible. This pragmatic trial will be conducted with a waiver of informed consent. Providers who are ordering a colonoscopy at the point of care will be asked to choose between allowing the patient to be enrolled in the study or continuing with the current standard 4L PEG within the context of the VA electronic medical records (EMR) ordering menu. Enrolled patients will be automatically randomized through the EMR at the point of care to one of the two bowel preparation regimens, and a pre-populated order for the assigned preparation will then be presented instantaneously to the provider in the EMR for signature. Outcomes and covariates data will be collected directly from the EMR. The primary endpoints are overall completion rate of scheduled colonoscopy and adenoma detection rate, and the secondary endpoints are cancellation/no-show rate, bowel preparation quality and patient-oriented outcomes. Analysis will be based on intention-to-treat. We will also prospectively collect cost data in order to perform an economic evaluation of the two bowel preparation options.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epoxides are three membered cyclic ethers which can be toxic and mutagenic. They are degraded by enzymes known as epoxide hydrolases (EHs), which add water to epoxides to yield more water soluble diols. EHs are widely known for metabolizing xenobiotics, and this project advances our understanding of their fundamental structure, biochemistry and regulation. The soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is the most abundant and active of the EHs in mammals, and it is largely involved in the hydrolysis of endogenous epoxides on natural fatty acids (EpFAs). Since EpFAs are powerful chemical mediators previously shown to reduce inflammation, hypertension, heart failure, and pain, their hydrolysis by the sEH can give rise to disease states. In this project we will test the hypothesis that the levels of EpFA and sEH are influenced by environmental factors, dietary status, and disease states. We also will test if decreasing sEH activity increases EpFA resulting in improved health. In Aim I, we will investigate the biochemistry of the sEH, as well as the microsomal EH (largely responsible for the metabolism of xenobiotics) and the newly discovered EH3. We will determine the relative roles of the sEH, mEH and EH3 in hydrolysis of bioactive EpFA. These biochemical and structural studies will allow prediction of the biological effects resulting from genetic alterations in human sEH. Anti-microbials in some hand soaps and some drugs are powerful inhibitors of the sEH while other environmental chemicals and drugs are powerful inducers. We will determine how these materials alter biologies regulated by the sEH and EpFA. Aim IIA is expanding analytical methods for regulatory lipids altered by disease states, environmental chemicals and drugs. These methods are being used to address the influence of environmental chemicals and nutrition on the sEH. The biochemical tools from Aim I and the analytical tools from Aim IIA will be used in Aims IIB-D to investigate how changes in the sEH and EpFA alter three separate biologies. In IIB we demonstrate that inhibition of the sEH blocks convulsions and reduces perception of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. With pain, inflammation and hypertension, we have shown that sEH inhibitors are more effective in the presence of epoxides of omega 3 rather than omega 6 fatty acids. With an increase in the use of omega 3 lipids as nutraceuticals and value added ingredients, an appreciation of their health effects is critical. We recently demonstrated EpFA from omega-3 and -6 precursors have opposite effects with sEHI on angiogenesis, allowing sEH inhibitors to reduce tumor growth and metastasis when combined with omega 3 EpFA (Aim IIC). This raises the possibly of new cancer therapeutics but cautions that omega 3 lipids could slow wound healing. Aim IID addresses how sEH inhibitors block hepatic fibrosis caused by carbon tetrachloride. We will test the hypothesis that there are common mechanisms underlying the largely beneficial biological effects of reduced sEH activity. The results of this project will illustrate the importance of man' total environment, including both xenobiotic exposure and nutrition, on health.\",\n",
       " 'PTSD affects approximately 14% of OEF/OIF Veterans and leads to considerable personal and societal costs (e.g., increased morbidity, reduced work productivity, poorer relationships). Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for PTSD, a substantial portion (approximately 50%) of individuals drop out prematurely, do not respond to treatment, or relapse. Treatment engagement is worse for OEF/OIF Veterans, who attend fewer sessions and have higher dropout rates than civilians and Veterans from other eras. One likely barrier to treatment engagement and effectiveness is the executive functioning problems present in individuals with PTSD. Executive functions (EFs) are the set of higher-level cognitive skills that organize and integrate lower-level cognitive processes in order to perform complex, goal-directed tasks. PTSD has been associated with EF deficits, including impairments in inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibly, as well as dysfunction in a network of brain regions that support EFs (e.g., prefrontal cortex [PFC], cingulate). EFs are essential for CBT in order to engage the cognitive skills involved in treatment (e.g., self-monitoring, inhibiting distorted thoughts, flexibly generating/evaluating alternative thoughts). This is particularly true for Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), a frontline CBT treatment for PTSD, which involves identifying and challenging maladaptive trauma-related thoughts to alter their impact on emotions and behavior. Thus, EF deficits may lead to reduced CPT engagement and responsivity. In fact, worse EF at baseline has been associated with poorer response to CBT in several disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia). Further, a study of brain functioning during an EF task demonstrated that dysfunction in EF-related brain regions including PFC and cingulate cortex at baseline predicted nonresponse to CBT for PTSD.  Directly targeting EF prior to CPT via cognitive training would strengthen executive networks and likely boost treatment effectiveness, allowing Veterans to fully engage in and benefit more from components of CPT (e.g., cognitive restructuring). Evidence suggests that computerized cognitive training improves EF and functioning in EF-related brain regions, increases mental health treatment completion rates, and enhances response to CBT, though this has not yet been tested in a PTSD population. Thus, the main goal of the proposed study is to examine whether administering computerized EF training (CEFT) immediately prior to CPT will improve executive functioning and enhance treatment adherence, completion rates, and psychological and functional outcomes in OEF/OIF Veterans with PTSD. Objective (neuropsychological) and subjective (self- report) measures of EF will be collected to determine if CEFT enhances EF and if this in turn mediates the relationship between treatment condition and PTSD symptom improvement. Functional neuroimaging during EF tasks will also be collected at baseline to determine whether functioning within an EF network predicts treatment response, above and beyond traditional paper-and-pencil measures of EF. Veterans (N=110) will be randomized to either 12 weeks of CEFT-CPT or a placebo word training condition plus CPT. Assessments will be administered at baseline, immediately after CEFT or word training (prior to CPT), and after CPT completion.  The proposed research aims to reduce barriers to treatment engagement and has potential to significantly enhance current treatments for PTSD by combining cognitive and psychotherapeutic approaches. Targeting EF directly and independently represents a logical, innovative, and empirically-informed method for augmenting existing treatments for PTSD in order to optimize outcomes. Findings from the proposed study will not only directly inform clinical practice, but also have the potential to significantly improve the quality of Veterans? lives, reduce societal costs and burden, improve access to care, and reveal ways to better match individuals with treatments they are most likely to benefit from.',\n",
       " 'Developing effective antiviral drugs requires a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the targeted host-pathogen interaction. Specifically, precise structural models of these interactions can provide mechanistic details with atomic resolution to assist in the efficient development of novel compounds against pathogens of significant health relevance. The influenza virus is a prime example of one such pathogen. Novel strains of the influenza virus develop annually via infection and replication in a number of animal hosts, including humans. The relative ability of these strains to cause disease, or virulence, is determined by a number of interactions between viral and cellular proteins. Although influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is known to play a critical role in virulence, there is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of the genetic and structural determinants that facilitate the multiple strain-dependent functions attributed to NS1 in the host cell. It is therefore our long-term goal to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie strain-dependent function of NS1. The objective of this application is to structurally characterize interactions with two cellular proteins (CPSF30 and RIG-I) that are important for the activation of the innate immune response. Our central hypothesis is that structural and dynamic features unique to certain NS1 variants account for the diverse array of functions attributed to NS1. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that elucidating structure- function relationships between NS1 and its cellular interaction partners will aid in the development of antiviral drugs that target these critical interactions known to modulate virulence. Our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) structurally and functionally characterize the multiple interactions between NS1 and RIG-I, 2) determine the role of microsecond-millisecond (Âµs-ms) motions in proper function of the NS1 effector domain (NS1ED), and 3) determine the mechanism of action by which JJ3297 suppresses influenza replication. In Aim 1, NMR spectroscopy and mutant recombinant influenza viruses will be used to structurally and functionally characterize the multiple interactions between NS1 and RIG-I. In Aim 2, relaxation dispersion experiments will be used to determine the role that protein dynamics play in facilitating the interaction between the NS1ED and CPSF30 and intracellular localization of NS1. In Aim 3, NMR spectroscopy will be used to determine the mechanism of action by which JJ3297 suppresses influenza replication. Our innovative approach will be the first investigation into how protein dynamics and strain specific structural variations facilitate proper function of NS1 in the context of viral replication and pathogenicity. This will also be the first systematic study to determine functional variations in NS1 between multiple strains of influenza. The proposed research is significant because it will define the molecular mechanisms underlying NS1 functions shown to modulate influenza virulence. By defining these molecular mechanisms, this proposal will inform efforts in developing influenza antiviral drugs targeting NS1, thereby supporting the overall mission of the NIH.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is significant interest in the development of 'T cell adjuvants', biocompounds capable of enhancing T cell immune responses against tumors or chronic infections. In order to target diseased tissue for elimination, T cells must recognize antigens via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), and induce a conformational change in the TCR-associated CD3 complex (v). However, the mechanism(s) by which this occurs, and the precise contribution this makes to T cell immunity, are not completely understood. In this project, we propose to elucidate the protein sequences controlling CD3?c in experiments designed to inform new conceptual models regarding the structural aspects of T cell activation. We will focus on the TCR/CD3 subunits, domains, and amino acid sequences involved in CD3?c. Relevant sequences that are discovered in this manner will be mutated and expressed to ascertain their functional contribution to T cell development and activation. We will also determine the contribution that exogenous provision of CD3?c imparts to T cell function, via the use of a new reagent we have generated. This reagent can induce CD3?c without inducing other T cell signaling, and therefore it is inert to non-antigen-engaged T cells. However, the reagent appears to enhance T cell activation by weak antigens, and thus may represent a novel class of 'T cell adjuvant'. We will examine the ability of this reagent to lower the T cell activation signaling threshold, and to enhance T cell-mediated tumor rejection in mice. The information obtained from these studies will advance our comprehension of antigen recognition by T cells, and point toward CD3?c as molecular target with therapeutic potential.\",\n",
       " \"Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare: The Medicare Independence-at-Home (IAH) demonstration which provides frail elderly patients with provider-managed integrated care and supportive services at home has shown reduced rates of hospitalizations, 30-day rehospitalizations, emergency department care, and an average $3,070 annual costs savings per patient. This study will examine if VA's Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) program, the inceptor of IAH, produces similar outcomes among Veterans who meet IAH qualifying criteria (IAH-Q). High HBPC program costs have limited the availability of HBPC and it is currently serving less than 25% of Veterans who meet IAH-Q. This project will provide the Offices of Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC) Policy (10P4G) and Operations (10NC4) with information needed to make informed decisions about effective expansion of the HBPC program, and tools to target Veterans who will benefit from it most. Project Background: The IAH demo is associated with better outcomes and reduced healthcare costs compared to routine care. While VA has operated the HBPC program since the 1970s, it only serves a fraction of the Veterans who meet the Medicare IAH-Q. VA has expanded HBPC from operating in less than half its facilities in 2000 to almost all facilities today. However, the program's reach is still constrained because of the relatively large up-front costs and the lack of readily applicable admission criteria to identify those who would benefit from the program. Further, since over half of the current HBPC enrollees do not meet the IAH-Q, VA needs information on which Veterans should be considered for HBPC so that the program can be available to those Veterans who will likely achieve the most clinical and economic benefit. Project Objectives: One: Does VA's HBPC, when targeted to IAH-Q Veterans, achieve the same clinical outcomes and cost savings as Medicare's IAH-Q beneficiaries receiving Medicare HBPC? Two: Extend the evaluation methods to exploit VA data that was not available to the Medicare evaluation, and include alternative estimation methods to test the robustness of the findings. Three: VA currently provides HBPC to Veterans who do not meet IAH-Q criteria. What is the effectiveness of HBPC in these other groups? Are there non-IAH-Q groups of Veterans for whom HBPC would be cost- effective? Further, what is the variability in the effectiveness of HBPC among IAH-Q Veterans? Four: Develop targeting criteria equivalent to IAH-Q that use only VA data, without relying on data from CMS, to identify Veterans for HBPC enrollment, including refinement of IAH-Q criteria with VA risk measures such as JEN Frailty Index and CAN scores. Five: The CMS demonstration project considered only Medicare expenditures. How does HBPC care affect utilization and costs across Medicare, Medicaid and VA? Project Methods: This project will use Medicare, Medicaid and VA data to capture all relevant utilization and diagnoses. We will identify all Veterans who were potentially eligible for HBPC in 2011. The intervention cohort will be all Veterans who received HBPC in 2012. The control group will be determined from those potentially eligible Veterans who did not use HBPC in 2012 using a direct demographic match, with a propensity score matching based on diagnoses, health services utilization, treatments and prescriptions and MDS or OASIS frailty assessments. We will follow both groups through 2015, comparing functional status, utilization of services, and costs.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Cardiovascular (CV) event prevention (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident) remains the single most important public health problem in the United States, and cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among VA users. Improving the provision of prevention services is a primary focus of the Secretary's New Models of Care Transformational Initiative. However, prevention has been challenging to achieve. Multifactorial behavioral interventions are effective in treating a number of chronic illnesses (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), but less is known about their ability to reduce risk among patients without a unifying chronic illness. Group visits are an efficient, effective strategy for delivering a multifactorial behavior change intervention; the VA is committed to the group visit strategy to address a wide array of primary care problems.  Groups have been shown to be an effective means of improving a number of outcomes in a number of individual diseases, but, again, their role in cardiovascular prevention among patients without a single common illness is unknown. Coaching is a type of multi-factorial behavioral intervention that involves goal-setting, and working to overcome barriers to behavior change. Coaching can be performed one-on-one, but coaching interventions have been delivered in group settings. We have shown, in a 150-subject RCT, that group coaching plus individualized telephone coaching reduces cardiovascular risk, but the population in that study was very different from typical VA users.   We propose a three-site, two-arm randomized trial measuring the effectiveness of a group prevention coaching (GPC) intervention in improving cardiovascular risk, compared to VA usual care. The study will be performed at the Durham, Buffalo, and Syracuse VAMCs. Each arm will have 200 patients; patients will be VA users without prior history of cardiovascular event, but with at least 5% risk of such an event, and with either inadequately controlled hypertension or dyslipidemia, or current smoking. The GPC intervention will focus on changing a behavior of the patient's choice that is likely to lead to improvements in cholesterol, blood pressure, or to smoking cessation. Behaviors that will be reinforced will include but not be limited to healthy eating, decreased caloric intake, increased physical activity, stress reduction, and participatory decision making with physicians. Barriers to these behaviors will be identified. The coach in both intervention arms will adopt a problem-solving approach to overcoming the above barriers and reinforcing the above behaviors; problem- solving is a well-described framework for behavior change. The GPC coach/interventionist for will be either the  facility's Health Behavior Coordinator (HBC) or a  person hired for the research enterprise but trained and  credentialed identically to an HBC.   All  outcomes will be obtained at baseline and 6 months after enrollment by blinded research personnel.  The primary outcome will be change in 10-year risk of fatal coronary event or non-fatal MI 6 months after enrollment, as measured by Framingham Risk Score. Key secondary outcomes will include dietary content by Food Frequency Questionnaire (26), physical activity as measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire (27), and weight. We will also determine if group cohesion, as measured by the Group Dynamics Inventory (28), influences the effectiveness of GPC. We well also assess whether time spent in contact with a coach influences the effectiveness, by database log-in timekeeping strategies.\",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT  Viridans group streptococci (VGS), especially Streptococcus mitis, are pivotal pathogens in a variety of invasive endovascular infections,including: i) ?breakthrough bacteremias? and ?toxic shock? in neutropenic cancer patients; and ii) infective endocarditis (IE). Given world-wide trends in penicillin-resistance and other ?-lactam MIC ?creeps? amongst S. mitis strains, the proportion of serious infections caused by relatively or fully ?-lactam-resistant-(R) strains is disturbing. Moreover, clinical outcomes in such cases utilizing alternate regimens (e.g., vancomycin) have been disappointing, presumably related to the high prevalence of vancomycin ?tolerance? in such strains. This has prompted use of newer bactericidal agents, like daptomycin (DAP) for severe S. mitis syndromes in strains with ?-lactam-resistance. Alarmingly, recent recognition of rapid, durable and high-level DAP-R induced by DAP therapy has significantly reduced enthusiasm for such approaches. In addition, DAP MICs in the S. mitis group are 2-10-fold higher than all other VGS groups. The number of reported clinical cases of invasive S. mitis infections in which DAP-R has emerged is limited, due to the relatively infrequent use of DAP in such infections to-date. However, progressive rise in S. mitis ?-lactam-R plus the inconsistent outcomes of VANC therapy in such syndromes virtually assures increased DAP use, leading to DAP-R S. mitis infections. Moreover, medical centers with high DAP usage have recently confirmed substantial MIC ?creeps? amongst enterococci. Understanding mechanism(s) of emergence of DAP-R in S. mitis, plus strategies to circumvent its evolution are, thus, of great clinical significance.  Our Preliminary Data showed that DAP-R outcomes in S. mitis are likely to be multifactorial on both phenotypic and genotypic levels. Most interestingly, we have now shown compelling evidence of two forms of ?DAP hyperaccumulation? in which individual cells in a given streptococcal chain can hyper-capture DAP and either die (?altruistic suicide?) or resist DAP killing, in order to protect the remainder of the cell population from DAP exposures and lethality. This is an apparently unique mechanism of DAP-R amongst gram-positive pathogens.  In this proposal, we will use strategic fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry with multidimensional physiologic interrogations, and single cell sorting plus genotyping to divulge mechanisms by which DAP-R S. mitis can resist DAP exposures. Finally, we will use two well-characterized models of endovascular infections, ex vivo (chamber model) and in vivo (experimental rabbit IE), to define DAP regimens to both circumvent emergence of DAP-R and enhance clearance of S. mitis. In summary, these studies will divulge clinical strategies to forestall emergence of DAP-R in S. mitis and perhaps other Gram-positive pathogens.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Social recognition in mammals is a complex biological process that necessitates communication between neural circuits mediating cognitive processes such as discrimination of social stimuli and those underlying expression of affiliation or avoidance behaviors. Circuit alterations that impair social discrimination, social interaction or linkage of social discrimination with social interaction may underlie social recognition deficits seen in autism spectrum disorders and other psychiatric disorders. One general mechanism by which distinct behaviors such as reward seeking, social exploration and discrimination of social stimuli are orchestrated is through the actions of neuromodulators such as oxytocin (OT). Although a growing number of studies have begun to shed light on oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) signaling in the nucleus accumbens, lateral septum and prefrontal cortex in social interaction, the contribution of Oxtrs in the hippocampus to social memory is not known. This proposal seeks to identify (i) fundamental circuit mechanisms by which hippocampal Oxtr signaling promotes discrimination of social stimuli and, (ii) the neural pathways that link these computations with circuits that subserve social interaction. Towards these goals, we will harness viral and mouse conditional genetic tools, optogenetics, cellular ensemble imaging and behavior to precisely manipulate hippocampal Oxtr signaling with unprecedented spatial and temporal control and determine its contributions to social recognition. Insights gleaned from the proposed studies will shed light on how an ancient neuromodulator like OT has evolved to utilize basic memory-processing circuit mechanisms to perform discrimination of social stimuli. The significance of the studies lies in its potential to illuminate fundamental neural mechanisms underlying previously unrecognized roles of hippocampal Oxtr signaling in social recognition. Ultimately, these mechanisms may guide novel therapeutic strategies for promoting social recognition in disorders in which it is impaired.',\n",

       " 'Project Summary Synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) are implicated in the formation, specification and maintenance of neuronal connections. Pathway analyses of mutations associated with neuropsychiatric disease implicate synaptic dysfunction as a pathophysiological mechanism, making SAMs important candidates for deeper functional exploration. Studies in humans suggest that Neurexin1? (Nrxn1?), a presynaptically-localized organizer of synaptic architecture, is a partially penetrant genetic risk factor for multiple neuropsychiatric diseases displaying altered goal-directed processing. We demonstrate that Nrxn1? mutants exhibit robust changes in how rewards shape future choices, and may provide a neural circuit framework for understanding inflexible and perseverative actions associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders. This proposal therefore employs genetic, viral, electrophysiological and behavioral approaches in mice to explore how Nrxn1? mutations lead to neural circuit changes capable of altering reward processing. Nrxn1? is widely expressed in brain, but exhibits peak levels throughout cortex and thalamus, sites whose extensive projections to striatum regulate reward processing. Using retrograde-transported viruses or region-specific Cre transgenic mice, together with our Nrxn1? conditional allele, we will ablate Nrxn1? from cortex, thalamus or projection neurons targeting specific striatal compartments. Mice will be tested in our goal-directed tasks to reveal neural circuits wherein Nrxn1? dysfunction precipitates reward abnormalities. To elucidate how these circuits are physiologically altered in Nrxn1? mutants, we will electrophysiologically probe the synaptic strength of cortical and thalamic inputs to the DMS. Preliminary results suggest enhancements in basal excitatory synaptic drive onto both DMS spiny neuron subtypes. Using optogenetic-mediated afferent recruitment and field-normalized synaptic efficacy measures, we will determine input-specific synaptic strength changes in Nrxn1? mutants. Furthermore, we will employ sparse infections of a fused channelrhodopsin-Cre virus into our Nrxn1? conditionals together with acute slice electrophysiology to permit selective recruitment of Nrxn1?-null terminals, thereby gaining mechanistic insight into the cell-autonomous anatomical and synaptic abnormalities caused by Nrxn1? loss-of-function. The mere presence of circuit-specific physiological changes in Nrxn1? mutants does not functionally implicate them in goal-directed dysfunction. To prove this, and broaden our analyses of Nrxn1? disruption to a circuit level, we will use viral-based techniques for activity modulation to see whether mimicking Nrxn1?-associated physiological changes in wildtype mice can produce mutant-like GDB performance or whether counteracting these physiological alterations in mutant mice can suppress the mutant behavioral phenotype. Together, the proposed work investigates how goal-directed neural systems are altered by the synaptic and circuit changes accompanying Nrxn1? perturbation, and may provide a foundation for understanding common circuit changes in reward processing - a key step for circuit-specific intervention.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing biochemical evidence suggests that cell membranes segregate their components into nanoscopic platforms or 'rafts' to control signaling and trafficking across the membrane. Signaling is a key function of the cell, and it is unsurprising that raft formation has been proposed to influence a wide range of diseases, such as Alzheimer's, influenza, and diabetes. This project will shed further light on this issue by accomplishing 3 different aims. The development of a new microscopy technique capable of imaging membranes at nanometer scale and microsecond times- The limiting factor in current studies of lipid rafts is the limits of current imaging techniques. The characterization of model membranes at the nanoscale- Model membranes, composed of a just few components, will provide valuable information on the lipid interactions that drive the formation of lipid rafts Imaging live cells- Live cells will be imaged, and their nanoscale membrane structure correlated to the position of proteins known to associate with rafts. This will provide information on the actual behavior of cell membranes in organizing proteins. This project will answer questions about how cells are organized that will have immediate impact on the understanding of many diseases. This project will also develop tools that will enable many future experiments on how disease affects the functioning of a cell.\",\n",

       " 'PI: Brian Kobilka Structural Basis for Opioid Receptor Function Abstract of Research Plan The most powerful analgesic and addictive properties of opiate alkaloids are mediated by the ÂµOR. As the receptor primarily responsible for the effects of opium, the ?OR is one of the oldest drug targets within the pharmacopeia. Opioid receptors are highly versatile signaling molecules. Activation of the ?OR results in signaling through the heterotrimeric G protein Gi, resulting in analgesia and sedation as well as euphoria and physical dependence. The ?OR can also signal through arrestin, and this pathway has been attributed to adverse effects of opioid analgesics including tolerance, respiratory suppression, and constipation. The ?OR has been the subject of intense focus for drug-discovery efforts over the past century, with the identification of numerous ligands of varying efficacy. These drugs occupy a wide chemical spectrum, from small organic molecules to a variety of endogenous and synthetic peptides. Recently it has been shown that drugs may differ in their ability to promote activation of the Gi or arrestin pathways, a property referred to a ?bias?. It has recently been shown that Gi-biased drugs such as PZM21, identified during the initial funding period, may have better therapeutic profiles than non-biased agonists such as morphine. The goal of research funded by this award is to provide structural insights into biased signaling that will facilitate our ability to develop the next generation of opioid analgesics with fewer adverse effects and less addictive potential. Specific Aims for the next period of funding (described in more detail at the end of the Progress Report) Aim 1. Determine the structure of an opioid receptor in complex with Gi. Aim 2. Determine the structure of the ÂµOR bound to a G protein biased agonist. Aim 3. Determine the structure of an opioid receptor in complex with arrestin. Aim 4 . Characterize the effect of different ligands on ÂµOR structure and dynamics. Resource Sharing Plan: We will share all materials generated during the course of our studies. These will be distributed freely before or immediately after publication, and we will provide relevant protocols and published data upon request. Material transfers will be made with no more restrictive terms than in the Simple Letter Agreement (SLA) or the Uniform Biological Materials Transfer Agreement (UBMTA) and without reach through requirements. We will adhere to the NIH Grant Policy on Sharing of Unique Research Resources including the Sharing of Biomedical Research Resources Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Grants and Contracts issued in December, 1999 (http://www.ott.nih.gov/policy/rt_guide_final.html?.

       " 'PROGRAM SUMMARY Mechanical ventilation, a life-saving intervention in critically ill patients with respiratory failure due to acute res- piratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also creates excessive mechanical stress that augments lung injury, a syndrome known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The pathobiology of VILI and ARDS share many in- flammatory features including increases in lung vascular permeability due to loss of endothelial cell (EC) barri- er integrity. Insights into VILI pathobiology have been incremental with no viable therapies realized. This PPG intensely focuses on increasing our understanding of: i) the transcription factors that relay the effects of exces- sive mechanical stress; ii) the molecular signaling pathways that lead to EC injury, including initial activation of a mechanosensitive Ca2+-regulatory receptor, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4); iii) post translational modifications (PTMs) that influence key signaling pathways involved in VILI re- sponses; iv) genetic and epigenetic influences in key target genes involved in VILI responses; and v) novel therapeutic strategies for VILI. The key novel genes that comprise the focus of each Project were identified by our genomic?intensive approaches and selected for their capacity to contribute to a spectrum of VILI respons- es from VILI-induced lung inflammation, increased vascular permeability and injury (Projects #1 and #2); to VILI resolution with restoration of lung vascular barrier integrity (Project #3). These strategies are integrated across our three PPG projects and represent the thematic underpinnings of this PPG. Studies will be conduct- ed by an outstanding group of gifted and interactive translational scientists. Project #1 will examine the NF-?B- dependent mechanisms (including protein nitration) by which VILI downregulates expression of SOX18, a criti- cal lung vascular barrier-protective transcription factor (TF), and the key tight junction protein, claudin 5. The influence of the mechanosensitive receptor, TRPV4 on mitochondrial ROS and mechanical stress-associated TFs such as HIF2? will be explored. Project #2 will extend novel insights regarding the critical role of secreted extracellular NAMPT (eNAMPT), a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, in VILI and ARDS. Excessive me- chanical stress induces NAMPT expression and eNAMPT ligates TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) to induce NF-?B signaling and inflammatory lung injury. Project #2 will interrogate novel mechanisms of NAMPT secretion, the influence of NAMPT/TLR4 SNPs, and NAMPT and TLR4 as therapeutic targets. Project #3 will interrogate ge- netic and epigenetic regulation of mechanical stress-mediated sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor expression (S1PR1, S1PR3) and the role of VILI-induced nitration of Rac1 and RhoA GTPases in lung vascular barrier regulation. The synergy derived from the interaction between individual Projects, as well as with our scientific Cores, with enviable expertise in molecular biology (B), genetic epidemiology (B), pre-clinical models of dis- ease (C), and protein chemistry & Biophyics (D), will advance our programmatic approaches and promote the development of novel, individualized therapies to attenuate VILI especially in populations at risk for ARDS.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The gender gap in alcohol use and problem drinking is closing. The development of effective prevention programs for young women requires an in-depth understanding of the environmental conditions that protect against or elevate liability to risky drinking and the differences between racial/ethnic groups in the relative influences of those factors. This secondary data analysis project builds on the documented differences between African-American (AA) and White young women in the prevalence of alcohol use, alcohol use disorders (AUDs), and risk factors associated with AUDs to examine possible distinctions in transitions through drinking course, with the goal of refining models of alcohol use and misuse in AA girls and young women. The underrepresentation of AA females in large-scale alcohol studies has made investigations of the fine-grain alcohol phenotypes that capture the dynamic nature of alcohol use (e.g., rate of progression from first drink to problem drinking) very challenging. The proposed early stage investigator R01 addresses this gap in alcohol research by analyzing data from three large-scale studies of alcohol use and related psychopathology in young AA and White women (twin, high-risk family and urban adolescent/young adult samples, total n=6,705, 33% AA), each of which collected detailed alcohol use history and information on psychiatric and psychosocial conditions in multiple waves of data collection. The project focuses in particular on the role of two early environmental factors that differ by race: childhood trauma, a potent risk factor for a range of psychiatric conditions, and parental monitoring, an important target of study because of its modifiability. The timing of marijuana use initiation is also examined as a possible modifier of drinking course because of the elevated prevalence of use and initiation of use before alcohol in AA young women. The proposed project is designed to (1) identify distinctions between AA and White young women in the timing of transitions between stages of alcohol use and of initiation of alcohol relative to marijuana use; (2) examine differences by race in factors that contribute to early trauma and parental monitoring as well as the subsequent influence of these early environmental factors on alcohol outcomes; and (3) explore sources of variability in the contribution of early trauma and parental monitoring to the progression of alcohol use (e.g., interaction of early trauma with genetic liability to AUDs). Findings will lead to improvements in assessment of risk and protective factors for early and problem drinking in AA and White young women and guide culturally appropriate prevention efforts.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of skeletal muscle fibers, which is a prerequisite for all bodily movement as well as for respiration, is initiated by electrical depolarization of the transverse tubules (TTs), causing membrane voltage (V) sensors in the TT dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) to trigger Ca2+ release via the abutting skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1)/Ca2+ release channels in the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. However, the molecular mechanisms coupling the TT V sensor to SR RyR1 release activation are poorly understood, and the roles of various modulatory molecules, including S100A1 and calmodulin (CaM) are not clear. These issues are important since any pathologic interference with the Ca2+ release activation process may modify or disrupt muscle function. Here in Aim 1 we identify a previously totally unsuspected marked suppression of muscle Ca2+ release in a transgenic mouse model expressing a hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) CaV1.1 V sensor charge mutation, and characterize the mechanism(s) underlying this defect in muscle activation. Muscle Ca2+ release is also modulated by a variety of accessory proteins. During the current grant cycle we have made the novel finding that the Ca2+ binding protein S100A1 binds to the previously identified calmodulin (CaM) binding domain (CaMBD) in RyR1, which should now be referred to as a CaM/S100A1 binding domain since these molecules interact for binding at this site. In Aims 2 and 3 we utilize shRNA techniques to suppress the protein expression of S100A1, CaM or both S100A1 and CaM to investigate the effects of each of these ligands as well as their competitive interaction at sites other than the CaMBD of RyR1. We will use high speed (<50 us/line) line-scan confocal imaging of fibers containing the Ca2+ indicator fluo-4 to monitor Ca2+ signals and calculate the underlying Ca2+ release flux from the SR during single or trains of action potentials in intact fibers, or during voltage clamp depolarization of whole cell voltage clamped fibers with high levels of EGTA in the patch pipette solution. We will use adult muscle fibers with molecular biologically manipulated expression of endogenous or exogenous proteins. Parallel NMR and binding studies will examine the structures and binding affinities of S100A1 and/or CaM binding to peptides corresponding to the identified binding sites. This project will elucidate basic molecular mechanisms regulating Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle and the roles of voltage sensor charges that are mutated in hypoPP in muscle Ca2+ release. It will characterize the modulation of SR Ca2+ release by S100A1 and CaM, which might be compromised in generalized or specific muscle disease states, or in aging muscle. Thus, this project has high impact for multiple disciplines, and for problems of both locomotion and breathing common to a variety of advanced diseased states and aging.',\n",
       " 'Abstract This proposal will integrate novel cell signaling models of myocyte hypertrophy into organ-level continuum models of ventricular growth, remodeling and mechanoenergetics coupled to hemodynamic models of systemic hypertension. The multi-scale computational models, together with experiments in rats subjected to ventricular hemodynamic overload, will be used to investigate the interactions between anisotropic stretch and neurohormonal signaling pathways in the development of eccentric ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis and hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling. Specifically, we will use genome-scale data from pressure-overloaded rat hearts to refine and validate quantitative models of hypertrophic regulatory networks. We will use proteomic and transcriptomic measurements from aortic-banded and sham-operated rat hearts to test and refine quantitative systems models of anisotropic stretch- and neurohormonally- simulated cardiac myocyte hypertrophy in vivo. We will also model and validate tissue- and organ-scale growth and remodeling of the heart due to ventricular pressure overload. We will couple cardiovascular system-models of whole body hemodynamics to three-dimensional continuum models of ventricular growth and remodeling driven by hypertrophic signaling models and cell-scale growth laws. Large-scale data sets from high-field diffusion-tensor magnet resonance imaging in the rat, and constrained mixture models, add detailed information on fiber architecture and material properties. Finally, we will predict mechanoenergetic consequences of ventricular hypertrophy. Models will be extended to include remodeling of contractility and energy metabolism pathways, and used to predict alterations in myocardial mechanoenergetics during pressure overload. These model predictions will then be validated with extensive characterization of in-vivo mechanics (by tagged magnetic resonance imaging) and energetics. These new models will be validated and optimized to help define and analyze specific hypertrophic pathways relevant to translational outcomes in hypertensive patients, with the ultimate potential of identifying new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for hypertensive heart disease.',\n",
       " 'Summary T lymphocytes use the T cell receptor (TCR) to recognize antigens in the form of peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). CD8 is a co-receptor that binds unliganded MHC with low affinity but TCR-liganded pMHC with 2-logs higher affinity. Some pMHCs behave as null pMHCs by themselves but as coagonist pMHCs when co-presented with agonist pMHCs by greatly enhancing TCR responses. While both phenomena have been reported, their mechanisms remain elusive due to the lack of tools to analyze multimeric interactions among multiple receptor-ligand species quantitatively. We propose to design and construct multi-DNA force probes to quantitatively study force generation and sensing by T cells. In particular, we will study how T cells exert differential forces via the TCR and CD8 on dual species of pMHCs that are clustered on the APC surface to promote multivalent binding. Using our expertise in DNA nanotechnology, we will create various DNA origami based tension probes that will report the TCR- and CD8-pMHC binding events in a quantitative fashion. The proposed experiments will be carried out in the following specific aims. (1) To develop multi-color DNA force probes for studying the cooperative effect of coagonist pMHC on agonist pMHC binding to TCR and CD8. Dual color DNA-force probes will be designed to report the binding of agonist and coagonist independently. Two sets of experiments will be performed using wild-type MHC that allows CD8 binding and/or mutant MHC that prevents CD8 binding to present agonist and/or coagonist peptides in different combinations. Our study will provide insights to how coagonist binding to CD8 affects agonist binding in terms of force generation and sensing by the T cell. (2) To develop DNA force probe arrays with controlled coagonist/agonist spatial organization for investigating the multivalent binding between TCR/CD8 and agonist/coagonist. We will create complex arrays of dual color probes to simulate the clustering effect. Origami- based DNA nanostructures with various inter-probe distances, ratios and densities will be used to investigate the clustering effect. Our study will shed light on the mechanism of T cell mechanosensing. T cell functions are governed by coordinated interactions of many receptors, including antigen receptor/coreceptor, adhesion receptors, cytokine receptors, and co-stimulatory/inhibitory receptors. The tools developed herein are applicable to study of other molecular interactions of T cells and other cells in the immune system or other biological systems, thereby potentially impacting the broader biomedicine field where cell surface molecular interactions are being targeted for treatment of various diseases, including autoimmunity, viral infection, and cancer. !',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Many steps of cancer drug development involves the use of standard cancer cell lines (SCCL) which have been instrumental in the development of many targeted therapies; including Herceptin, Gleevac and Tamoxifen among others. However, establishing new CCL that mimic human disease is still challenging due to in vitro clonal selection and loss of the original tumor phenotype. In addition, the efficiency of creating new cell lines is very low. As a result, ~90% of ovarian and breast cancer research has been carried out in 5 CCL each 1, 2. These SCCL and leukemia cell lines do not fully represent the real-life diversity of human disease3-5. Innovation: One of the persistent shortcomings of cell culture technology is the use of full serum, drugs and feeder layers that are partly responsible for the poor replication of the original tumor phenotype. In order to address these problems we developed a series of serum-free tissue specific culture (TSC) media that increases the efficiency of establishing new cell lines to > 50% and retains important tissue specific original tumor features. Preliminary data: We recently published the first application of the TSC technology for ovarian cancer (OvCa), describing 25 new OvCa cell lines that retain molecular, histologic and outcome features of the patient tumors6. Objectives: Our long-term goal is to develop novel TSC media and methods to expand our technology to all tumor types and improve the methods to solve the stromal and normal cell overgrowth problem. Specific Aims: While we work on all tumor types, in this grant we focus on solid tumors (Breast, Ovary) and a liquid tumor (Leukemia) to illustrate that our system can be adapted to culture the full spectrum of tumor types. Aim 1) Characterization of new breast cancer cell lines: We formulated a new normal breast specific and breast cancer specific media, which we will use to establish matching normal and cancer cell lines. Aim 2) Characterization of new acute myeloid leukemia (AML) lines: We formulated a new serum-free medium customized for AML, which we will use to establish new AML cell lines. Aim 3) Culture of sub-optimal samples: Tissue samples with <10% tumor are difficult to culture due to stromal over-growth. We developed a method that suppress stroma to enable culture of sub-optimal tissue samples. Validation of Cancer-Relevant Biospecimen Science Technology: The genome, transcriptome and proteome of each cell line will be compared to the original patient tumor, existing cell lines and tumor datasets. Substantial Improvement and New Capabilities. Our TSC system can maintain cell lines without feeder layers, drugs, extracts, and suppresses the over-growth of stromal and normal cells. Transformative Potential. The biological relevance of SCCL is highly questionable. Hence, it is not surprising that drugs that are developed using SCCL frequently fail in the clinic. Our ability to provide biologically relevant BrCa, OvCa, and AML cell lines can have a transformative effect on cancer drug development.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Small Animal Radiation Research (SARR) is of paramount importance for the advancement of human radiotherapy (RT) by serving as a critical counterpart to perform comprehensive preclinical studies on a large number of subjects under controlled experimental conditions at low costs. SARR relies on dedicated platforms to administer radiation dose to animals in a similar way as in the clinic. Current-generation SARR irradiators, developed in the past decade, have failed to keep pace with technology advancements in human RT. In stark contrast to modern RT treatments where novel anatomical and functional imaging, inverse treatment planning, and intensity modulated delivery techniques are routinely employed to precisely form an extremely conformal dose distribution to the tumor, the therapeutic form in current SARR systems resembles an obsolete form of human RT. This technology disparity has substantially impaired SARR study relevance to human RT, impeded explorations in RT research, and hindered rapid conduction of SARR studies. Towards addressing this problem, in response to PAR-15-075, this project will develop and translate a next-generation SARR platform through an academic-industrial partnership, joining medical physicists and radiobiologists at UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) with engineering experts at Faxitron Bioptics LLC (Faxitron). The developed system will be substantially superior to the current state-of-the-art SARR platform due to its novel imaging methods (dual energy cone beam CT and PET), intensity modulated radiotherapy, and high computation and treatment delivery efficiency. These novel features are expected to improve SARR research relevance to human RT by delivering treatments of clinical quality, to support exploration in modern RT by offering technical freedom to realize novel imaging and therapy approaches, and to increase research efficiency by enhancing computational speed and workflow. We will perform studies with the following specific aims (SAs): SA1: Refine hardware design and construct the hardware system including mechanical, imaging, and therapy subsystems. SA2: Refine software design and develop an imaging and treatment planning system accompanied with the hardware platform. SA3: Perform comprehensive system tests, develop a translation plan, and demonstrate achieved advantages of the system via an animal study on image-guided intensity-modulated lung stereotactic body radiotherapy using rats. The innovation of this project includes novel technological capabilities enabled by the next-generation SARR platform, as well as coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end- users. Project feasibility is ensured by extensive preliminary studies, and the research team integrating medical physicists and radiobiologists (UTSW) with strong clinical and research expertise and engineers (Faxitron) with extensive commercial product development experience. By filling the critical void between SARR and human RT, the developed system will become an essential component in preclinical research for the exploration of novel radiotherapeutic strategies with high relevance to human RT.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lindsay Caverly, MD is a pediatric pulmonologist and scientist at the University of Michigan. This K23 proposal will complete Dr. Caverly's training towards her long-term career goal of improving the health of children with lung diseases through a better understanding of the lung microbial ecology. This proposal will build on Dr. Caverly's previously acquired expertise in pulmonary pathophysiology and nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection to provide her with new expertise in clinical research methodology and computational biology. In the proposed project, she will integrate her established and newly-acquired skills to elucidate the role of airway microbiota in the pathogenesis of NTM infection in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). This research and training will be guided by her primary mentor, John J. LiPuma MD, co-mentor Patrick D. Schloss PhD, and an advisory board of accomplished senior scientists with expertise in clinical research methods, computational biology, microbial ecology, and biostatistics, and success in mentoring junior physician-scientists. Dr. Caverly's three year plan includes formal coursework to obtain a Master's Degree in Bioinformatics, professional development activities, and progressively independent research. Although NTM pulmonary infections cause significant morbidity and mortality for individuals with CF, the determinants of NTM pulmonary disease, including risk factors for NTM infection and variables impacting disease progression, are largely unknown. The increasing appreciation that CF airways harbor complex microbial communities provides an opportunity to investigate the role of airway microbiota in the pathogenesis of NTM disease. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that changes in the structure and metabolic activities of CF airway microbiota precede and predict NTM infection, while Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that features of the structure and metabolic activities CF airway microbiota predict clinical course after NTM infection. To complete these aims, Dr. Caverly will capitalize on an existing repository of CF sputum samples and linked clinical data. She will also execute a prospective, observational study of individuals with CF to complement the existing samples, gain expertise in clinical research methods, and build a repository of CF sputum samples and clinical data for future studies. Dr. Caverly will use state-of-the art DNA sequencing and metabolomics platforms to characterize the structure and metabolic activities of CF airway microbiota, and will integrate the microbial and clinical data using novel analytic techniques of computational biology to build predictive models of patient-relevant outcomes. Dr. Caverly anticipates that these results will have an important positive impact in informing risk prediction for NTM infection, guiding clinical decision making, and illuminating novel biology. This K23 award will establish a foundation for a programmatic line of research to understand the role of airway microbiota in CF and NTM infection, and will equip Dr. Caverly with the skills to be a leader in the field of patient-oriented pediatric pulmonary research.\",\n",
       " 'Sarcomere gene mutations cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a common devastating disease. HCM is characterized by cardiac/myocyte hypertrophy, myocyte disarray, fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmias and risk of sudden cardiac death. While HCM may progress to heart failure, sudden death can occur before heart failure develops. While an enormous amount of knowledge of genetics and molecular mechanisms of cardiomyocyte dysfunction has been gained from animal models of HCM, very little is known regarding the roles of cardiac innervation and its interactions with the cardiac renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in HCM. We hypothesize that pathological remodeling of the heart, and cardiomyocyte energy depletion in HCM induces dysregulation of cardiac sensory nerve activity leading to cardiac sympathovagal imbalance, activation of cardiac RAS, and decreased baroreflex sensitivity, all of which promote arrhythmias and accelerate progression to congestive heart failure and death. We will utilize two established mouse models of HCM with cardiac-targeted human mutations and differing phenotypes to test our hypothesis. Specific Aims of the project are to: (1) Determine roles of cardiac vagal and ?sympathetic? afferent nerves, and arterial baroreflex in mediating autonomic and cardiac dysfunction in HCM mice, and (2) Test the hypothesis that chronic infusion of the angiotensin peptide Ang-(1-7) to HCM mice will inhibit cardiac sympathetic tone and oppose deleterious actions of angiotensin II, resulting in less cardiac fibrosis and improved left ventricular (LV) function. Experimental approaches include telemetric monitoring of blood pressure, assessment of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, and baroreflex sensitivity; assessment of cardiac function by echocardiograph, and LV pressure recordings; and chemical ablation of cardiac ?sympathetic? afferent neurons. Additionally, the angiotensin peptide Ang-(1-7) will be infused chronically to inhibit the cardiac RAS and sympathetic nerve activity for therapeutic benefit. The significance of this research relates to understanding the key roles played by cardiac sensory and sympathetic nerves, baroreflexes, and cardiac RAS in determining the severity of HCM and its progression to heart failure. In addition, a novel treatment [Ang-(1-7) infusion] for HCM will be tested with potential clinical implications.',\n",
       " 'SUMMARY     In ecosystem modeling, the Allee effect describes a correlation between population size (number of members)  and mean fitness (proliferation rate) of individuals. Increased proliferation with increased population size  implies cooperative interactions.  A contrasting principle in ecosystems is population ?carrying capacity? which  describes a decrease in growth rates with increasing population size, due to competition for limited resources.   While the concept of carrying capacity has been studied in tumors (which may become limited in nutrients or  oxygen), the Allee effect has been almost entirely overlooked. Allee effects are significant in small populations  and thus may be critical to understanding the earliest steps in tumor iniation.  To investigate the fundamental  contribution of the Allee effect on tumor ecosystems requires the novel experimental designs and integration of  quantitative experimental measurements with mathematical modeling. The overall goal of this project is to  dissect the contribution of population size and cell cell communication in a few selected, well suited tumor cell  lines through quantitative single cell resolution, real time monitoring of cell populations. Mathematical models  of growth kinetics will show that the Allee effect and cell cell communication has consequences on a single  cancer cell?s decision to initiate a growing tumor or to stay dormant.  These communication networks will be  further mapped by identification of specific paracrine factors and receptors. Disruption of the communication  network that establishes a proliferative tumor will be performed by targeting specific cell subpopulation  interactions. Perturbations will include depletion of specific cell subtypes, manipulation of overall paracrine  signaling, and blocking of specific ligand receptor combinations on interacting species. These strategies may  be novel tools to trigger tumor cell population collapse. Population level effects in a nascent tumor population  have not been quantitatively explored and may explain the phenomenon of critical thresholds and define a  mechanistic role for intratumor heterogeneity. This project focuses on a fundamental generic principle that is  broadly applicable in many contexts and thus could complement and enrich the modeling efforts of the cancer  research community.

       " 'Despite the discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) over 100 years ago and the availability of effective drugs for over 60 years, there remain formidable hurdles for controlling tuberculosis (TB) disease including the lack of a highly efficacious vaccine, long drug treatment regimens, prevention of infection, and killing dormant bacilli within macrophages. After close contact with a person with pulmonary TB, most people develop latent Mtb infection (LTBI). However, some individuals are naturally resistant to infection (RSTRs). The mechanisms of resistance are unknown and may provide insight into novel therapeutic strategies. In a large TB household contact study in urban Uganda over the past 20 years, we found that ~9% of close adult household contacts remained persistently TST and Interferon-? Release Assay (IGRA) negative during extended follow-up. To our knowledge, this large Ugandan cohort is unique with rigorous longitudinal clinical and epidemiologic data. Using genome-wide profiling of mRNA isolated from Mtb-infected peripheral blood- derived monocytes, we compared transcriptional signatures in the RSTR and LTBI groups. We found that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) gene family distinguishes RSTRs from LTBIs and may regulate resistance to Mtb infection. HDACs regulate transcription and some family members mediate the innate immune response to microbes. We also found polymorphisms in HDAC1 that are associated with resistance to infection. In peripheral blood monocyte-derived and alveolar macrophages, HDAC inhibitor treatment decreased Mtb replication in comparison to untreated cells. These findings support the concept that RSTRs have protective innate immune responses that are monocyte-dependent. However, several critical questions need to be addressed including elucidation of the molecular and genetic mechanisms of HDAC-mediated control of Mtb replication in macrophages and clinical resistance to Mtb infection. In addition, the role of alveolar macrophages in regulating HDAC-mediated immune responses is poorly understood. We hypothesize that HDACs mediate resistance to infection by inhibiting Mtb replication through transcriptional regulation of anti- microbial pathways. Characterization of HDAC-dependent immune responses will enable identification of natural resistance mechanisms to Mtb infection. The latter will provide new insight into our understanding of TB pathogenesis, point to novel approaches to TB vaccine and drug development, and identify biomarkers of resistance to and/or clearance of Mtb infection. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is a major human pathogen responsible for extensive mortality and billions of dollars in health care costs. Pa infections are particularly devastating in Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a disease associated with defective ion transport, tenacious airway secretions, and chronic lung infections. Pa is particularly pathogenic in CF because of its ability to form robust biofilms - slimy conglomerates of polymers that allow Pa to colonize airways and to evade antibiotics.  We recently identified Pf bacteriophages (phages) as a virulence factor that Pa uses to build biofilms. Pf phages are long, filamentous viruses produced by Pa that spontaneously organize extracellular matrix into a liquid crystal. This assembly is driven by entropic, charge-based interactions between Pf phages and host and microbial polymers. The resulting crystalline architecture fortifies biofilms, making them more viscous, adherent, and tolerant to antibiotics. We recently reported that many CF patients have crystalline sputum.  Because Pf phage-mediated polymer crystallization is highly concentration-dependent, sputum Pf phage titers in CF patients may have clinical significance. However, the prevalence and clinical impact of Pf phages in CF patients are unknown.  Along with enhancing the pathogenic features of established Pa biofilms, Pf phage may also promote the initial establishment of Pa infections. Pa dramatically increase Pf phage production without hours of intra-tracheal instillation in a mouse model of acute lung infection. Our preliminary data indicate that mice in this model clear Pa strains lacking Pf phage while Pf phage-competent strains reliably establish infections. In light of these contributions to the pathogenesis of Pa lung infections, we propose that Pa may partner symbiotically with Pf phage to promote Pa lung infections.  It may be advantageous to target Pf phage therapeutically. To this end, we have developed anti-Pf phage vaccines and monoclonal antibodies that target Pf phage and disrupt crystallization. Our data suggest that active or passive immunization against Pf phage may be an effective strategy for preventing Pa infection.  In light of these exciting preliminary data, we propose to test the hypothesis that Pf phages are critical virulence factors that can be targeted to prevent chronic Pa infections. To test this, In Aim 1 we will characterize how Pf phages impact clinical outcomes in CF. In Aim 2 we will define how anti-Pf phage antibody levels influence clinical outcomes in CF. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine whether anti-Pf phage vaccines and monoclonal antibodies prevent the establishment of Pa infections in animal models.  Together, these aims represent a bold, imaginative, and radically unconventional approach to Pa biofilm Infections. If successful, this work will provide the clinical rationale and mechanistic foundation needed to support R01-level investigations into the efficacy of anti-Pf phage immunization in CF and other settings.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming, obligately anaerobic, toxigenic bacterium that is the leading cause of hospital acquired antibiotic-associated diarrhea worldwide. Along with two other antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria, the CDC classifies C. difficile as an immediate public health threat that requires urgent and aggressive action. Accumulating evidence indicates that during infection C. difficile modifies its energy metabolism in response to changing nutrient conditions in the gut. Our results show that C. difficile possesses substantially greater metabolic versatility than previously appreciated, and is capable of rapidly shifting its metabolism to grow in the absence of several amino acids that until now were considered to be essential. Efficient growth on glucose in the absence of all major Stickland acceptor amino acids implicates an ability of C. difficile to readily adapt to a changing nutrient landscape in the infected host gut. Our studies further show that the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, an energy-generating system in acetogens and certain other anaerobic bacteria and archaea, is dramatically up-regulated in response to the shift to growth on carbohydrates -- a nutrient source that host-derived glycans may provide under conditions of limited amino acid availability. Under these conditions, the central enzymes in the pathway, AcsB and CO dehydrogenase, attain physiologically relevant levels not previously observed in C. difficile. Our hypothesis is that the Wood- Ljungdahl pathway allows C. difficile to effectively adjust its energy metabolism and possible biosynthetic requirements in response to changing nutrient conditions in the gut. To test this hypothesis our specific aim is to carry out a detailed characterization of the properties of a C. difficile 630 acsB deletion mutant. The effects on growth, metabolite profiles, qRT-PCR analysis of various transcripts, phenotypic microarrays, the ability to produce toxin and effectively sporulate will be compared with the wild type under various growth-supportive nutrient conditions to provide a comprehensive characterization of the mutant. The results will elucidate how the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway is integrated in the metabolism of C. difficile, and define how the pathway acts to confer a metabolic advantage to this pathogen. The findings will direct future studies to evaluate the pathway as a potential target for prevention or treatment of C. difficile infection.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito borne flavivirus that recently emerged in the Americas. ZIKV infection is associated with severe disease outcomes, including Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and microcephaly, a devastating congenital disorder where fetal brain development is impaired. Despite ZIKV?s status as a significant emerging disease threat, there are currently no approved vaccines or therapies for ZIKV infection. Thus a better understanding of ZIKV replication is needed to guide both vaccine and therapy design. While relatively little is known about ZIKV virulence determinants, a growing body of evidence suggests that RNA structural elements in RNA viral genomes play a major role in virus replication and pathogenesis. The full complement of RNA secondary structures within the ZIKV genome is not known, nor is it understood how these structures affect replication. We therefore used selective 2?-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP) to define the RNA structural landscape of the entire ZIKV genome of a clinical isolate from the ongoing ZIKV epidemic in the Americas. This analysis provided the first comprehensive view of RNA structure in the ZIKV genome. We identified RNA secondary structures distributed throughout the genome, including 19 regions with exceptionally high structural stability. These highly stable structures include known structures within the ZIKV 5? UTR and 3? UTR, thus validating the use of SHAPE-MAP to identify ZIKV RNA structures. The additional highly stable RNA structures are present across the coding region of the ZIKV genome and have not been characterized. These results demonstrate that the ZIKV genome is highly structured, and we hypothesize that the novel RNA structures may play important roles in multiple aspects of the ZIKV lifecycle. The fact that known flavivirus RNA structures are highly conserved suggests that some of the novel ZIKV structures are also conserved across flaviruses and may function as virulence determinants. Therefore, in Aim 1 we test whether novel, highly stable RNA structures in the ZIKV genome are important for ZIKV replication and pathogenesis. To determine the level of RNA structural conservation between ZIKV and other flaviviruses, in Aim 2 we use SHAPE-MaP to comprehensively define RNA structure in the entire genome of several other medically important flaviviruses (Yellow Fever virus, West Nile virus, and Powassan virus). These studies will significantly advance our understanding of how RNA structure impacts ZIKV biology, and provide new insights into whether highly conserved RNA structures broadly contribute to flavivirus replication and pathogenesis.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY There are inherent physical uncertainties with particle therapy (i.e. beam range uncertainty) which have become major factors leading to large margins, thereby unnecessarily exposing additional dose to normal tissues, and forcing clinicians taking overly conservative treatment plans to restrict the dose to tumor or avoiding advantageous beam angles to ensure sparing of critical organs at risk. It is critically important to overcome this impediment in order to dramatically enhance particle therapy outcomes and achieve its full clinical benefits. The goal of this research project is to develop an innovative PET image-based on-line verification of proton therapy for brain cancer treatment instead of the current off-line method in order to directly measure the potential deviation of actual proton beam range from that predicted by the treatment plan before the start of treatment. In this project, we challenge the conventional belief and propose a unique approach of using part of the therapy beams for imaging, thus overcoming the long-standing technical obstacle for achieving the on-line PET imaging method. We will pursue three specific aims to achieve the goal of this project: 1) Develop and evaluate a brain PET capable for desired on-line imaging; 2) Develop and evaluate algorithms and software that will select probing beams for range measurement and enable range-shift compensated beam delivery; 3) Establish and improve the on-line PET based range measurement and adaptive particle therapy. The success of this project will fill a critical technical gap and make the on-line PET based range measurement and adaptive particle therapy clinically practical for the first time. It could shift clinical study with a new image-based particle therapy paradigm, which will significantly improve the particle beam targeting, enable new and better treatment plan, and improve the therapy efficacy and patient care. The outcome of this project will also pave the way to develop similar technology for whole-body on-line PET imaging and adaptive particle therapy applications.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Heart transplantation is a vital therapy for end-stage heart failure. The effectiveness of this therapy, however, is largely limited by the shortage of donors. Regrettably, less than 40% of available heart donations are used for transplantation and the rate of use is declining due to increasing donor age. Transplants from donors older than 55 years of age are typically disregarded as increasing donor age is the strongest independent factor for both mortality and the development of chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV), the leading cause of graft loss for organ transplants. Additionally, older donor hearts often exhibit atherosclerosis, rendering them unsuitable for transplantation. However, the mechanisms by which donor age increases CAV remain unknown. Our prior work demonstrates that aged murine vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) contribute to vascular inflammation by producing IL-6, CCL2 and osteopontin via MyD88, an innate immune adaptor protein downstream of the Toll like receptors. Our preliminary data also indicate that aging impairs mitophagy, i.e., the clearance of damaged mitochondria, within VSMC to enhance vascular inflammation. We therefore hypothesize that impaired mitophagy within aged donor VSMC leads to MyD88-dependent vascular inflammation that enhances CAV. To test this hypothesis, we will use novel mice in which MyD88 is selectively deleted within VSMC to examine whether MyD88 expression within VSMC of the aged donor vasculature is critical for CAV in a murine heart transplant model (Aim 1). We will also examine whether MyD88 expression within VSMC of the aged donor vasculature is critical for the progression of pre-existing donor atherosclerosis after cardiac transplantation by employing a novel method to induce atherosclerosis in the donor heart prior to transplantation. In addition, we will use young mice in which either autophagy or mitophagy is disabled within VSMC, to determine if autophagy or mitophagy in these cells controls CAV (Aim 2). We will complement this approach by examining if administration of agents that enhance autophagy, e.g., rapamycin or mitophagy e.g., actinonin, to aged donor mice reduces CAV after cardiac transplantation. We expect that our study will directly link inflammatory pathways in the donor vasculature to CAV. Our results could lead to new therapeutics to reduce both the development of CAV and the progression of native vessel atherosclerosis in donor hearts. Such therapeutics could tremendously increase the pool of heart transplant donors and save lives of patients with end stage heart failure.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most prevalent birth defects, affecting up to 1% of live births. While a genetic etiology is indicated by the finding of various syndromic forms of CHD, the genetic causes of CHD is still not well understood. As the genetic variability of the human population confounds human genetic analysis, we recently pursued a large scale ethylnitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen in inbred C57BL6 mice to recover recessive mutations causing CHD. Phenotyping was conducted using noninvasive fetal echocardiography, an imaging modality used clinically for CHD diagnosis. From ultrasound scanning 100,000 fetuses, we recovered >250 CHD mutant mouse lines with a wide spectrum of CHD. We recovered 150 CHD causing mutations in 94 genes using whole exome sequencing analysis. Surprisingly, 50% of the CHD genes are cilia related, indicating a central role for cilia in CHD pathogenesis. Also unexpected was the recovery of many cilia related CHD genes encoding proteins known to physically interact, suggesting the hypothesis that CHD pathogenesis may occur via epistasis in the context of a CHD interactome network. This could contribute to the complex genetics associated with human CHD. To test this hypothesis, we plan to conduct a novel sensitized screen for the first systematic interrogation of the mouse genome for semi-dominant CHD mutations. The screen will be conducted using a driver mutation in Cep290, a cilia-CHD gene recovered in our recessive screen that is also clinically well described to exert genetic modifier effects, both in various human ciliopathies and in mutant mouse models. Our screen will entail ultrasound scanning G2 fetuses for CHD derived from females heterozygous for the Cep290 mutation mated to a G1 male heterozygous for ENU induced mutations. The resulting G2 offspring can only be double heterozygous for the Cep290 and ENU induced mutations (except when the ENU mutation is also in Cep290). Thus any CHD observed would reflect the effects of epistasis. Using this strategy, we expect to screen ~54,000 fetuses from 1800 G1 pedigrees, providing a systems approach to interrogate the role of cilia in the complex genetics of CHD not possible with a recessive screen. Mutation recovery will be carried out using whole mouse exome sequencing followed by genotyping analysis, and further linkage analysis conducted within and across multiple pedigrees. For validation of causal mutations identified in the screen, transgenic mouse models will be generated using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, followed by intercrosses with the Cep290 mutation to examine for evidence of epistasis. Overall, this novel sensitized screen will provide the first systematic interrogation of the mouse genome for semi-dominant mutations causing CHD. By using mutation in Cep290 as driver for this sensitized screen, we can further elucidate role of cilia in CHD pathogenesis. The mutations and animal models recovered in this sensitized screen will better model the complex genetics of human CHD and better inform future clinical studies interrogating the genetics etiology of CHD in the human population.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract There is substantial interest in using biologics to reduce body and joint pain and to accelerate healing from orthopaedic injuries and surgery1,2. Musculoskeletal problems attributed to injuries and aging are the leading cause of disability in the United States3. In recent years, there has been an exponential rise in the use of biologics to treat orthopaedic problems. This rise is primarily due to widespread use of ?minimally manipulated? autologous therapies such as platelet rich plasma (PRP), that are not required to undergo pre-market approval/clearance from the Food and Drug Administration1. Consequently, clinical use of these treatments has greatly outpaced evidence based research. Concerns over misinformation and patient safety have led to recent calls to action, including one from the American Association for the Advancement of Science5. The orthopaedic professional societies and research communities share these concerns. To address these concerns, Optimizing Clinical Use of Biologics in Orthopaedic Surgery Research Symposium will be a collaborative and interactive meeting to develop a collective impact agenda to promote informed regulation and funding of new pathways for the clinical evaluation of biologics. Specifically, the symposium aims to determine candidate biologic targets for common orthopaedic conditions and injuries, identify a process to determine what is known about the composition and biologic activity of biologics using PRP as a model, determine the feasibility of establishing a clinical registry to collect data on the use of biologics, and identify regulatory pathways to facilitate their use. Symposium faculty and participants will consider clinical trial designs to include use of adaptive clinical trials to test the efficacy of PRP. A combination of didactic talks presented by subject matter experts followed by small group discussions modeled after the NIH/NIAMS Roundtable format will be used to achieve the aims. Symposium participants will be comprised of orthopaedic physicians, the scientific community including NIH and FDA, and young investigators whose research focuses on biologics. The general sessions of the symposium will be open to registrants. The resultant consensus documents, including draft guidance on clinical assessment of biologics that can impact regulatory pathways, are of critical importance to implementing a framework for responsible and evidence based translation of new biologic treatments into clinical use to treat orthopaedic problems. These outcomes serve the public interest and have high potential to positively impact patient care and public health.',\n",
       " 'Project Abstract: Despite recent improvements in immunosuppression, graft/patient survival of small intestinal transplantation (ITx) remains suboptimal, limiting the broader application of this therapy. Induction of donor- specific tolerance to any organ is desirable to eliminate co-morbidities associated with immunosuppressive treatment. The induction of tolerance is particularly desirable for ITx due to: (1) the requirement for high levels of immunosuppression to prevent rejection of small bowel grafts; (2) complications associated with heavy immunosuppression; and (3) the young average age of the recipients. However, to our knowledge, tolerance of intestinal allografts has not been extensively studied in preclinical models. Even in rodent models, there are few reports demonstrating tolerance to small intestine, but one successful strategy has been through the induction of durable mixed allogeneic chimerism. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a large animal preclinical model for tolerance induction following ITx and to develop a protocol appropriate for tolerance induction in parent to child (living donor LD) ITx. We recently reported that rejection rates appear to be higher in clinical recipients of isolated intestinal transplants (iITx) compared to multivisceral transplants (MVTx), which include donor liver, stomach and pancreas. Notably we have found, for the first time, that T cell mixed chimerism which develops without GVHD following iITx and even more commonly following MVTx, is associated with reduced rejection rates. We hypothesize that the presence of graft-vs-host-reactive (GVHR) clones in these MVTx recipients facilitates engraftment of donor progenitor cells contained within the grafts, and further hypothesize that transplantation of additional hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during this period of the GVHR will augment chimerism and tolerance induction even in iITx recipients. The early GVHR that migrates from the graft to the recipient?s peripheral immune system (lymphohematopoietic GVH response, or LGVHR) makes hematopoietic ?space? for engraftment of these hematopoietic progenitors. In this proposal, we will utilize MHC inbred miniature swine, the only large animal model that allows reproducible transplantation with defined GVH and host-vs-graft (HvG) genetic barriers, to address the above hypotheses and develop a clinically relevant LD ITx tolerance induction model. We will first establish a porcine model of orthotopic iITx and MvTx that parallels our institution?s clinical protocol and determine the role of GVH and HvG alloreactivity in driving chimerism and clinical outcomes (Aim 1). We will then utilize the LGVHR and donor HSCs to achieve tolerance in long-term allograft acceptors in the models in Aim 1 (Aim 2). The studies in this proposal may have eventual clinical applicability that could solve the most problematic issues in ITx and vastly improve the outcomes of this therapeutic modality.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY The worldwide adoption of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) has been instrumental in halving the global burden of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria since the early 2000s. Malaria?s impact nonetheless remains vast, with over 400,000 yearly deaths in Africa alone. Now, Pf resistance to ACTs threatens to overwhelm malaria control efforts. Treatment failure rates with the ACT dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine (PPQ) currently exceed 50% in Cambodia, and resistance to other ACTs has been observed elsewhere in Asia. The emergence and spread of ACT resistance in Africa would be calamitous. Studies have identified core roles for the Pf chloroquine resistance transporter PfCRT and the multidrug resistance transporter PfMDR1 in modulating Pf susceptibility to the ACT partner drugs PPQ, amodiaquine (ADQ), pyronaridine (PND), lumefantrine (LMF) and mefloquine (MFQ). These studies include our recent gene editing-based finding that novel PfCRT mutations present in Cambodia can confer PPQ resistance. By analyzing a dataset of >2,500 Pf genomes sampled across Asia and Africa, we now find a plethora of new sequence variants of both genes. In Aim 1, we will apply gene editing techniques coupled with comprehensive drug susceptibility profiling to test the hypothesis that these novel PfCRT mutations have been selected to mediate ACT partner drug resistance. In Asia, we predict that these variants primarily affect susceptibility to PPQ, LMF, or MFQ. In Africa, we observe a predominance of previously uncharacterized haplotypes, and will characterize whether these variants mediate reduced susceptibility to partner drugs and/or minimize fitness costs. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that current ACTs are selecting for novel mutations in PfMDR1 throughout Asia and Africa. Based on our recent discovery of a role for PfMDR1 as a mediator of gametocyte resistance to antimalarials, we will also assess whether mutant PfMDR1 isoforms can enhance the transmission of drug-resistant Pf parasites. In Aim 3, we propose to identify antimalarial combinations that exert opposing selective pressures on PfCRT and PfMDR1 and thus preclude the acquisition of multidrug resistance. Using selection methods with mutant pfcrt and pfmdr1 lines, our studies will experimentally address the premise of two ongoing triple ACT clinical trials in Cambodia, which are testing the dual partner drug combinations LMF+ADQ and PPQ+MFQ as approaches to effectively treat drug-resistant malaria and prevent its further evolution and spread. In Aim 4, we will use cell- based assays to test the hypothesis that hemoglobin endocytosis and subsequent processing in the Pf digestive vacuole are key aspects of the modes of action of most ACT drugs, whose potency can be impacted by mutant isoforms of PfMDR1 or PfCRT. This proposal, which aligns with the NIAID priority of supporting research on antimicrobial drug resistance, will transform our understanding of ACT partner drug resistance and modes of action, provide new biomarkers, and identify strategies to effectively treat drug-resistant Pf malaria.',\n",
       " \"Abstract Malaria remains a great public health challenge that has resisted world-wide control efforts. The malaria parasite's intracellular life-cycle inside red blood cells (RBC) and its ability for antigenic variation have thwarted vaccine development. Immunity to malaria is short-lived and requires constant exposure to the parasite. Naturally acquired immunity is gained by residents in malaria endemic areas, which protects them from severe malaria and reduces the risk of reinfection. All adaptive arms of the immune system, namely T and B cells can contribute to clinical immunity against different stages of the parasite cycle, both in humans and in mouse models of malaria. Passive transfer of serum from clinically immune individual can protect susceptible patients, establishing the importance to antibody responses in protection. Yet, how protective antibody responses are achieved is unknown. Current vaccines against the deadliest form of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), are only partially protective and confer only limited protection over time. This proposal builds on the study of a cohort of African patients that allowed us to capture varied levels of clinical immunity. Using high throughput unsupervised analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma from clinically protected versus susceptible patients, we discovered the presence of an expanded subset of memory CD4+ T cells. Frequencies of these cells also correlated with higher plasma parasite-specific opsonizing Abs. We hypothesize that the memory CD4+ T cells are essential for long-lived immunity against malaria by promoting optimal protective Ab responses. The current proposal will explore the functional attributes of these memory CD4+ T cells and establish the characteristics of these highly protective Abs that develop in clinically protected patients.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a novel drug, R-4329, for the prevention and/or treatment of Clostridium (C.) difficile pathogenesis. R-4329 is based on a unique protein known as secreted antigen A (SagA) identified from Enterococcus faecium which our research team showed can protect against multiple enteric infections, including C. difficile, by enhancing the integrity of the gut membrane barrier1, 2. C. difficile is a ubiquitous anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium that can sporulate and become highly resistant to environment stresses and frontline antibiotics such as clindamycin3. Pathogenic strains of C. difficile secret toxins (A and B) that damage intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in inflammatory colitis, severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, flu-like symptoms, and possible death3. C. difficile infection (CDI) often occurs following antibiotic-treatment when the endogenous microflora of individuals is altered or severely reduced. Since 2000, the rate of CDI has increased from below 150,000 to over 250,000 cases and has been become one of the most significant hospital-acquired infections with an economic burden of over $1 billion to treat in the USA 3. Once C. difficile establishes residence in the colon, it is difficult to eradicate with last resort antibiotics (vancomycin) and consequently results in relapses of CDI and inflammatory colitis. An effective approach to treating CDI has been fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) therapy4. However, FMT is a heterogeneous and poorly defined therapeutic, for which its safety is still a major concern requiring special FDA approval4. New and well-defined therapeutics are desperately needed to prevent and treat CDI. Defined strains of probiotics offer an exciting alternative to prevent and treat CDI and many strains of Lactobacillus (acidophilus, casei, reuteri, plantarum) have been explored as probiotics to inhibit infection of enteric pathogens and mitigate antibiotic-associated diarrhea5. Unfortunately, the mechanism of action has been difficult to characterize with limiting beneficial effects in the context of their clinical utility6. While more clinical studies are still needed, these recent studies suggest that improved probiotics may be even more effective at controlling CDI. Indeed, our recent results published in the journal Science demonstrate that engineering or ?reprogramming? of probiotics to recombinantly express SagA yields a more protective functionality against enteric infections, including CDI2. Our goal is to develop a novel probiotic strain to deliver SagA (referred to as R-4329) as an orally administered drug that functions naturally to induce protective regulatory signals. The key objectives are to: 1) generate L. lactis clones expressing SagA from a genome- integrated operon; 2) select a R-4329 clinical candidate based on growth rate, SagA expression, and stability, and 3) demonstrate R-4329 activity in the murine C. difficile infection model. Successful commercialization of R-4329 will ultimately provide a profound front-line medical advancement in the treatment of enteric infection.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to build a cloud-based integrated solution for scalable, customizable, privacy-preserving, and interactive antibody repertoire analysis. Immune repertoire sequencing (IR-seq) has become a useful tool in both basic research and clinical settings. As the heart of the adaptive immunity to infection and many vaccines, the abundance and diversity composition of the B cell receptor (BCR) and its dynamic changes in health and diseases bear information of how to evaluate immune health, perform disease diagnosis and prognosis, and measure vaccination effect. However, there is a computational bottleneck for large scale antibody lineage construction, a lack of decomposable pipeline modules that preserve privacy and ownership, and a missing gap for interactive linage analysis and visualization. In this Phase I grant, we will (1) break the bottlenecks of pipeline processing and scale up the core algorithms to handle large sequence data sets; (2) protect private data and proprietary processing algorithms with modularized pipeline, integrated cloud-local processing, and data perturbation methods; 3) develop end-to-end web services for pipeline composition and interactive analysis visualization in a cloud-based deployment solution. Existing commercial efforts are mostly focusing on cancer related IR-seq analysis aiming to trace the disappearing of cancer cells after therapy, which solely focus on cataloging sequence species and abundance. This kind of analysis is much simpler and easier, compared to analyzing IR-seq data in infection and vaccination. Providing insights on host immune responses is a much more challenging but much needed task. Once the pipeline is built, it can be readily adapted to analyze cancer IR-seq data. Also, existing algorithms and optimizations that have been developed for other big data analysis can be further developed and applied to the IR-seq data analysis. We will use a publically available BCR repertoire data on an influenza vaccination cohort and a TCR repertoire data on an aging cohort to test the feasibility of the project. The long term goal of this proposal is to build cloud based accessible and customizable services for experts as well as non-specialists. We aim to provide an integrated solution for the ingestion, processing, analysis, exploration and visualization, interpretation and sharing of data generated by deep sequencing of full length antibody and TCR repertoire. The success of this Phase I SBIR will provide a solid foundation for the product launch of a commercial cloud based solution in Phase II, during which we will continue our investigation on big data security and privacy to facilitate compliance with institutional policies and design and develop programmable APIs and tools to facilitate integrations with more third party modules and services.',\n",
       " \"Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): ABSTRACT Title: MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL NICHE FOR TUBERCULOSIS Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in mankind due to infections and more than 8 million new cases occur each year with 2 million deaths per year. Emergence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and extraordinarily resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates has rendered the control of tuberculosis very difficult. A third of human population is infected with latent MTB from which active cases arise. Paradoxically, HIV-1 infection can deplete CD4 T cells and enhance co-infection due to tuberculosis and death rate. There is extensive lung damage during ongoing tuberculosis, tuberculosis during HIV infection, and in particular during MD/XDR tuberculosis. Urgent methods are required to repair and restore lung function and concurrently eradicate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) from the lungs of humans with and without HIV infection. Phase I studies show that transfusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs; aka.stem cells) into patients with MDR/XDR patents was safe and there was partial clinical improvement in lung function and systemic immunity. Human bone marrow derived MSCs are unique because they can be grown in large numbers in vitro and infused back into humans from both allogenic and autologous sources. We made a new discovery that rapamycin-activated stem cells internalized and killed MTB in vitro through enhanced autophagy. We now propose that such `conditioned stem cells' can be transfused into patients with MDR-XDR tuberculosis to obtain enhanced killing of MTB and concurrent restoration of lung function. Since the cell biological basis of stem cell mediated infection control remains unclear, we propose the following studies to optimize stem cell administration into humans for immunotherapy of tuberculosis. SPECIFIC AIM- 1: Investigate the mechanisms of receptor mediated phagocytic uptake, cytokine and oxidant responses of MTB by human mesenchymal stem cells. SPECIFIC AIM-2: Investigate the mechanisms of inducing and maintaining autophagy in mesenchymal stem cells to develop immunotherapeutic methods. Rationale: We discovered that in vitro conditioned mesenchymal stem cells killed mycobacteria including BCG and MTB. Since autologous MSCs have been transfused in a phase I study and found relatively safe, we will assess the cell biology of stem cells prior to transfusion by analyzing mechanisms of MTB uptake into stem cells and correlate with cytokines and growth factors. We will analyze various surface receptors, phagocytic phenomena and associated oxidant synthesis to understand how stem cells can be conditioned to kill MTB. Since autophagy killed MTB within stem cells, we will evaluate the multiple mechanisms of inducing autophagy and their effects on stem cells. Impact of the project: The prevalence of MDR/XDR tuberculosis and HIV infection renders the control of both TB and HIV difficult. Lung damage in tuberculosis is well established. Thus, newer methods fo immunotherapy is urgently required. Once stem cell biology is investigated and understood, we anticipate that that `conditioned and improved' stem cells can be transfused into patents for effective control for infection in the lungs. The availability of large numbers of stem cells, the expertise to analyze the cell biology of stem cells suggest that this proposal will have lasting impact on immunotherapy for lung specific disease.

       " 'Project Summary This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Rachel Rutishauser, MD, PhD, a fellow in Infectious Diseases at the University of California, San Francisco who is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented studies of HIV immunology. Her goal is to apply her PhD graduate school background in basic CD8+ T cell biology to study the mechanisms that underlie protective and dysfunctional immune responses in HIV infection. Nearly forty million people worldwide are infected with HIV and identifying interventions to induce HIV remission or cure is an NIH high priority research area. Many approaches propose to do so by eliciting protective HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. However, in order to be effective, these therapies need to overcome HIV- specific CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Exhaustion is defined as a loss in the regenerative capacity of antigen- specific CD8+ T cells to proliferate and generate functional effector cells. This K23 award will provide Dr. Rutishauser with the support to explore how HIV-specific CD8+ T cell exhaustion is regulated by: (1) memory CD8+ T cell-associated transcriptional programs, (2) tissue microenvironments, and (3) chronic inflammation. Specifically, she will perform phenotypic, functional, and single-cell transcriptomic analysis of HIV-specific MHC Class I tetramer+ CD8+ T cells from the peripheral blood, lymph node, and gut tissue of thirty HIV- infected individuals who she will recruit from the UCSF-based SCOPE cohort from three clinical groups: individuals who naturally control infection (controllers), as well as non-controllers on and off of antiretroviral therapy (ART). She will also determine if reducing chronic inflammation can enhance HIV-specific CD8+ T cell function by leveraging peripheral blood samples from an ongoing NIH-funded clinical study (NCT02272946) of ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals who are administered the IL-1? inhibitor, canakinumab. To achieve these goals, Dr. Rutishauser will be co-mentored by Dr. Peter Hunt, an HIV translational immunologist and expert in the mechanisms of HIV immune activation, Dr. Joseph Mike McCune, a laboratory-based scientist who has made several fundamental discoveries about HIV pathogenesis, Dr. Steven Deeks, a leader in the HIV cure field, and Dr. Mark Ansel, an immunologist with expertise in T cell differentiation. Through a focused program of mentored training and coursework, the candidate will develop advanced skills in clinical research, human translational immunology, and single-cell transcriptional analysis. The results of these studies are anticipated to be directly relevant to HIV cure research and widely applicable to developing treatments for other disease states in which exhausted antigen-specific CD8+ T cells arise, such as other chronic infections and cancer. Ultimately, the training and research plans outlined here will support Dr. Rutishauser as she transitions from being a basic immunologist and clinical infectious disease specialist to being a translational researcher equipped with the skills to pursue an independent career focused on elucidating the fundamental principles of CD8+ T cell biology and informing the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases.\",\n",
       " 'Statement of the Problem. Patients and families consistently rate end-of-life communication skills as vital to high- quality care and consistently report deficiencies in the quality of clinician communication around patient goals, values and beliefs. The accrediting bodies for medical schools, graduate medical education, and nursing schools all mandate communication training as a core competency. Thus, many programs have been developed to improve the quality of clinician-patient communication but for the most part they have not improved patient-centered outcomes. This may be in part due to limitations of traditional assessment methods that focus more on the quantity of communication behaviors (ie. whether they occur) without attention to their quality. Experts agree that a better, theory-driven assessment tool that captures the dynamic and complex way that end-of-life communication occurs is needed to improve communication, shared decision-making, and patient-centered outcomes. Specific Aims. This project will adapt a theory-based, validated communication assessment tool, Communication Quality Analysis (CQA), for use in clinician-patient encounters. Currently, CQA relies on transcribed recordings to analyze the conversations, precluding its routine use of CQA for assessing real-time encounters and provision of in-the-moment feedback. The main objectives of this study are to assess whether CQA can be reliably applied to standardized patient (SP) encounters and whether real-time coding CQA scores are comparable to those of the transcript-based CQA methodology. Secondary analyses will compare CQA scores to SP assessments of communication quality. Study Design. Conversations between medical or nursing trainees and SPs (108 conversations) will be video recorded, transcribed and coded by 8 trained coders. Four coders will code transcripts and 4 will code the video recordings without transcripts or pausing/rewinding the video to simulate a live encounter. Inter-rater reliabilities will be analyzed for both coding groups. To determine how well the transcript and real-time coding methods agree with each other, we will invoke generalizability theory by constructing a nonlinear mixed-effects model (accounting for repeated measurements on each trainee, the trainee?s gender, coder, and standardized patient encounter). A similar model will compare CQA scores to SP assessments of the trainees. Significance of the Results. The development of a theory-driven, easily implementable, and reliable communication assessment methodology offers a powerful educational tool to advance trainees? understanding of their communication performance that may improve how they discuss patient goals, values and beliefs. The success of this project will position us to explore: 1) using real-time CQA feedback as a teaching tool; 2) applying CQA to real patient encounters; and 3) using CQA to assess the efficacy of communication trainings on shared decision-making and patient-centered outcomes.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY For several decades, this and other laboratories have extensively investigated the causes and immune pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the prototypic systemic autoimmune disease. Despite considerable advances, particularly with regard to abnormalities in the adaptive immune system, several questions remained unanswered, including why autoantibodies in this disease are so often directed against nuclear antigens, and what is the initial trigger for these aberrant responses occurring even under sterile conditions? Emerging knowledge of a diverse array of mammalian sensors for nucleic acids, and the demonstration by us and others that these sensors are principal participants in lupus pathogenesis, have now provided new avenues of inquiry as to how this disease (and possibly many others) is initiated. We recently observed that congenic lupus-predisposed mice carrying an inactivating mutation of the proton/histidine transporter SLC15A4 (termed feeble) showed significantly reduced disease manifestations. The feeble mutation, discovered by others through ENU mutagenesis, has been shown to extinguish signaling by the endolysosomal TLR7 and TLR9, together with almost complete absence of production of type I interferons (IFN-I) and other proinflammatory cytokines by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) without affecting the development of these cells. Because of the apparent potential to therapeutically intervene with the function of SLC15A4, this proposal will seek to determine how the feeble mutation reduces autoimmunity by defining the functional characteristics of this molecule, the effects of the feeble mutation in lupus-associated innate and adaptive pathogenic responses, and ultimately to utilize high-throughput screening systems to identify pharmacologic inhibitors of this and other molecules necessary for self-nucleic acid sensing. The insights gained from these studies are certain to provide significant data on the biology of endolysosomes, TLRs and SLC15A4, and to reveal novel targets for therapeutic interventions in SLE and other autoimmune diseases.',\n",
       " 'Abstract. The cell adhesion receptor integrin ?V?8 is important for vascular and cardiac morphogenesis, lung epithelial homeostasis, CNS development, immune function, and latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) activation. Ligand binding and integrin activation are coupled in most integrins to two distinct, large conformational changes: extension at the bent integrin knees and opening of the ligand-binding headpiece. Thus, most integrins can equilibrate between two low affinity conformations, bent-closed and extended-closed, and a high affinity extended-open conformation. However, integrin ?V?8 is atypical because it is constitutively extended and resistant to ligand-induced headpiece opening. Moreover, the ?8 cytoplasmic domain lacks binding motifs for the cytoskeletal adaptors talin and kindlin, but binds a distinct cytoskeletal protein associated with lung adenocarcinoma, DAL-1. We will structurally and functionally characterize ?V?8 to determine the molecular mechanisms that govern its atypical behavior. In Aim 1, we obtain an overview of ?V?8 ectodomain and headpiece conformational states compared to ?V?6 by EM. We investigate whether binding of pro-TGF-?1 or a crossreacting, de novo designed ?V?6-binding protein (?V?6-BP) induces headpiece opening of ?V?8. We mutationally examine whether divergent sequences in ?8 metal-binding sites or in the ?I-hybrid interface stabilize the closed headpiece and whether divergent sequence at the ?-knee stabilizes the extended conformation. In Aim 2, we obtain crystal structures of the ?V?8 headpiece, its complexes with peptide ligand, pro-TGF-?1, or ?V?6-BP and a structure of the ?V?8 ectodomain. Structures will demonstrate how ?V?8 resists ligand-induced headpiece opening and maintains constitutive extension. In Aim 3, we investigate affinity and functional regulation of ?V?8 and transition to developing a potential therapeutic. We characterize the structure of the ?8 cytoplasmic domain bound to DAL-1 and investigate the role of this interaction in ?V?8-mediated activation of latent pro-TGF-?1. We hypothesize that in vivo, the ?V?8 headpiece may be opened by inside-out signaling, and increase affinity for ligand. To establish whether headpiece opening of ?V?8 increases affinity, we will use mutations to release restraints on ?V?8 headpiece opening, measure their effect on affinity for ligand, and correlate increases in affinity with headpiece opening measured by EM. Structures of ?V?8 bound to current, highly potent ?V?6 and ?V?8 small molecule antagonists will explain their limited selectivity for ?V?6 and ?V?8. The insights obtained will guide development of second generation, highly selective, pure antagonist therapeutics to treat diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  ',\n",

She is an Investigator at Group Health Research Institute (GHRI) and Affiliate Professor of Medicine and Health Services at University of Washington. She is also an Associate Investigator at Veterans Affairs (VA) Puget Sound Health Care System. She has conducted groundbreaking research aimed at implementation of evidence-based care for risky drinking and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in primary care. Her achievements include validation of the 3-item AUDIT-C in VA and non- VA populations and collaboration with clinical and quality leaders in the VA to implement alcohol screening and brief interventions (BIs) in over 900 VA sites nationwide. She has now expanded her focus to include management of AUDs in primary care. Dr. Bradley's currently funded studies aimed at improving alcohol- related primary care include: the CHOICE trial of nurse-delivered collaborative care for AUDs (NIAAA R01); a pragmatic trial of implementation of alcohol screening and BIs, and shared decision-making for AUDs, in 25 primary care clinics (AHRQ R18); and a study to develop a decision aid to support shared decision-making between primary care providers and their patients with AUDs (NIAAA R21). MENTORING EXPERIENCE and PLANNED MENTORING: Dr. Bradley is an outstanding mentor who has successfully mentored 28 early career clinician investigators. The proposed K24 will allow her to recruit and mentor 10-15 early-stage clinician researchers committed to patient-centered alcohol-related implementation research during the 5-year award. CAREER DEVELOPMENT: The proposed career award will support Dr. Bradley in achieving 3 career objectives: 1) to remain at the forefront of alcohol-related implementation research in medical settings; 2) to develop new expertise for implementing and evaluating eHealth interventions for AUDs-online and mobile health programs-in primary care; and 3) to mentor the next generation of innovators in alcohol-related research in medical settings.

       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondrial diseases are common and devastating conditions with an extremely poor prognosis. Gene therapies have been proposed involving allotopic expression of recoded mitochondrial genes from the nucleus, however, the viability of such an approach remains controversial. We have discovered that the major technical hurdles to such an approach that limit the development of a novel gene therapy are competition from the endogenous mutant protein in the complex and the hydrophobicity of these proteins. We have discovered a novel mitochondrial translation inhibition (TLI) approach to prevent expression of the mutant protein within mitochondria. We propose to test the combination of mitochondrial TLI with a novel therapy approach that targets coding RNAs to mitochondria. Such an approach directly addresses both technical hurdles using novel and previously untested methods. Any serious investigation aimed at developing a novel mitochondrial gene therapy would require a well-characterized, pathogenic, endogenous mitochondrial mutation in an amenable genetic system where feasibility can be demonstrated and optimized in vivo. We propose a rigorous test of mitochondrial TLI and mitochondrial-targeted RNA expression using several biochemical and phenotypic assays of function in a well-characterized animal model system.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary While mitochondrial dysfunction is evident in the failing heart, its precise role in disease progression is unclear and the mechanism(s) of its origin is not well understood. Mitochondria play a key role in many cellular processes, including oxidative phosphorylation, metabolite synthesis and calcium storage. They are also important regulators of cell death and monitor changes in the intracellular environment such as presence of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage. The BCL-2 proteins play a key role in regulating mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. We recently discovered that the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein MCL-1 is critical for normal mitochondrial function and cardiac homeostasis. Loss of MCL-1 in cardiac myocytes leads to rapid mitochondrial dysfunction, development of heart failure, and early mortality. Surprisingly, MCL-1 deficient myocytes display signs of necrosis rather than apoptosis as would be expected, suggesting that besides its anti- apoptotic role, MCL-1 has an essential but yet unidentified role in maintaining mitochondrial function in cardiac myocytes. We have also found that MCL-1 exists both in the outer mitochondrial membrane (MCL-1OM) and in the mitochondrial matrix (MCL-1Matrix) in the heart. While a study has implicated MCL-1OM in regulating apoptosis, the function of MCL-1Matrix is still unknown. Based on our preliminary data, we propose to study the hypothesis that MCL-1 has a dual role in maintaining cardiac mitochondrial function and health that is dependent on its mitochondrial location: MCL-1OM facilitates mitochondrial fission and mitophagy of aberrant mitochondria to prevent activation of unnecessary apoptosis, whereas MCL-1Matrix promotes mitochondrial fusion to preserve bioenergetic capacity and protect against autophagosomal degradation during nutrient limiting conditions. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize the role of MCL-1Matrix in regulating mitochondrial fusion, function, turnover and survival. In Specific Aim 2, we will delineate the role of MCL-1OM in regulating mitochondrial fission and turnover. We will determine if MCL-1OM interacts with Drp1 to promote asymmetrical fission and removal of damaged mitochondria and whether this is part of its pro-survival function. Finally, in Specific Aim #3, we will investigate whether MCL-1OM also functions as a receptor for LC3 to drive selective degradation of mitochondrial by autophagosomes. We will utilize both isolated cardiac myocytes and genetically modified mouse models combined with proteomics, cell and molecular biology to uncover the bi- functional roles of MCL-1OM and MCL-1Matrix in myocytes under baseline conditions and in response to challenge (fasting and myocardial infarction). These studies will provide important new insights into the relationship between mitochondrial dynamics, turnover and survival in the heart. A better understanding of how mitochondrial function is regulated in the heart under normal and disease conditions such as myocardial infarct will contribute towards future clinical management of heart disease.

       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes major organ damage and shortens lifespan in relatively young persons. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to improving outcomes for SLE patients. However, evidenced-based approaches to early treatment interventions and the appropriate target population for these interventions are not available. We propose that individuals who have positivity for antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and who also exhibit some of the other features that are used to classify SLE, are at high risk of progressing to the full systemic form of this disease. These individuals, who have significant levels of ANA with 1 or 2 additional items from the lupus classification criteria, are considered to have incomplete lupus erythematosus or ILE. We propose to treat ILE patients with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the ?Study of Anti- Malarials in Incomplete Lupus Erythematosus? or SMILE trial. The primary objective is to determine whether HCQ treatment can prevent acquisition of additional clinical and immunologic features that define SLE. The major secondary objectives are to determine whether HCQ treatment: (1) lessens lupus disease activity as measured by standard scoring indices; (2) improves patient reported outcomes (3) prevents accumulation of immunologic abnormalities including autoantibodies and cytokines and (4) has an acceptable toxicity profile. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. To carry out a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized trial of HCQ vs. placebo in patients with ILE. The study tests the hypothesis that early use of HCQ can modify disease features so that accumulation of abnormalities leading to a classification of SLE can be significantly slowed. 2. To determine effects of HCQ on disease activity and patient-reported outcomes in patients with ILE. 3. To characterize the immunologic profile of HCQ in ILE-treated patients. Autoantibodies, cytokines and chemokines will be measured on multiplex arrays for developing insights into underlying mechanisms. 4. To quantitatively assess the incidence of ophthalmologic toxicity in HCQ-treated ILE patients. All enrolled patients will have standardized ophthalmologic examinations before and after study treatment. Recommendations for use and monitoring in this patient population will be developed. The SMILE trial will determine whether or not HCQ should be given to ILE patients, will provide insights into the appropriate target population, and will propose candidate biomarkers to guide treatment decisions. While not part of the Precision Medicine InitiativeÂ®, SMILE is consistent with its goals. It will be the first step towards testing the feasibility of disease prevention studies in SLE and will accumulate biological samples in a repository that will be available to the lupus research community for further in-depth mechanistic studies.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop Cardio Thoracic Events and Decompensated heart failure (INVESTED) I s a multi-center, randomized, double blind, active-control trial of high dose influenza vaccine compared to standard dose influenza vaccine for three seasons in adult participants with a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure. The primary outcome measure is the composite of death or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, and secondary outcomes include composite of cardiopulmonary death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization, all-cause death or all-cause hospitalization, all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, cardiopulmonary death, and all cause death. Background: The substantial number of individuals in North America with myocardial infarction or heart failure (HF) are at high risk for influenza infection and associated morbidity, mortality and increased health care costs despite annual influenza vaccination. Higher dose of vaccine is approved for use in older adults but not in patients with heart failure. Antibody-mediated immunity contributes to vaccine-induced protection from influenza illness. Preliminary data: Our research group has shown in a meta-analysis that influenza vaccine reduces the risk for cardiovascular events and has also demonstrated reduced antibody titers to influenza vaccination in patients with HF. Additionally, we've shown in a pilot study that double dose influenza vaccine resulted in increased titers and was well tolerated. Methods: A multi-center, randomized, double blinded randomized trial will be conducted with 4650 patients assigned to the standard dose vaccine dose and 4650 patients to high dose influenza vaccine. The primary outcome measure is the composite of death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization, assessed at the end of each influenza season. Secondary outcomes will include the composite of death or cardiovascular hospitalizations, death or all-cause hospitalizations, and mortality. The study will also examine associations between geometric mean antibody titers and risk for death or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations. Significance: A positive trial may be able to provide crucial information to infom health care policy regarding optimal influenza vaccination dosing among individuals with high risk cardiovascular disease.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death in the developed world, accounting for near 30% of all deaths globally and 35% in the US annually. Coronary artery disease (CAD) with its associated thrombotic risk is responsible for 1 of 6 deaths in the US. Coincidentally, implantable blood recirculating devices, which have provided lifesaving solutions to patients with severe cardiovascular diseases, are burdened with thrombosis and thromboembolic complications, mandating complex life-long anticoagulation. The mechanisms underlying vascular disease processes and device-related thrombotic complications are intertwined. Thrombosis in vascular disease is potentiated by the interaction of blood constituents with an injured vascular wall and the non-physiologic flow patterns generated in cardiovascular pathologies initiate and enhance the hemostatic response by chronically activating the platelets. Similarly, device thrombogenicity is induced by pathological flow fields and contact with foreign surfaces. Upon activation platelets undergo complex biochemical and morphological changes. The coupling of the disparate spatio-temporal scales between molecular level events and the macroscopic transport represents a major modeling and computational challenge, which requires a multidisciplinary integrated multiscale numerical approach. Continuum approaches are limited in their ability to cover the smaller molecular mechanisms such as filopodia formation during platelet activation. Utilizing molecular dynamics (MD) to cover the multiscales involved is computationally prohibitive. In this application we offer to develop a comprehensive state-of-the-art multiscale numerical methodology that will be able to bridge the gap between the macroscopic transport and the ensuing molecular events. We will use an integrated Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) and Coarse Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD) approach that allows platelets to continuously change their shape and synergistically activate by a biomechanical transductive linkage chain, interact with other blood constituents and clotting factors, aggregate, and interact and adhere to the blood vessels and devices. In this multiscale model, a mechanotransduction CGMD bottom platelet activation model is embedded into a DPD blood flow top model. The dynamic stresses of the macroscale model will be interactively translated to the micro to nanoscale model of the intra-platelet associated intracellular events. The model predictions will be validated in vitro in a carefully designed set of experiments. This will be achieved according to the following specific aims: We will develop a mechanotransduction model of platelet mediated thrombosis where a top/macro-scale model of flow-induced thrombogenicity using DPD at the Âµm-length and ms-time scales, in which multiple flowing platelets interact with each other and blood vessel walls or devices, will be fully coupled with a bottom/micro-scale model using CGMD at the nm-length and ps-time scales, in which platelets with multiple intracellular constituents evolve during activation as platelet lose their quiescent discoid shape and filopodia grow. The top and bottom models will be interfaced such that the hemodynamics will interactively respond to platelet shape change upon activation and platelet aggregation and thrombus is formed. The effect of modulating platelet mechanical properties via antiplatelet agents will be modeled as well. All model aspects will be validated in vitro in a series of carefully designed experiments characterizing the mechanical properties of platelets and using blood flow experiments where conditions leading to flow induced platelet activation will be replicated, as well as experiments where platelet-wall and platelet device interactions will be measured and where platelets will be pretreated with modulating agents. These data will be used to fine tune the large number of model parameters involved in this multiscale simulation and for validating the model predictions. An independent 3rd party evaluation of the model credibility is also included as an integral part of the project. e will also concentrate on the development of efficient algorithms adapted for ultra-scalable large HPC clusters to reduce prohibitive computation costs, so as to bring such ambitious large multiscale simulations within the reach of the multiscale modeling community at large and enable to adopt it to other relevant modeling needs and interests. To further enable these technologies, large sharable data base will be created where software tools, numerical codes, model and experimental data and protocols will be deposited and guidance will be provided for using them. The leaders of the project will be active in various MSM consortium working groups to further disseminate the project outcomes and share them with the modeling community. The methodology proposed represents a paradigm shift in the burgeoning field of multiscale simulations and its application to solving complex clinical problems at the interface of engineering and biology. Predicting the progression of arterial thrombosis under circulation conditions, providing tools for improved pharmacological management as compared to existing empirics-based treatments, and providing a modeling tool for developing the next generation of devices with reduced thrombogenicity may lead to reduced mortality rates, improved patients' quality of life, and an overall reduction of the financial burden of the ensuing healthcare costs.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal dissects the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the epigenetic phenomenon of genomic imprinting. Imprinted gene expression is enriched in the brain and ultimately affects neuron signaling, differentiation, and survival. Notably, lncRNAs originating from differentially methylated regions are functionally required for proper monoallelic expression of several imprinted genes. Detailed investigation on lncRNAs in the establishment and maintenance of genomic imprinting will have significant implications for imprinted disorders, such as Angelman syndrome, which results from loss of maternal Ube3a. The paternal copy of Ube3a is intact in patients, but silenced by a neuron-specific repressive lncRNA called Ube3a-ATS. While the mechanism of action is unknown, it has been demonstrated that inhibition of Ube3a-ATS partially restores Ube3a in Angelman syndrome. With more than 100 imprinted protein-coding genes identified to date, a comprehensive study of lncRNAs at imprinted loci will increase our mechanistic understanding of lncRNAs-mediated gene regulation. Here, in Specific Aim 1, an in vitro neuron differentiation system will be established that permits allele-specific transcriptome characterization. Embryonic stem cells from reciprocal crosses of divergent mouse subspecies will be harvested and differentiated to the neuronal lineage. In Specific Aim 2, this unique model system will be used to identify novel lncRNAs at imprinted loci. Transcriptome sequencing and alignment of allele-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms will be used to assign allelic biases in expression. In Specific Aim 3, the molecular mechanisms by which Ube3a-ATS regulates imprinted expression of Ube3a will be determined. CRISPR/Cas9-targeting strategies will be used to functionally dissect the activity of Ube3a-ATS in the epigenetic and transcriptional control of Ube3a in neurons. The long-term goals of this research are to leverage the fundamental activities of imprinted lncRNAs to therapeutically modulate imprinted genes in neurodevelopmental disorders.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that is caused by an expansion of CAG triplet repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The expanded CAG repeats in the mutant HTT gene are translated into a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract that confers a deleterious gain of function on the mutant protein. The structurally altered mutant (m)HTT interacts with and inactivates critical factors; loss of function of these factors disrupts transcription of specific genes, synaptic function, calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial dynamics and energetics in HD. Additionally, accumulation of DNA damage and aberrant activation of DNA damage-response (DDR) ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) signaling is also implicated in the HD pathomechanism. Notwithstanding these discoveries defining the underlying disease mechanisms, the early instigating processes by which mHTT induces these pathological changes and drives functional decline and neuronal loss remain unknown. This knowledge gap is a major rate-limiting step in developing a targeted therapeutic strategy to prevent neurological decline in HD; due to this limitation this degenerative illness remains untreatable and invariably fatal. In an important step forward, we have discovered that the normal HTT recruits polynucleotide kinase 3' phosphatase (PNKP), a major DNA strand break repair enzyme; ataxin-3 (ATXN3), a deubiquitinating enzyme; and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to form a transcription-dependent multi- protein DNA repair complex likely to be involved in the repair of actively transcribing genes. In contrast, mHTT disrupts the functional integrity of this repair complex and abrogates PNKP activity, resulting in DNA strand break accumulation to stimulate a pathogenic surge of DNA damage-response signaling in HD. The overall objective of this project is to characterize the molecular interactions by which mHTT impairs the enzymatic activities of PNKP and ATXN3, perturbs repair of the actively transcribed genes, and contributes to HD pathomechanism so that we can ultimately develop a preventive therapy for this terminal disease. These studies are designed to provide a mechanistic basis for neurodegeneration in HD and uncover the critical role of DNA repair therein. Aim 1 should confirm that mHTT alters the functional integrity of the transcription coupled repair complex, and inactivates PNKP to induce DNA strand breaks in the actively transcribing genes in HD. These studies should thus provide important insights into how polyQ expansion interferes with a specific DNA repair machinery to induce nuclear and mtDNA damage in HD. Aim 2 will provide critical mechanistic insights into how mHTT triggers pro-apoptotic stimuli to cause neurotoxicity in HD. Aim 3 will test the effectiveness of PNKP overexpression in the mutant cells and in HD transgenic mouse model in decreasing DNA lesions, preventing or slowing down DDR pathway activation in HD. These studies should confirm that mutant HTT-mediated impairment of neuronal DNA repair contributes to neurotoxicity in HD, and identify proximal molecular targets to develop mechanism-based therapeutic strategies for HD.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of clonal diseases of mutated hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), with more than 30,000 new cases being diagnosed each year in the Unites States. Given limited therapeutic options, long-term survival is less than 5% and new therapies are urgently needed. Genes encoding components of the cohesin complex are commonly mutated in human myeloid diseases, including 11% of patients with MDS and 21% of patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) arising in the context of MDS. Mutations in the cohesin subunit STAG2 have been recently identified as MDS-defining driver lesions. It is not understood how these mutations lead to MDS or leukemia, or whether cells with these mutations have vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically. Using quantitative immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry in STAG2 knockout cells, we identified incorporation of STAG1 into the mutant cohesin complex and loss of its interaction with splicing and RNA binding proteins. We also identified a synthetic lethal interaction between STAG1 and STAG2 loss, and CDK4 and STAG2 loss, the latter of which we corroborated by demonstrating selective killing of STAG2 knockout cells with CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011 in vitro. Lastly, we demonstrated that STAG2 and STAG1 containing cohesin complexes have differential chromatin binding patterns. In light of these preliminary data, we hypothesize that STAG2 mutations alter cohesin complex formation and its chromatin association, with subsequent effects on gene expression through changes in critical long-range DNA looping interactions. To further define the mechanistic basis of mutant STAG2 mediated transformation in MDS, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Examine the effect of STAG2 loss on the composition of the cohesin complex; (2) Determine the transcriptional and epigenetic consequences of STAG2 inactivation; and (3) Validate CDK4 as a novel therapeutic target in STAG2 deficient cells in vivo. Mechanistic understanding of the STAG2 mutant cohesin complex promises to offer biological insight into MDS and identify new therapeutic opportunities. The applicant Dr. Zuzana Tothova is mentored by Dr. Benjamin Ebert, a physician scientist and expert in MDS, and co-mentored by Dr. Richard Young, a leader in the field of chromatin biology. Dr. Tothova has outlined a four-year career development plan to meet her goal of becoming an independent investigator in translational hematology, and she has assembled an Advisory Committee of internationally recognized experts to provide career and scientific mentorship. Dana Farber Cancer Institute is the ideal environment for completion of her scientific and career goals, given its outstanding research community and substantial record of training independent physician scientists.',\n",
       " 'Abstract It is increasingly clear that people with schizophrenia have a range of visual perception impairments, including in low-level vision (e.g., acuity, contrast sensitivity) and mid-level vision (e.g., perceptual organization, coherent motion detection). These impairments are significantly related to poorer performance on cognitive (e.g., visual learning and memory) and social cognitive (e.g., facial emotion decoding) measures, and to worse functional outcomes. To date, there is no accepted technique for visual remediation for schizophrenia, and almost no work has been done in this area. However, visual remediation is a well-developed subfield within cognitive rehabilitation for TBI patients, and initial studies of short-term visual perceptual learning in schizophrenia indicate that plasticity exists that could support longer-term changes. Therefore, the overall goal of the proposed project is to test a visual remediation intervention for schizophrenia and determine its effects on specific visual targets with well-understood neurobiological mechanisms. The goal of the R61 is to determine the optimal intervention for improving the targets of contrast sensitivity (CS) and perceptual organization (PO). Extensive evidence exists for impaired CS and PO in schizophrenia. Moreover, these targets are prototypical examples of gain control and integration, respectively, which were identified by the NIMH-sponsored CNTRICS initiative as being the two core mechanisms involved in visual disturbances in the disorder. We will examine two computer-based interventions. One, ULTIMEYES (UE), targets CS. The other, contour integration training (CIT), targets PO. We will also examine the effects of combined treatment (UE&CIT). An active computer-based control treatment will be included. There will be 40 sessions, with assessments after every 10 sessions (N=20/group). The R61 Specific Aim is to evaluate the effects of UE and CIT on CS and PO targets, respectively, to determine if treatment effects meet a pre-specified effect-size criterion. Results of the R61 will be used to identify the treatment (UE, CIT, or UE&CIT) and duration (i.e., dose) that most effectively and efficiently improves the target(s). The goal of the R33 is to conduct an initial randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the optimal treatment identified in the R61. The R33 Specific Aims are to: 1) replicate and extend R61 results supporting visual target engagement in an adequately powered RCT (N=50/group); and 2) determine if visual target engagement is associated with improvements in cognition, social cognition, and functional capacity. If the R33 hypotheses are confirmed, results will inform the design of a later RCT to further explore mediators and moderators of treatment effects, and to move towards a precision medicine approach, wherein we determine which individuals are most likely to benefit from this intervention.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary ocular infections are not regularly notifiable to the US Center for Disease Control. Infectious ocular disease epidemics are not regularly reported, tracked, or predicted in the US, despite the fact that tracking would be of clear benefit to the eye health community. We hypothesize that several novel digital surveillance approaches can improve monitoring and detection of ocular disease epidemics, starting with one or the more common model eye infection: conjunctivitis. Severe outbreaks of conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus (epidemic keratoconjunctivitis or EKC) or bacteria occur without warning and sporadically in location and time. Epidemics are highly contagious with a significant burden of cost in the US, although long-term vision impairment is unusual. Risk factors for these and other ocular disease epidemics may be on the rise, and budgetary cuts may further reduce funding for traditional surveillance reporting and prevention. Thus new solutions are needed for monitoring ocular disease epidemics. Recently web searches, social media, and other sourced digital big data has been used to track infectious diseases. Here, we propose (Aim1) to identify candidate ocular disease epidemics using big data through a number of statistical approaches, as well as to (Aim2) use medical records and also develop a digital sentinel network of specialists for participatory surveillance, in order to validate any candidate epidemics, and (Aim3) Since even the health records and other clinical reports in Aim2 are not a perfect gold standard, we will also use a hidden state model to estimate, for each methodology, the sensitivity and specificity (and other appropriate descriptors) of detection of a true conjunctivitis epidemic.',\n",
       " 'e-Cigarettes, also known as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are a rapidly growing nicotine delivery product with millions of users in the United States and worldwide. All e-cigarettes have common features: a battery; a tank containing propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin, flavoring agents, and nicotine; a microprocessor; an activating button; and, in some, a variable voltage heating element. The heating element vaporizes the solution producing liquid aerosol droplets containing nicotine. The amount of nicotine inhaled is controlled by the user by varying the voltage. There is little doubt that e-cigarettes are safer than tobacco cigarettes because they lack tobacco and combustion. However, the safety of e-cigarettes per se requires evaluation, particularly in view of recent reports that they may generate unacceptable levels of the human carcinogen formaldehyde, and our preliminary data indicating that levels of urinary biomarkers of oxidative damage and inflammation ? the F2-isoprostane 8-iso-PGF2? and the prostaglandin E2 metabolite PGEM - are the same in e- cigarette users as in cigarette smokers. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that e-cigarette use leads to formaldehyde-DNA adducts and elevated exposure to other carbonyls, and to similar levels of oxidative damage and inflammation as in smokers, and will assess toxicant and carcinogen exposure in e-cigarette users, smokers, and non-smokers. Our specific aims are: 1. Quantify exogenous [13CD2]formaldehyde-DNA adducts and unlabeled endogenous  formaldehyde-DNA adducts in tissues of rats exposed to vapor generated from e-liquids  containing [1-13CD2]propylene glycol. 2. Using samples from a prior study in which smokers stopped smoking for 12 weeks, determine the  time course of decreases in formaldehyde-DNA adducts in leukocytes, and 8-iso-PGF-2? and  PGEM in urine.3. Recruit 134 e-cigarette tank system users, 134 smokers, and 134 non-users of any e-cigarette or  tobacco product and compare levels of formaldehyde, diacetyl, and other carbonyl compounds in  saliva (before and after puffing in the e-cigarette users and smokers), formaldehyde-DNA  adducts in oral cells and leukocytes, 8-iso-PGF-2? and PGEM in urine, the serum biomarker of  inflammation C-reactive protein, as well as a panel of urinary toxicant and carcinogen biomarkers,  sampled monthly for 6 months. Only e-cigarette users who have not smoked a tobacco  cigarette for the amount of time determined to be necessary for clearance of biomarkers to non-smoker levels in Specific Aim 2 will be enrolled, and this group will include e-cigarette users who operate their devices at predominantly high and low voltages (above and below 4V) as well as some individuals who will vary the voltage of their e-cigarette system.Collectively, the results of this study will critically test our hypothesis and provide important data on the potential risks of e-cigarette use with respect to the human carcinogen formaldehyde and other carbonyl compounds, oxidative damage and inflammation, and exposure to a panel of toxicants and carcinogens.',\n",
       " 'The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Liver cirrhosis is the leading cause of end-stage liver disease. A hallmark of cirrhosis is fibrogenesis: secretion and deposition of excess extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Prominent among secreted ECM proteins is collagen I. Although the role of collagen I deposition in cirrhosis is well known, therapies aimed at disrupting fibrogenesis are lacking. This is due in part to our poor understanding of procollagen I trafficking through the secretory pathway. Fibrogenic signals such as TGF? drive expression of the collagen I precursor procollagen I, which is subsequently cotranslationed into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Procollagen I fibrils oligomerize within the ER, forming a complex too large (~300nm) to package into canonical ER export vesicles (60-90nm). Thus, additional, unknown cellular machinery is necessary for procollagen I trafficking. If this machinery is disrupted, procollagen fibrils would be retained in the ER and lead to ER stress, activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and possibly apoptosis. Recent elegant studies performed in non-liver cells suggested that TANGO1 is critical for the transport of procollagens. Whether TANGO1 facilitates ER export and secretion of collagen I from HSCs, a critical step in fibrogenesis, is unknown. We hypothesize that TANGO1 drives procollagen I export from the ER, requires UPR signaling to mediate this effect, and together TANGO1 and the UPR are critical for fibrogenesis in vivo. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data showing (a) TANGO1 knockdown disrupts procollagen I ER export, leading to UPR signaling and HSC apoptosis, (b) TANGO1 expression is mediated, at least in part, by the UPR-activated transcription factor XBP1, and (c) TANGO1+/- mice are protected from cirrhosis development. The novelty and relevance of studying the role of TANGO1 in procollagen I trafficking and its regulation are two-fold: 1) we can identify new targets to disrupt collagen I secretion in fibrogenesis, and 2) failure to resolve ER stress driven by procollagen I retention may lead to HSC apoptosis. The latter mechanism is favorable for fibrosis resolution. Our long-term goal is to elucidate mechanisms of procollagen I trafficking within HSCs and identify novel therapeutic targets to treat liver cirrhosis. The research proposed here will utilize rigorous in vitro and in vivo approaches to unveil the mechanisms of TANGO1-mediated procollagen I trafficking in HSCs, the regulatory relationship between TANGO1 and the UPR during HSC activation, and finally the role of TANGO1 and the UPR in fibrogenesis and fibrosis regression.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY There are very few controlled studies on the oral health of older HIV-infected individuals, especially postmenopausal women. This is of particular concern in the U.S, where more than half of HIV-infected individuals are over age 50. Our group has previously demonstrated that skeletal bone loss at the spine and hip is greater and fracture rates higher in HIV-infected than uninfected women after menopause. Our preliminary data also show that HIV-infected women over age 50 had greater alveolar bone loss and a trend for fewer teeth compared to age-matched uninfected controls. However, the separate and/or combined contribution of HIV infection and estrogen deficiency to oral immune activation and the observed alveolar bone loss is uncertain. Therefore, the goal of this study is to determine the extent and progression of periodontal disease in HIV-infected pre- and postmenopausal women on cART and to investigate the contribution of periodontal immune activation to its pathogenesis. We hypothesize that HIV-infection is associated with increased oral immune activation. Loss of the beneficial immune-modulatory effects of estrogen results in an increased inflammatory response to periodontal pathogens, and greater alveolar bone loss after menopause. In order to examine this, we propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1: To determine the impact of HIV infection and menopause on periodontal health in a cross sectional study 240 HIV-infected and uninfected pre- and post- menopausal women. HIV-infected postmenopausal women will have evidence of worsened clinical periodontal parameters, higher GCF inflammatory biomarkers, greater alveolar bone loss and fewer teeth than uninfected post-menopausal women, and both HIV-infected and uninfected pre-menopausal women. Aim 2: To define the oral immune response in HIV-infected and uninfected postmenopausal women during the induction and resolution of gingival inflammation using the experimental gingivitis model. The clinical, GCF and gingival tissue cytokine response during induction of gingivitis will be greater, and the resolution of the inflammatory response more attenuated in HIV-infected post-menopausal women compared to uninfected postmenopausal women or HIV-infected women on hormone replacement therapy. Aim 3: To delineate the clinical, oral immune, and alveolar bone response to standard-of-care periodontal treatment in HIV-infected and uninfected postmenopausal women with moderate periodontitis. Improvements in clinical periodontal parameters, GCF biomarkers, and alveolar bone density and microarchitecture will be less in HIV-infected than uninfected postmenopausal women with moderate periodontitis in response to oral hygiene instruction, scaling/root planing and periodontal maintenance. If proven correct, these studies provide rationale for investigating use of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), as a safe and testable intervention to prevent periodontal disease progression and/or alveolar bone loss in HIV-infected postmenopausal women.',\n",
       " 'Abstract: Cancer Immunotherapy Through Intratumoral Activation of Recall Responses The overarching goal for this project is to elucidate whether recall antigen expression in the tumor microenvironment can be used to enhance cancer immunotherapy, or potentially, serve as a new anti-cancer modality. These studies will also determine whether immunological memory/pre- existing immunity against an oncolytic poliovirus, PVSRIPO, is an impediment or asset to therapy. PVSRIPO is showing remarkable promise in patients with glioblastoma, recently received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA, and represents a unique approach delivering a potent human recall antigen (polio capsid) into human tumors. Surmounting evidence indicates that recall response activation leads to both innate and adaptive inflammation, capable of inducing immune responses against new antigens. This proposal seeks to harness the power of these responses to enhance cancer immunotherapy. This will be accomplished through testing the role of pre-existing anti-polio immunity on PVSRIPO therapy in mouse models of melanoma and brain cancer in affecting both efficacy and antitumor immunity. Additionally, polio and tetanus antigens, which are recall antigens for nearly everyone in the world, will be exogenously delivered into murine melanoma and brain tumors to test if intratumoral inflammation and engagement of antitumor immunity occurs in mice with recall responses to these antigens. Lastly, an in vitro human system will be used to evaluate the effects of recall antigen induced inflammation on antigen presenting cells and priming of new T cells. These studies aim to exhaustively test the adjuvant potential of recall responses in the context of cancer immunotherapy; which has remained an unexplored route to engage antitumor immunity to date.',\n",
       " \"The proposed research seeks to determine whether text messages/messaging (TM) or a mobile application (app), compared with an educational website-control provided to all Veterans, can improve adherence to antiplatelet therapy among patients following acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention (ACS/PCI). Adherence to antiplatelet medications is critical to prevent life- threatening complications (i.e., stent thrombosis); yet rates of non-adherence range from 21-57% by 12 months. Mobile technology through TM or mobile apps is a practical and inexpensive strategy to promote behavior change and enhance medication adherence. The three specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine preferences for content and frequency of TM to promote medication adherence through focus groups; 2) determine the most patient-centered app to promote adherence through a content analysis of all commercially available apps for medication adherence and focus groups centered on usability; and 3) compare adherence to antiplatelet medications in 225 Veterans post ACS/PCI through a randomized clinical trial. Participants will be randomized to either TM, mobile app, or website-control group. The focus groups will be stratified by low/high mobile phone use and sex. In addition, the proposed work will provide Dr. Park with the mentorship and experience necessary to establish herself as an early career investigator in the fields of cardiovascular disease prevention and mobile health research. Dr. Park's primary career goal is to become an independent nurse investigator who applies novel technology for patient-centered behavioral interventions to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for cardiac patients and Veterans. Dr. Park has assembled an outstanding interdisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in the required areas of training. Eileen Collins, PhD, RN will serve as Primary Nurse Mentor; Mary Whooley, MD will serve as VA On-Site Mentor; and Janet Shim, PhD will serve as Qualitative Research Mentor. In addition, John Boscardin, PhD will conduct all quantitative statistical analyses related to the study. Consultants include Yoshimi Fukuoka, RN, PhD (expert in mobile health strategies) and Dr. Michael Ho (expert in medication adherence and cardiovascular disease). Susan Woods, MD, MPH (Director of Patient Experience, Connected Health, Office of Information and Analytics, VHA) will serve as a collaborator, particularly in relationship to our use of ?Annie,? the new VA automated TM program with a goal to help patients take a more active role in their health. The Nursing Research Initiative will provide Dr. Park with an exceptional opportunity to receive the mentorship and experience necessary to prepare a strong scientific foundation for a compelling Investigator Initiated Research proposal to evaluate clinical outcomes (i.e., cardiac morbidity and mortality) through a multi-site full scale RCT. Determining the efficacy of mobile technology through a Veteran-designed protocol to promote medication adherence will have a significant impact on Veteran health and public health, particularly for individuals with chronic diseases that require strict medication adherence.  \",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Pompe disease is an inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid ?- glucosidase, which results in progressive phrenic neuropathology. Since available enzyme replacement therapy does not treat this neuropathology, diaphragm/phrenic neuromuscular dysfunction ultimately leads to ventilatory insufficiency and ventilator dependence. Consequently, respiratory complications are the leading cause of mortality in Pompe disease. Diaphragm pacing is an alternative approach to treat critical ventilatory insufficiency, activating phrenic axons through intramuscular electrodes. Exciting preliminary data from patients with Pompe disease who have undergone diaphragm pacing suggests it may do more than replace the need for mechanical ventilation. It may have a rehabilitative effect on diaphragm/phrenic activity, restoring some independence from ventilatory support of any kind. While these initial findings are encouraging, pacing-induced neuromuscular plasticity has scarcely been studied. The fundamental hypothesis guiding this proposal is that diaphragm pacing is a novel rehabilitative tool to increase diaphragm/phrenic activity, thereby improving the capacity for independent tidal volume generation. In this way, diaphragm pacing may promote ventilator weaning in Pompe disease. We will recruit patients with Pompe disease who have undergone intramuscular pacemaker implantation to replace chronic mechanical ventilation, and then evaluate the rehabilitative effects of pacing over 12 weeks on diaphragm/phrenic neuromuscular activity and recovery of independent breathing ability. During spontaneous breathing and maximal voluntary efforts, we will investigate pacing effects on breathing function. In addition, direct recordings of human diaphragm EMG activity using an innovative application of the diaphragm intramuscular electrodes will enable longitudinal evaluations of diaphragm/phrenic activity. To test our central hypothesis, we propose two specific aims: 1) test the hypothesis that a single bout of diaphragm pacing has lasting effects on diaphragm/phrenic activation and ventilation, and 2) test the hypothesis that these effects accumulate over 12 weeks of repeated, daily diaphragm pacing sessions. This high risk/high impact proposal will evaluate diaphragm pacing as a rehabilitative tool to increase diaphragm/phrenic activity and improve independent breathing ability. This work will provide the first controlled, empirical evidence concerning the ability of diaphragm pacing to rehabilitate phrenic neuromuscular function in Pompe disease, and may have profound implications for the use of diaphragm stimulation in other clinical disorders that compromise breathing. Our hope is that data generated in this study will form the basis for a future mechanistic study of diaphragm pacing to promote ventilator weaning in neuromuscular disease.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is predicted to be the most burdensome disease worldwide by the year 2030. Improved understanding of the neural circuits mediating key psychological processes that go awry in the disorder will facilitate development of novel treatments for MDD. Reduced interest in pursuing previously rewarding stimuli (anhedonia) is a core symptom of MDD. The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is critical to the pursuit of rewards under normal conditions, and clinical neuroimaging studies suggest this system to be hypoactive in MDD. The unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) animal model has been a useful means to study this phenomenon in rodents. Following UCMS, animals show decreased motivated behavior, which can be restored with DA system excitation. An important question that remains unanswered, however, is why the DA system is functioning improperly in MDD. Our lab has recently shown that the DA system is hypoactive in animals that have undergone UCMS (as well as learned helplessness), due to enhanced afferent inhibition of DA neurons located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We have delineated a circuit whereby increased basolateral amygdala (BLA) drive of the ventral pallidum (VP) following UCMS leads to a potent reduction in VTA DA neuron population activity (number of active DA neurons), and this appears to be critical to the mechanism whereby UCMS reduces DA system tone. However, this circuit presently omits two regions proposed to be important nodes in MDD circuitry in humans: the subgenual cingulate cortex (BA25), whose rodent homologue is the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (ILPFC), and the lateral habenula (LHb). Human studies have shown BA25 to be overactive in MDD, as is also seen for the BLA, and thus a known projection from the ILPFC to the BLA may be driving the BLA over-activation that is critical to diminished DA activity seen following UCMS. Alternatively, the LHb has a more proximal projection to the VTA DA neurons and therefore over- activation of this region may, via the rostromedial tegmentum (RMTg), inhibit VTA DA neurons. We will therefore investigate the relative roles of these two regions in UCMS-induced DA system down-regulation, via the following aims: 1) To determine the impact on the DA system of activating efferent projections from ILPFC- >BLA and LHb->RMTg in normal rats using electrophysiological and behavioral readouts, 2) To assess whether inactivating the ILPFC->BLA or LHb->RMTg projections improves DA system function in animals that exhibit impaired motivation after undergoing UCMS, 3) To define the time course for the development of alterations in regional activity level in potential circuit nodes, including the ILPFC, BLA, LHb, RMTg, VP, and VTA. With greater understanding of the afferent structures potentially down-regulating the DA system in MDD, novel therapeutic interventions could specifically target aberrantly functioning nodes in this neural circuit.',\n",
       " 'Ankle osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating and mobility limiting condition. It can commonly stem from the result of a traumatic injury ? such trauma has a high prevalence in military service. If cartilage is not severely damaged in that trauma, the stability and alignment of the joint may be. Over time, an unstable or misaligned ankle joint can experience abnormal rates of cartilage wear and tear due to aberrant kinematics. While OA may take decades to develop, the resulting arthritic state from this trauma will ultimately require ankle replacement or fusion, consequences with a tremendous financial burden and quality of life impact.  With regards to alignment, particularly in the coronal plane, current clinical diagnosis relies on static X- ray of the ankle joint. Static images may not indicate dynamic misalignment during gait. Further, the effect of wedged insoles, a potential conservative treatment, on the restoration of ankle function is undocumented.  This proposal aims to use biplane fluoroscopy, an X-ray based dynamic imaging approach, to measure ankle kinematics in OA subjects (with varus, neutral and valgus ankle alignment) and controls. With this method, tibio-talar kinematics during gait can be measured. Furthermore, subjects classified as neutral from their static radiograph, but that exhibit ankle varus or valgus alignment during gait, will be identified. Improving the accuracy of a diagnostic outcome provides a patient group with additional avenues for treatment. We will investigate correlations between our 3D kinematics and clinical 2D imaging ? to the benefit of clinical diagnostics. We will also be able to measure the effect of wedged insoles on the restoration of ankle function. With this in mind, the following aims and methodology are proposed.  Specific Aim 1: To investigate ankle kinematics in controls and subjects with OA. In support of Specific Aim 1, 90 ankle OA subjects will be recruited (30 each of varus, neutral or valgus aligned ankles). We will also recruit 20 control subjects. Subjects will receive CT scans of their feet to quantify bone geometry (a step necessary for biplane fluoroscopy). Subjects will then be imaged in the biplane system during gait trials and while wearing neutral study shoes. This will yield tibio-talar kinematics during gait for these populations. Specific Aim 2: To identify dynamically misaligned ankles in OA subjects who are currently classified as neutrally aligned using static analysis. We will compare the static X-ray and the gait kinematics of OA subjects, particularly those with clinically determined neutral alignment. We will determine what proportion of neutral OA subjects actually exhibit misalignment during gait and are thus improperly categorized. We will also re-create 2D clinical X-ray views from our 3D data in an attempt to translate our improvement (with 3D fluoroscopy) to more accurately classify alignment to clinical 2D diagnostics. Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the potential of lateral or medial wedging to restore alignment in misaligned ankle OA subjects. OA subjects will be imaged wearing shoes with wedged insoles which correspond to their type of misalignment. Neutral OA subjects, who demonstrate misalignment during gait, will be recalled for a wedged insole session. This yields conservative treatment kinematics.  This study will generate baseline data describing the kinematics of control and ankle OA subjects. This data is not currently available in the literature, and represents a novel contribution to the field. Second, this proposal determines how accurate current 2D X-ray methods are at detecting dynamic misalignment. This information can inform clinicians about the accuracy of their diagnostic tools, and may lead to improvements. Third, this proposal will generate data to evaluate the utility of wedged insoles for the conservative management of ankle misalignment. In Summary, this study has immediate impact potential on the diagnosis and treatment of ankle OA. Last, there are numerous additional avenues of classification, diagnostic, and preventative research for the benefit of the veterans which will stem from this Career Development Award.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract This goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which tyrosine recombinases recognize and assemble on their target DNA sequences and achieve coordinated pairwise cleavage of DNA strands to reach a recombined product. The proposal is significant because tyrosine recombinases are widely used genome editing tools, but their potential for improving human health is currently hindered by lack of understanding of their mechanisms for site selection and for control over activity and recombination direction (i.e., integration versus excision). Innovation in this proposal arises from the application of solution NMR to address mechanistic knowledge gaps left unanswered by the many high resolution crystal structures of tyrosine recombinases in tetrameric complexes with DNA. Those structures have provided crisp snapshots of some of the important intermediates in the recombination pathway, but provide limited insight into the intermediates that precede them, or into the mechanisms that interconvert them. Our approach combines powerful protein- and DNA-engineering with sophisticated isotope labeling and NMR methods to characterize dynamics that enable interconversion of key intermediates in site-specific DNA recombination, focusing on those leading to site-specific assembly of the tetrameric synaptic complex, allosteric control over DNA cleavage, and isomerization of the Holliday junction (HJ) intermediate. To understand the conformational changes in both protein and DNA that accompany site selection, dimer assembly, tetramer synapsis and protomer activation, we will use solution NMR spectroscopy to: (1) determine the solution structure of Cre recombinase alone, and bound in pre-synapsed complexes with loxP DNA; (2) determine the role of protein dynamics in activating Cre for DNA cleavage by measuring dynamics in Cre and pre-synaptic complexes with DNA; (3) study how DNA intrinsic dynamics affects Cre recognition, synaptic assembly, control over Cre activity, and direction of recombination; (4) characterize the dynamic and allosteric communication pathways that enable isomerization of the central HJ for progression through the recombination reaction. To enable the NMR experiments on large homo-oligomeric complexes, we will leverage an arsenal of reagents and techniques for selective labeling of protein and DNA molecules, and for assembly of chimeric Cre-DNA complexes; together with uniform deuteration and TROSY methods, the simplified NMR spectra will facilitate resonance assignments and quantitative relaxation measurements. The proposed studies will advance our understanding of the role of dynamics in DNA recombination, and in DNA binding and remodeling enzymes in general. This knowledge could broadly impact biotechnology and its biomedical applications by facilitating the design of Cre variants with defined DNA sequence specificity and improved efficiency, and suggest new avenues for controlling its activity.',\n",
       " 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury is the main clinical challenge of adverse cardiovascular outcomes after myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery or circulatory arrest. It is well established that myocardial ATP depletion is a key feature of myocardial ischemia and heart failure1. Improving myocardial energy metabolism has been a well- known target to protect the heart from IR injury, but with little success.  ATP synthase is a key enzyme complex generating ATP in mitochondria, thus playing a central role in mitochondrial function. Functional defects of ATP synthase can cause and aggravate human diseases, such as cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. However, our understanding of the regulation of energy metabolism and mitochondrial function in the energy demanding heart remains poor. We have recently identified a PPAR-target gene encoding a novel mitochondrial protein ES1 with unknown function. Preliminary studies revealed that ES1 is a mitochondrial protein interacting with the subunits ? and ? of ATP synthase F1 sector. We were excited to find that ES1 works as an enhancer of ATP production by increasing ATP synthesis and inhibiting ATP hydrolysis. However, it remains unknown if ES1 similarly regulates ATP production in the heart subjected to myocardial IR. Interestingly, our preliminary studies revealed that ES1 protein levels were decreased in hearts with myocardial IR injury of patients and mice. Based on the pilot studies on conditional transgenic and gene targeting mouse lines, we hypothesize that ES1 is a novel therapeutic target of protecting the heart from myocardial IR via its role in facilitating cardiac energy production/reservation. To test this central hypothesis, we will first define the role of ES1 as an endogenous regulator of ATP synthase and as a determinant of mitochondrial structure/function in the heart. We will then determine if transgenic and adenoviral-associated virus-mediated ES1 overexpression in the heart protects the heart against myocardial IR injury by its role in regulating energy metabolism. These studies will provide novel insights into how to manipulate energy metabolism to protect the heart from myocardial IR injury. Furthermore, these new fundamental scientific findings will have broader implications in diseases related to other organs and tissues.',\n",

Degeneration occurs in photoreceptor cells, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and in the choroidal vasculature, a complex of tightly interdependent tissues in the posterior eye. This project will investigate in vivo the photoreceptor-RPE-choroid complex in animal models of two macular degenerations, RPE mitochondrial dysfunction model and Doyne Honeycomb Retinal Dystrophy. These models recapitulate two major hallmarks of inherited and age related macular degeneration, degeneration of RPE cells, and age- related increase in extracellular deposits between the RPE and Bruch's membrane, which separates the RPE from the choroidal capillary bed. The project will use innovative, cellular-level resolution in vivo imaging combined with additional functional tests to characterize age-related changes in the structure and function of cells of the photoreceptor-RPE-choroid neurovascular unit (PRC-NVU). These studies will be performed longitudinally in cohorts of mice with the genetic defects, and in wild type controls. The studies will test the hypothesis that the primary defects in RPE-Bruch's membrane cause secondary deterioration of photoreceptors and choriocapillaris vasculature. The studies include measures of photoreceptor structure and electrical activity, bleaching and regeneration of the rod visual pigment rhodopsin, mapping of Bruch's membrane thickness, RPE cell autofluorescence, the redox status of RPE cells, and choriocapillaris vascular morphology and flow. At the termination of the study, the choroid-RPE from one eye of each mouse will be imaged with high resolution ex vivo confocal microscopy; the retina from the second eye of each mouse will be evaluated by conventional histological and biochemical measurements performed on light or electron microscopes, to allow validation of in vivo findings. A novel method for delivering drugs to the RPE via near infrared light-degradable nanoparticles will be used to locally target therapeutic agents to ailing RPE cells, and spatially resolved imaging will be used to determine if the therapeutic agents slow and stop disease progression. By combining longitudinal, in vivo imaging and optical nanotherapies, these studies will lay a foundation for locally targeted drug delivery in human ocular disease.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects 5.2 million Americans and over 75% of AF patients are 65 years or older. Weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. Older AF patients are at highest risk for stroke and major bleeding, often curtailing prescription of AC. Therapy for AF has also become more complex in recent years with the introduction of target specific oral anticoagulants beyond warfarin. In the proposed Systematic Assessment of Geriatric Elements in Atrial Fibrillation (SAGE-AF) study, our overall objective is to enhance AC decision-making in older patients with AF by assessing previously neglected information that is part of a geriatric assessment (e.g., cognitive function, fall risk) and identifying its key elements amenable to administration in the clinic and associated with important AC outcomes (e.g., bleeding, time in therapeutic range [TTR], patient-reported AC satisfaction). We will conduct geriatric assessments every 6 months for 2 years in a diverse sample of 1,200 older AF patients at high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc?2) recruited from 5 ambulatory clinics in Central MA and GA. The specific Aims of the proposed project are: 1. Relate components of a geriatric assessment, based on validated measures of psychosocial and cognitive function and frailty, to use and type of AC, and compare how elements of the geriatric assessment change over time in AC users and non-users. 2. Among AF patients receiving AC, relate geriatric assessment measures at baseline to indicators of successful AC (e.g., bleeding, TTR, and patient satisfaction), 3. Among AF patients receiving AC, relate change in geriatric assessment measures to indicators of successful AC (bleeding, TTR and patient satisfaction) and evaluate whether this association varies by AC type. Our findings will contribute important information on novel and parsimonious risk stratifiers for optimal anticoagulation and clinical and quality of life outcomes in older patients with AF. We will also disseminate our results in a novel and user-friendly was by preparing a concise, easy to use geriatric AF resource based on our results that is comprised of key geriatric elements, all of which will be freely available in the public domain, and instructions for administration and interpretation. This Geriatric AF Resource will accelerate the uptake of our findings and enhance the clinical impact of SAGE-AF.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a potent human carcinogen found in the workplace of more than 0.5 million individuals in the US. Environmental exposure to Cr(VI) also represents a significant public health concern due to the presence of this metal in drinking water for millions of US households and at many Superfund toxic sites. Intracellular reduction of Cr(VI) results in the formation of a wide assortment of DNA lesions, including several forms of Cr-DNA adducts. We have previously found that Cr-DNA binding was responsible for all mutagenic and genotoxic effects generated by direct metabolism of Cr(VI) with its main biological reducers. The genotoxicity of Cr-DNA adducts was unexpected considering their very weak duplex-distorting properties reflecting attachment of Cr atom to the DNA phosphate group. Cr(VI) also causes very toxic, cancer-promoting DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) that is detectable at environmentally relevant Cr(VI) doses and poorly repaired. This application, which is built on our previously published findings and new preliminary data, is designed to investigate a mechanism of DSB formation via toxic DNA repair of Cr-DNA adducts. The proposed studies aim to identify specific forms of Cr-DNA damage that trigger toxic DNA repair and DSB formation, characterize nuclease activities involved in DNA strand cleavage and determine genomic host-spots for DNA breakage and DNA repair processes. A successful completion of this work can help identify toxicologically important biomarkers of Cr(VI) exposure and high-risk genomic sites that can be used for monitoring of genetic damage in exposed populations.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.',\n",

       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lymphatic vessels serve an essential function in maintaining interstitial fluid balance throughout the body. They also serve as a conduit for the trafficking and maturation of immune cells. Functional disruption of lymphatic vessels by either surgery, radiation/chemotherapy or organ damage results in pathological lymphedema and subsequent interstitial fibrous deposition and inflammation. The heart contains a dense network of lymphatic vessels that exhibit coordinated flow with each contraction of the myocardium. However, whether lymphatic dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiological progression of heart injury following myocardial ischemia remains unknown. Furthermore, we lack a full understanding of the consequences of myocardial edema on heart function following ischemic heart disease. Therefore the overall goal of this research proposal is to develop sophisticated surgical and genetic mouse model tools to address the function and modulation of cardiac lymphatic vessels in heart disease. Based on our expertise in lymphatic vessel biology and our interest in the cardioprotective functions of adrenomedullin peptide, we feel that we are uniquely well- positioned to address the effects of either increased cardiac lymphatics or lymphatic insufficiency on the resolution or exacerbation of myocardial edema, respectively. Results from our studies will provide conceptually novel insights into the largely unexplored role of cardiac lymphatic vessels in myocardial edema.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD) are the 15th most common cause of death in the U.S. They are frequently inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, with the defective gene products including smooth muscle contractile proteins (e.g., MYH11), extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and TGF-? signaling components; loss of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the aortic media characterizes the disease. We recently identified a single gain-of-function mutation (R177Q) in protein kinase G1 (PKG1) as the cause of TAAD in families with early dissections; the mutation causes constitutive, cGMP-independent enzyme activation. We generated mice carrying the R177Q knock-in mutation (PKG1RQ), which are normotensive and have no overt phenotype up to 4 months of age; however, pressure overload by trans-aortic constriction (TAC) caused excessive mortality with aortic rupture and abnormal aortic and cardiac remodeling. Determining how sustained PKG1 activation affects aortic integrity is of broader clinical relevance, because case reports suggest that repeated use of the PKG-stimulating drug sildenafil (Viagra) can lead to TAAD, and treating mice with a MYH11 mutation with sildenafil increased development of TAAD under hypertensive stress. We found increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tissue markers of oxidative damage, excess TGF-? signaling, and altered contractile and ECM-related gene expression in SMCs and aortas of PKG1RQ-mutant compared to wild type mice. We hypothesize that excess PKG1 activity leads to increased oxidative stress and dysregulation of gene expression in SMCs, resulting in impaired aortic wall maintenance/repair, and that reducing ROS production may protect PKG1RQ-mutant mice from aortic aneurysms. In Aim I, we will determine if hetero- and homozygous PKG1RQ mice develop aortic dilation and dissection spontaneously with age, or only under hypertensive stress, and examine the effect of pharmacological PKG activation on aortic wall integrity in wild type and heterozygous PKG1RQ mice. In Aim II, we will compare ROS production by mitochondria, NOX isoforms, and uncoupled NO synthases in wild type and PKG1RQ SMCs and tissues. To determine if excess ROS production is causally linked to aortic pathology, we will treat PKG1RQ mice with cobinamide, a vitamin B12 analog that is a novel ROS neutralizing agent, or cross them with NOX4-deficient mice and mice over- expressing mitochondrial superoxide dismutase or catalase. In Aim III, we will use RNA-seq and gene network analysis to compare a PKG1-induced gene signature in the aorta from wild type and PKG1RQ mice and from patients carrying the PKG1 mutation. We will analyze gene networks known to be involved in TAAD pathogenesis and determine ROS-induced transcriptome alterations. In Aim IV, we will determine the molecular basis of PKG1 activation by the R?Q mutation using deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry. Since PKG1 is the pharmacological target of multiple, clinically-used drugs, a better understanding of the effects of long-term PKG activation and excess ROS on aortic wall integrity is important. The potent ROS- neutralizing agent cobinamide is a promising new agent for anti-oxidant therapy in vascular diseases.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary Latinos in the United States face health disparities for obesity and related medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Targeting families to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors has been identified as an effective strategy to prevent obesity. With the importance of familism (family cohesion) among Latino population, a family based intervention is especially desirable as an engaging strategy to promote behaviors that support a healthy weight status and decrease obesity related health disparities for Latinos. Emerging evidence supports the need to include and target fathers in family based lifestyle behavior interventions. However, to date primarily mothers have been reached by such efforts in the US. Health Dads Healthy Kids (HDHK) is an evidence based program developed in Australia, shown to have significant weight and behavior treatment effects for fathers and their children, compared to controls. The HDHK program is based on Social Cognitive Theory and Family Systems Theory and aims to promote increased physical activity and improved dietary intake. An important innovation in the program is that fathers and children attend together and are both targeted as agents of behavior change for each other (reciprocal reinforcement) and to participate in fun, family activities together. HDHK has several features that may appeal to Latino families: it is delivered in group sessions by a trained facilitator from the community (collectivism), and it promotes paternal role- modeling (enforces respeto), family cohesion, and engagement together in lifestyle behaviors (familism). How- ever, HDHK should be systematically culturally adapted for Latino families to ensure appropriate enrollment, engagement and promotion of desired health outcomes for Latino families, prior to further evaluation. We propose to convene a panel of Latino fathers and mothers from the community to serve as key informants; and an expert panel of researchers with experience in culturally adapting parenting interventions for Latinos, Latino lifestyle behaviors, and the influence of Latino fathers. The two panels will work with the study team (including the developer of HDHK) to systematically modify the HDHK program to culturally adapt it for Latino families following the Ecological Validity Model. They will also inform the selection of items from established item banks of food and physical activity parenting. The resulting scales will be tested among a sample of Latino fathers to establish validated scales of parenting for Latino fathers, which is expected to be a mediator of children's behavior change in HDHK, and will be needed in the future trial. The resulting Latino-HDHK will be tested for feasibility (as measured by retention, engagement, and satisfaction), in a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=40). The pilot study will include a thorough process evaluation, including exit interviews with participating Latino fathers and their co-parent (typically mothers). Once completed, this developmental study will position us to apply for a future R01 to assess the Latino-HDHK in a fully powered randomized controlled trial.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We employ a progressive stepwise method of selecting and training young investigators. This stepwise training method permits screening of candidates at multiple levels and ensures that we invest in the most highly qualified and motivated individuals. In this application, we propose to develop a new program to extend our training to achieve a critical mass of researchers in Bolivia, where we are beginning to build local expertise. The proximity of Bolivia to Peru provides us with a unique opportunity to leverage the human capacity and infrastructure that we have built in Peru over the last 20 years, using a South-South training approach to more cost-effectively begin to build a scientific research community in Bolivia. There are several infectious diseases affecting public health in Bolivia, and we plan to focus our training on a few of the most important to the country: Chagas disease, cysticercosis, tuberculosis (TB), pneumonia, and HIV neurological co-infections. Over the past 25 years, we have developed a training network of developing and developed country institutions that is remarkable for its breadth, depth and sustainability. This program began with a focus on Peru, and has trained more than 90 Peruvian graduate and post-graduate students and 400 students of other nationalities, and the collaborative network of individuals and institutions tied to this grant has produced more than 350 original research articles in peer-reviewed journals. This network and infrastructure developed in our original program in Peru will be leveraged in the new proposed program to train researchers in Bolivia. We have the following steps in our program that will be completed under this D43 grant: Step 1. We will train 20+ students each year in infectious disease and research methods seminars in Bolivia, for a total of 100+ students during the 5 year grant. Step 2. We will train five students per year in laboratory rotations in Bolivia, for a total of 25 trainees during the 5 year grant. Step 3. We wil train two students per year in laboratory rotations at the UPCH, for a total of 10 trainees during the 5 year grant. Step 4. We will train two Bolivian students per year in a Master's degree program at UPCH, for a total of ten trainees during the five year grant. Step 5. We will support six Bolivian students to attend the Tropical Medicine and Public Health Summer Institute at JHSPH during the five year grant.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY . Mitochondria play a pivotal role in regulating cardiac function in health and disease by regulating energy balance, biosynthetic processes, and cellular survival. Mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis are maintained in part through fusion and fission of mitochondria as well as through autophagic clearance or mitophagy of damaged mitochondria. Disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis has been closely linked to a host of acquired and genetic disease states, characterized by cardiomyocyte death at the cell level and overt cardiac dysfunction at a systemic level. Thus, clearly a thorough understanding of the molecular regulators of mitochondrial homeostasis in the heart is critical for reducing cardiac dysfunction related mortality. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase, Mulan, is a novel regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in mammalian hearts. Mulan participates in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and function. While Parkin, a cytoplasmic E3 ligase, has been extensively studied in mitophagy, Mulan's proposed role as a mitochondrial injury sensor, mediator of mitophagy, and inducer of cell death is both novel and a significant departure from the current state of understanding in the field. Given that Mulan is upregulated in Parkin null mouse hearts, we postulate that Mulan's upregulation may serve to compensate for the loss of Parkin, thus maintaining the basal cardiac function of Parkin null mice. Employing state-of-the-art techniques, we will investigate the intricacies of protein-protein and protein-substrate interactions by Mulan as well as how modulation of Mulan's expression fundamentally alters mitochondrial dynamics. Ultimately, our data may provide the first glimpse of an unrecognized, yet significant role of Mulan as a ?resident mitochondrial injury-sensor? in the heart. Furthermore, we intend to define the distinct contribution of Mulan in mitophagy, that is independent from Parkin, as well as Mulan's role in mitochondrial function, dynamics, and cell death in the heart. Given the emerging importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac pathology, the findings from our proposal will help define the role of Mulan as a key mitochondrial injury-sensor. In addition, the proposed studies will have broad implications for the understanding and treatment of heart disease.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease: a novel developmental oligodendrogliopathy Huntington's disease (HD) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder that typically presents with progressive cognitive/motor deficits. Although HD exhibits a unitary genetic basis (mutant huntingtin [mHtt]), our understanding of HD pathogenesis remains poorly defined. The hallmark of HD is degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Therefore, study of HD has focused predominantly on cell autonomous mechanisms mediating MSN death. However, there is increasing recognition that HD pathology also encompasses dysfunction of oligodendrocytes (OLs), myelin and white matter tracts (WMTs). These defects occur during prodromal phases of HD, suggesting that non-cell autonomous mechanisms mediated by OLs may play important roles in HD pathogenesis. Here, we test the hypothesis that postnatal WMT abnormalities are: (1) secondary to defects in the second wave of developmental forebrain oligodendrogliogenesis leading to ectopic persistence of non-myelinating OLs from the first wave, and (2) necessary for region-specific profiles of forebrain vulnerability to neurodegeneration. This developmental hypothesis is based on our experimental data showing: (1) impairments in multiple NSC-mediated MSN developmental parameters in a HD knock-in mouse model, (2) early and stable OL impairments in HD mouse models/human pathological specimens, (3) key conjoint roles of Gsx2 in mediating MSN and OL second wave developmental functions, and (4) selective temporal ablation of mHtt after neural development recapitulates characteristic features of HD (EUREKA R01). Our Specific Aims are to define: (1) roles of ventrally- vs. dorsally-derived developmental OLs in HD WMT abnormalities, (2) pathogenic roles of OLs and WMT abnormalities in HD pathogenesis and therapeutic benefits of OL-based molecular genetic and cell replacement interventions. Our research approach will study: (I) differential ontogenic expression of Gsx2 in HD, (II) dynamic OL-specific lineage aberrations in HD, (III) molecular genetic rescue of Gsx2-dependent OL deficits in HD, (IV) role of HD-associated OL abnormalities in HD pathogenesis via conditional ablation of mHtt in OL precursors, (V) effects on HD onset/progression of OL cell replacement strategies. The Significance includes: (A) defining the developmental nature of HD OL lineage abnormalities, (B) establishing that a non-neuronal/non-cell autonomous mechanism is part of the pathogenic cascade leading to neuronal cell death, (C) establishing that HD represents a new class of primary developmental oligodendrogliopathy, (D) initiating entirely new directions for gene and cell based therapeutic studies during the prodromal phase based upon the HD-mediated OL developmental dysfunction. The Innovation is (1) proposing a novel mechanism underlying HD pathogenesis by incorporating a two-hit model including developmental forebrain OL deficits, (2) employing OL lineage-tracing to study the HD developmental oligodendrogliopathy, (3) using time-specific conditional genetic manipulations to rescue the putative HD developmental oligodendrogliopathy, (4) using cell replacement of OL developmental species to treat HD.\",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT  The goals of this Coordinating Center include facilitating information exchange among investigators in the NCI Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Consortium, supporting data integration and data analysis, and serving as a central resource for characterization and distribution of model systems. The leadership of this Center consists of a trio of investigators with deep and long-standing research programs focused on SCLC, with complementary strengths and experience. Charles Rudin, an experienced laboratory and clinical researcher focused on SCLC, who has directed two of the largest lung cancer research programs in the country over the past 13 years, serves as the overall PI of the Center, providing administrative leadership and coordination. John Minna and Tyler Jacks serve as co-leaders of the Center. Dr. Minna has consistently and repeatedly led discovery efforts defining SCLC biology over several decades, and together with his collaborators established nearly all of the SCLC cell lines that have served as the basis for SCLC preclinical research. Dr. Jacks has extensive experience in the development and characterization of innovative genetically engineered mouse models of SCLC and over the past decades has served as the primary mentor of many of the active investigators around the world working on mouse models of SCLC. We bring together additional key investigators and unqiue resources that we believe substantially add to the strengths of the Center. Yu Shir at Vanderbilt has established and directs HIPAA-compliant databases used by several multi- investigator consortia. Nikolaus Schultz?s team developed the cBioPortal and continues to expand and improve this leading platform for analysis and integration of complex ?omic level data, supporting many multi- investigator consortia worldwide. Adi Gazdar oversees the cell line resource at UT Southwestern, and will support distribution of these lines to U01 SCLC investigators. Anna Farago and Jeff Engelman at MGH, together with John Poirier and Dr. Rudin at MSK, have established substantial resources of SCLC patient- derived xenografts (PDX) and circulating tumor cell-derived xenografts (CDX) models, which are available for distribution among consortium members. Scott Lowe and Andrea Ventura offer highly innovative genetically engineered mouse modeling by CRISPR/Cas9 modulation of embryonic stem cells to rapidly assess genetic contributors to SCLC biology. Afshin Dowlati at Case Western will contribute a large collection of clinically annotated SCLC tissue microarrays representing chemosensitive as well as primary and secondary chemoresistant disease. Together we represent an exceptional team, led by three of the most widely recognized and established investigators in SCLC discovery research, with complementary strengths in therapeutic translation, basic biology, and animal modeling. By providing the resources above, and by coordinating frequent data-sharing opportunities and leading annual face-to-face meetings among SCLC investigators, we believe this Center can substantially accellerate progress against this deadly disease.',\n",
       " \"Abstract Myopia (near-sightedness) refers to the ocular condition in which there is a mismatch between the eye's optical power and its length, typically the product of increased scleral remodeling and eye elongation during childhood and/or adolescence, and leading to blurred distance vision. Myopia is associated with increased risk of potentially blinding pathologies, including glaucoma, maculopathies and retinal detachments, with risks increasing with the level of myopia. Myopia is now one of the leading causes of acquired blindness worldwide. Interestingly, a number of epidemiological studies have reported myopia to be more common among females who also show faster progression of the disease, while realizing poorer clinical outcomes. Traditionally, these apparent sex-specific differences have been attributed to behavioral differences, with little supportive scientific evidence. However, associations between myopia and growth spurts and early menarche as well as accelerated progression around puberty have also been reported. The project described here is based on the hypothesis that the observed sex-related bias in myopia reflects, at least in part, sex-specific, endocrine-related influences on the sclera, as has been observed in other connective tissues in the body. The over-riding goal of proposed research is understand the role and related mechanisms for endocrine regulation of scleral and thus eye growth. Unpublished pilot data has confirmed the expression of key class III sex hormone receptors in the sclera of young chicks, which will be used as our myopia model. Under Aim 1, we will profile scleral sex hormone receptors and related enzymes during development in young normal chicks, age-matched chicks induced to undergo precocious puberty and chicks reaching puberty naturally (validation step). Age-related changes in circulating levels of key sex hormones will also be measured. Experiments will investigate how expression of scleral sex hormone receptors and related enzymes vary, at both the gene and protein levels, with age and the onset of puberty, with sex being an over- riding variable. Local scleral and systemic levels of key ligands and enzymes will also be assessed. Precocious puberty will be induced using systemic tamoxifen. This approach takes into account practical and time constraints of an R21 grant. Under Aim 2, we will determine how transcriptional and translational levels of sex hormone receptors and enzymes, as well as local scleral sex hormone levels, change during myopia development in tamoxifen-treated compared to normal chicks. In experiments under both Aims, RT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses will be undertaken to examine gene and protein expression and LC-MS/MS used to assess local scleral and systemic levels of key ligands. An improved understanding of the link between sex and myopia prevalence and severity has potentially broad implications related to environmental endocrine disruptors and the timing of school vision screening programs, as well as for the individual patient, customization of clinical intervention strategies for myopia control.\",\n",
       " \"Project Summary Malaria affects almost one-half of the world's population and causes more than 500,000 deaths annually. Young children in malaria endemic areas of Africa have the highest mortality rate because of their immature immune systems. Global efforts to control the disease have had limited success, and no vaccine has yet been approved for clinical use. Therefore, there is an urgent, unmet need to discover new vaccine candidates. A vaccine against childhood malaria is a priority because children below the age of 5 years are highly vulnerable to the disease. In recent studies, our laboratory discovered Schizont Egress Antigen-1 (PfSEA-1), a 244-kDa- parasite antigen that is crucial for parasite egress from an infected red blood cell (iRBC), which was published as a comprehensive, full-length Research Article in Science. In a parallel approach, we have screened a phage display cDNA library constructed from parasites isolated at our Tanzanian field site using positive selection with antibodies pooled from resistant two-year-olds and negative selection with antibodies pooled from susceptible children. We identified several independent cDNA clones encoding plant-like calcium-dependent protein kinase (PfCDPK5) that were uniquely recognized by antibodies in resistant, but not susceptible sera. Our preliminary data demonstrate that PfCDPK5 is critical for parasite egress and is expressed by merozoites as they rupture from erythrocytes. Antibodies against CDPK5 block parasite growth in vitro, protect mice from parasitemia, and extend the survival of mice challenged with lethal P. berghei ANKA. Furthermore, PfCDPK5 interacts with other proteins (PfSEA) involved in parasite egress. The proposed work will evaluate the association between naturally acquired anti-PfCDPK5 antibody responses and protection from malaria infection and disease. We will also evaluate the in vivo efficacy of vaccination with rPbCDPK5 in mice and conduct initial optimization studies of adjuvant-antigen formulation using both soluble and particulate forms of the antigen. These studies will form the core supporting data for follow-on vaccine trials in non-human primates with the ultimate goal of a malaria vaccine for humans.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an especially virulent form of lung cancer that is only transiently responsive to therapy and kills about 30,000 Americans each year. Based on a more general interest in understanding why certain kinds of cancers have characteristic genotypes, we are developing methods for studying the initiation of human cancers by genetically modifying cells at discrete stages of differentiation after chemical induction of specific lineages from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We have extended recently published methods for inducing hESCs to form parts of the pulmonary lineage by perturbing NOTCH signaling and reducing expression of the RB1 gene (one of the two genes commonly inactivated in SCLC); in this way, we have prepared cultures with high proportions of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), the putative precursors of SCLC. Moreover, by also reducing expression of P53, the other gene commonly inactivated in SCLC, PNEC-containing cultures are able to produce small tumors resembling SCLC when implanted in immune-deficient mice.  We now propose to expand our studies of this promising model for studying the origins of SCLC in several ways: by determining the mechanisms by which interference with NOTCH and RB1 generates PNECs; by exploring several possible assays for the SCLC-like phenotype we have recently observed; by defining the similarities between the genetic and physiological features of the SCLCs derived from hESCs and the SCLCs arising in human patients; and by making induced pleuropotent stem cells (iPSCs) from normal and tumor cells from patients with lung cancer, especially SCLC, in an effort to seek genetic risk factors for SCLC. Through these studies, we expect to generate new information and ideas about risk assessment, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for SCLC. !',\n",
       " \"The Phylodynamics-targeted Partner service Models (P2M) project aims to guide and transform the rapidly evolving public health implementation of molecular HIV surveillance (MHS) based prevention interventions as a critical step towards HIV elimination. P2M seeks to study and optimize emerging new national guidance: The CDC's March 2017 recommendations of the HIV Cluster Guidance Working Group on health department implementation of MHS with clinical HIV resistance genotypes, now recommended at entry to care. These HIV-1 pol sequences can be used to identify ?molecular clusters? of persons with genetically similar HIV. The overarching goal of MHS is to identify persons within the risk environment. These persons are potential sources, or recipients, of new HIV transmissions, and defined as: 1) new HIV seropositives (including recent/acute infections); 2) previously known HIV seropositives with detectable viral load (in care or not); and 3) at-risk HIV seronegatives. The yield of these persons in the risk environment is an important metric of the usefulness of MHS-based partner services or other network recruitment procedures (ie 2-step) that will be examined in P2M. Thus, P2M aims to rigorously test the hypotheses that: (a) analyzing molecular cluster data closer to time of HIV diagnosis will increase the yield of risk environment members; and (b) targeted prevention using advanced partner and network service approaches our team has innovated will also increase yield and improve effectiveness of public health combination interventions. It is not feasible, however, to conduct a series of randomized trials to test these hypotheses. Modeling approaches, however, are best suited for providing guidance when multiple approaches and conceivable conditions exist, the contexts do not lend themselves to research trials, and where multiple downstream outcomes are possible. For P2M, members of this multi- institutional investigative team (from Houston and Chicago) will build upon existing HIV TRACE collaborations, observational cohorts of populations most impacted by HIV and an existing Agent-Based HIV transmission model (ABM) to guide and prioritize interventions. Accordingly, we aim to: Aim 1) Determine the relative effectiveness of partner services targeted to HIV TRACE derived molecular clusters compared to partner services as currently delivered without molecular cluster targeting (standard of care) to yield persons in the risk environment. Aim 2) Optimize several cluster size and time thresholds by parameterizing an agent-based model with existing cohort data that best yield categories of individuals in the risk environment based upon: 1) time-to-molecular cluster identification; 2) molecular cluster number and size; and 3) real-time versus delayed partner services response to cluster growth. Aim 3a) Model relative effectiveness of combined molecular surveillance and next-generation partner services ? 2-step, 3-step and social network referral ? that best yield persons in the risk environment; Aim 3b) Explore simulated HIV prevention interventions (ie. PrEP) and their cost as they are modeled within real-world molecular cluster and partner/network service strategies.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract: ?Bayesian image analysis in Fourier space (BIFS)?  The objective of this grant is to develop a family of new medical imaging processing methods that will advance the state-of-the art in radiological research and diagnostic evaluation. We will improve on commonly used spatial filtering methods, Fourier/wavelet shrinkage/sparsity methods, and conventional Bayesian image analysis methods by reformulating Bayesian Image analysis in Fourier Space (BIFS), i.e., by modeling in terms of spatial frequencies. Spatially correlated prior distributions that are difficult to model and compute in conventional image space can be more efficiently modeled as a set of independent processes across Fourier space. The originally inter-correlated and high-dimensional problem in image space is thereby broken down into a series of independent one-dimensional problems in Fourier space, where the independent distributions are tied together by our development of a parameter function over Fourier space. This independence over Fourier space structure coupled with the concept of the parameter function will enable us to develop new families of powerful and easy to specify BIFS models with fast algorithms to compute posterior image estimates. We will disseminate these methods to imaging researchers and clinical practitioners by developing a BIFS software package designed to solve a wide range of medical image processing problems.  The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) to develop novel BIFS models targeted to provide improved solutions to medical image processing problems; 2) to validate benefits of BIFS models compared with conventional processing methods based on careful simulation and phantom imaging studies; 3) to clinically validate improvements generated by BIFS modeling in two ongoing clinical studies: a) quantification of brain perfusion patterns associated with frontotemporal lobar dementia, and b) detection of breast cancer in MRIs; and 4) to disseminate the methods to the wider clinical and scientific communities by generating and releasing an R package for the implementation of BIFS.  Our innovative BIFS modeling approach has the potential to make a big difference in the field of medical image processing problems and image analysis in general. The impact on radiological application through the development of new, readily implementable and fast-to-compute BIFS models will lead to increased accuracy for the detection of findings in radiological screening and diagnosis; improved assessment of treatment efficacy; increased accuracy for measuring disease effects in imaging-based clinical studies; and expanded potential for practical image data-mining.',\n",
       " 'Nucleotide excision repair (NER) protects human cells by removing harmful DNA adducts formed by environmental toxins and solar UV irradiation. Defects in NER in humans lead to the DNA repair disorder xeroderma pigmentosum, which is characterized by high predisposition to skin cancer, neurological abnormalities and premature death. The repair of damaged DNA by NER also has a downside ? it contributes significantly to the development of resistance of tumors to treatment with antitumor agents, in particular cis- and carboplatin, two of the most widely prescribed drugs in oncology. We propose to leverage the combined expertise of the Scharer and Chazin laboratories in chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, structural biology, and small molecule discovery to elucidate how the scaffold protein XPA coordinates the assembly and organization of NER incision complexes. Despite its modest size (273 residues), XPA functions as the central scaffold of NER complexes, interacting with 4 key NER proteins as well as DNA. However, how XPA is recruited to the site of damage and positions other factors through its various interactions remains poorly understood. Moreover, given its essential role in organizing and orchestrating the trajectory of NER complexes, XPA is an attractive potential Achilles Heel to target for suppressing NER. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that TFIIH recruits XPA to sites of UV damage through a proposed interaction interface involving the C-terminal region of XPA and the p8 subunit of TFIIH. We will biochemically and structurally characterize this interaction and determine how mutations in the interface that disturb this interaction affect NER in vitro and in vivo. Abolishing the interaction between XPA and TFIIH will also address the long-standing question of whether the steps following damage recognition are the same for global genome and transcription-coupled NER ? the arrival of TFIIH and XPA is the first step common to both pathways. The action of TFIIH on damaged DNA creates an open ?NER bubble? that provides a landing platform for XPA and RPA and is required for NER incision. The scaffolding function of XPA is reliant on its coordination with RPA, which binds the undamaged strand. Aim 2 will determine the molecular basis and functional implications of the coordinated action of XPA and RPA. Structural, biochemical, and biophysical approaches combined with cellular assays will test the hypothesis that the two interaction sites between XPA and RPA are simultaneously engaged and contribute to NER in a cooperative fashion. Based on these results, our expertise in fragment based molecular discovery will be used to develop and validate initial inhibitors targeting XPA-RPA interfaces. These studies are expected to provide: (i) dramatic new mechanistic insights into the central role of XPA in assembling and coordinating the NER machinery; (ii) the identity of XPA interaction surfaces that are critical to NER; (iii) proof of principle that interfaces between XPA and other NER factors are suitable targets for evaluating the potential of overcoming tumor resistance to DNA damaging therapies by suppressing NER.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed project aims to use genetics to help develop an approach for classifying severe mental illness (SMI) that has a stronger scientific foundation than the systems currently used in both research and clinical practice. These classification systems have, for more than a century, divided the bulk of SMI into dichotomous diagnostic categories: psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia [SCZ]) and mood disorders (including bipolar disorder [BP] and major depressive disorder [MDD]). However the overlap of symptomatology across mood and psychotic disorders, and growing evidence for the genetic correlation between these categories, demonstrate that they imprecisely represent the biological underpinning of SMI. It has been proposed that frameworks based on symptom-level and dimensional (quantitative) information, such as the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), would better reflect the genetic contribution to SMI and would therefore provide a more useful framework for their classification. However the evidence supporting this hypothesis remains sparse, in large part because we lack the right datasets to test it. In this project we will generate a unique SMI dataset, using electronic health records to ascertain individuals who have received inpatient treatment at a single psychiatric hospital that serves the entire 1 million inhabitants of the state of Caldas, Colombia. All of the individuals whom we will investigate are members of the ?Paisa?, a genetically and culturally homogeneous population that comprises the majority in this region of Colombia. By recruiting 8,000 participants across the full range of severe mood and psychotic disorders (as well as 2,000 demographically-matched controls); performing uniform phenotyping of these 10,000 individuals using diagnostic and quantitative assessments; and genome wide genotyping, we will establish dimensional phenotypes that index core deficits of SMI and that reference multiple RDoC domains. We will then conduct genetic analyses of symptom-level and quantitative phenotypes, evaluating their relationship to known SMI loci and to polygenic risk scores (PRS) that represent the overall contribution of common genetic variation to these disorders; the SCZ, BP, and MDD workgroups of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) will provide us with up-to-date genetic data for each diagnosis. Additionally, we will conduct genome wide association analyses of the quantitative traits, including meta-analyses for traits that have been assessed in other study populations. We will also contribute our data (including genotypes available to us for an additional 6,000 Paisa controls) to the case-control meta-analyses of the PGC workgroups, contributing to the diversity of their datasets by adding a substantial number of samples from a previously underrepresented (Hispanic) population. .',\n",
       " 'Summary The long-term goal of this research project is to understand cellular, molecular, and epigenetic mechanisms of endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling that may modulate synaptic and neurocognitive functions. While the eCB system is known to play an important role in regulation of brain homeostasis, accumulated information suggests that the eCB system is also involved in several mental and neurological disorders. Augmentation of eCB signaling by inhibition of eCB metabolism has been proposed as a promising therapy for treatment and prevention of mental and neurocognitive illnesses. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying augmentation of eCB signaling by chronic inhibition of eCB metabolism in synaptic activity is still limited. Strengthening endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) signaling by chronic inactivation of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the primary enzyme that hydrolyzes 2-AG in the brain, has been shown to produce antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects and enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory. Our recent studies showed that sustained inactivation of MAGL increases the density of dendritic spines and expression of glutamate receptor subunits in the hippocampus. This suggests that augmentation of 2-AG signaling by inhibition of MAGL regulates structural and functional plasticity of synapses that determine activity of neural circuits and corresponding neurocognitive functions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate expression and function of target molecules. However, we do not know whether miRNAs that target molecules involved in maintaining the integrity of synaptic structure and function are regulated by eCB signaling. In the proposed studies, we will test the hypothesis that regulation of synaptic activity and cognitive function by chronic inactivation of MAGL is through 2-AG signaling-mediated suppression of the miRNA that targets the molecules important for regulation of synaptic activity. The research proposed in this application is expected to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying augmentation of eCB signaling in regulation of synaptic and neurocognitive functions, which may lead to future research on improving strategies for the treatment and prevention of mental and neurological illnesses.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT  CD8 T cells are important contributors to the pathology observed in many autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes. Despite the importance of autoreactive CD8 T cells, much fundamental knowledge is lacking in several major areas, including i) the properties of class I MHC alleles that confer susceptibility or resistance to disease; ii) the determinants that underlie the promiscuous antigen recognition often displayed by autoreactive T cells; and iii) the contribution of the CD8?? co-receptor in facilitating autoimmune processes. These are the critical knowledge gaps that we seek to fill, and we will do so using a multidisciplinary approach and a collection of innovative strategies, reagents, and animal models. In Aim 1, we will define the biochemical and structural features and in vivo peptide presentation properties of human class I MHC alleles associated with susceptibility or resistance to type 1 diabetes. These studies will focus on HLA-B*39:06, B*39:01, and B*38:01, a closely related group of class I MHC alleles that are differentially associated with disease. We will test the hypothesis that the differential ability of these three alleles to mediate disease is the consequence of differential binding and presentation of certain disease-relevant beta cell peptides. Our newly developed NOD mouse models expressing human insulin or human IGRP will be central to this aim. In Aim 2, we will use the T cell receptors from a set of promiscuous and autoreactive CD8 T cell clones in structural and mutagenesis studies to define the mechanisms that underlie T cell receptor cross-reactivity. Among other approaches, we will take advantage of novel high-throughput assays that we have developed both to identify T cell epitopes and map protein binding interfaces. In Aim 3, we will use biochemical and biophysical approaches and in vivo models to better understand the interaction between CD8?? and peptide-MHC. Despite the requirement of CD8?? for CD8 T cell selection and peripheral activation, and its potential as a therapeutic target, crystallographic analysis of its interaction with pMHC is limited to a single structure of murine CD8?? with H-2Dd. Our own findings from mouse models we have recently characterized suggest that human CD8?? may be interacting with class I MHC in a manner not revealed by the single available structure. While autoreactive CD8 T cells under study here are likely to exhibit some unique features due to their necessity to escape tolerance mechanisms, much of what will be learned will be fundamental knowledge that is generally applicable to CD8 T cell biology and that will help guide the future development of more effective approaches to manipulate and harness the immune system in health and disease.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  A key mechanism for immune evasion and persistent infection by the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, is recombination at the vls locus. To date, the vls locus has not been receptive to direct mutation by any available methods. This fact has created the need for the development of a vls system that is amenable to genetic manipulation. Recently, our lab has generated a mini-vls plasmid construct with high potential to meet this demand. Development of this mini-vls system as a tool for mutational analysis will help bridge a fundamental gap in our understanding of the mechanism behind vlsE antigenic variation. Our long-term goals are to determine the mechanistic aspects of vlsE recombination, and to identify and characterize the unique B. burgdorferi proteins responsible for VlsE antigenic variation. The objective of this application is to identify the mechanistic determinants required for vls switching, and to establish the importance of the cis organization of the vls locus for efficient recombination. The central hypothesis is that that G-run DNA regions directly flanking the vlsE variable cassette, and the 51bp inverted repeat of the vls locus, act as mechanistic DNA elements that are essential for vlsE switching. Furthermore, we hypothesize that antigenic variation requires a cis organization of the locus. The rationale for the proposed research is that identifying key mechanistic elements and important structural components will ultimately provide critical clues to the proteins involved in vls recombination that is critical for persistent infection by the Lyme disease pathogen. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to that part of NIH?s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will potentially help to reduce the burdens of human illness and disability. Guided by preliminary data and cited work by other groups, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Identify the mechanistic determinants required for vls recombination; and 2) Establish the importance of the cis organization of the vls locus for efficient vlsE recombination. Under the first aim, mutations of the DNA inverted repeat and G-run regions within the vls locus will be generated and cloned into an lp28-1-deficient strain of B. burgdorferi using a unique mini-vls plasmid, and transformants will be used to infect both immunologically-competent and -deficient mice. Under the second aim, spirochetes harboring the vlsE gene and silent cassettes on two separate linear DNA molecules will be examined for vls switching after being passaged through a mouse host. The proposed work is innovative for two main reasons: 1) they entail cloning and genetic manipulation of the full vls locus using a unique mini-vls construct, and 2) they involve transformation of ligated DNA products directly into B. burgdorferi. When applied, the results from the proposed studies are expected to allow the targeting of this system in order to significantly reduce the ability of this pathogen to establish a persistent infection in the mammalian host.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY The Candidate, Michael E. Watson, M.D., Ph.D., is a faculty member (Assistant Professor) of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the University of Michigan. He completed a residency in Pediatrics and fellowship in Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Washington University where he began his research on the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes under the guidance of Michael Caparon, Ph.D., Professor of Microbiology. In July 2013 he was recruited to the University of Michigan and immediately appointed as a faculty scholar to the Child Health Research Center (CHRC) K12 Career Development Award which funded Dr. Watson for 3 years. The Immediate Goal of this K08 Award is to provide an additional 3 years of research experience protected from clinical and administrative duties (?75% research effort) in order to acquire further training in the investigation of bacterial pathogenesis related to colonization and infection at mucosal sites and the use of advanced genomic analysis methodology. The Long-Term Goal is to become an independent, extramurally-funded, pediatric physician-scientist. The Research Environment at the University of Michigan is exceptional and currently ranks 9th among all research-oriented medical schools according to the 2017 US News and World Report. The Candidate has developed a comprehensive Career Development Plan. Dr. Watson has recruited co-mentors including Harry L.T. Mobley, Ph.D., Professor of Microbiology, and Suzanne R. Dawid, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Microbiology. Dr. Mobley has a distinguished career of >30 years in microbial pathogenesis research and has previously mentored >33 fellows and junior faculty members. Dr. Dawid provides expertise in streptococcal bacterial pathogenesis and mucosal colonization. Dr. Watson has established a Scientific Advisory Subcommittee for technical expertise and a Career Advisory Subcommittee composed of senior clinician-scientists from Pediatrics who will help him navigate an academic medicine career. In addition, Dr. Caparon at Washington University will continue serving as an external advisor. Research Strategy: The Central Hypothesis is that S. pyogenes persister strains successfully evade host mucosal immunity by negatively regulating the expression of virulence factors or antigens necessary for the activation of cytokine IL-17A-mediated leukocyte recruitment. The Specific Aims are: 1) Identify and characterize host leukocyte populations necessary to promote streptococcal mucosal clearance; and 2) Characterize streptococcal persister strains in mucosal epithelial tissues. The proposed work is innovative, capitalizing on the use of a long-term, mucosal carriage murine model for S. pyogenes developed by the Candidate, combined with transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling to characterize streptococcal persister strains in vivo. The Rationale is that through this proposed work it may be possible to develop novel strategies to stimulate mucosal immunity, or specifically target the metabolic activities of long- term persister strains, to promote streptococcal eradication from the mucosal epithelial environment.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Thomas Hooven is a neonatologist and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Columbia University studying Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus; GBS), the major infectious cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. His research, under the mentorship of Dr. Adam Ratner, focuses on genes and gene networks that enable GBS to successfully colonize the maternal reproductive tract and to survive in amniotic fluid and blood during perinatal infection. Using a novel genome-wide screening technique based on next-generation sequencing of transposon-genome junctions from a saturated mutant library (Tn-seq), Dr. Hooven can accurately predict GBS genes whose protein products are necessary for bacterial growth under diverse experimental conditions. His proposed research seeks to use Tn-seq technology?in combination with ex vivo and in vivo models of colonization and invasion?to pinpoint surface-localized GBS proteins whose functions are essential for pathogenesis. Once validated by targeted knockout and antibody coincubation experiments, those proteins identified as essential for pathogenesis will be purified and tested as candidate vaccines to prevent vaginal colonization, ascending chorioamnionitis, and early-onset sepsis in clinically relevant mouse models. Recognizing that vaccine efficacy may depend on a combination of humoral and cellular immune mechanisms, this proposal also includes studies of opsonophagocytosis after antibody binding to candidate vaccine protein targets and T cell responses to immunization and vaginal colonization. By performing this research, Dr. Hooven will advance scientific understanding of GBS pathogenesis and bring society closer to a safe and effective vaccine to prevent devastating neonatal GBS infections. He will also expand his experimental repertoire through exposure to key methods in bioinformatics, immunology, molecular genetics, and vaccine development. This project will provide crucial training that will set the stage for his transition to becoming an independent investigator. Upon completion of the proposed research, Dr. Hooven will be ready to assume oversight of his own basic and translational research program aimed at advancing neonatal health through new insights into infection and new approaches toward its prevention and treatment.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary/Abstract  This mentored career development award (K08) proposal describes the research and educational plans for the candidate, Andrew Janowski MD. His long-term goal is to discover and characterize viral causes of central nervous system (CNS) infection. One entity, encephalitis, is often caused by infectious pathogens, but frequently an etiology cannot be identified despite extensive clinical testing. A subset of encephalitis cases are anticipated to be caused by novel viruses or viruses with an unappreciated neurotropism. Dr. Janowski has previously used next-generation sequencing technology to discover a novel family of viruses named statoviruses and has also increased the number of known RNA bacteriophages by over six-fold. He will apply these skills to identify novel pathogens in CNS infections and to characterize their biology.  Astrovirus VA1 (VA1), a virus originally discovered by Dr. Janowski's mentor, David Wang PhD, has been identified as an emerging cause of encephalitis. However, studies of the fundamental biology of this virus has been precluded by the lack of an experimental model of infection. Dr. Janowski has developed the first cell culture model of VA1 infection in vitro, and now the biology of VA1 infection can be elucidated using this system. In Aim 1, he will develop an in vitro model of VA1 CNS infection. He will define host expression profiles upon infection and determine if there are any VA1 strain specific cellular tropisms. The host immune response to VA1 infection is also poorly defined, but preliminary evidence suggests that interferon-? is induced by VA1 and addition of exogenous interferon reduces VA1 replication. For Aim 2, Dr. Janowski will use a CRISPR/Cas- 9 approach to define pattern recognition receptors and interferon stimulated genes that mediate the interferon response. In Aim 3, Dr. Janowski will use a neutralization assay to define the seroprevalence of neutralizing antibodies to VA1. He will also use a qRT-PCR assay to define the burden of CNS diseases caused by VA1, as he has a repository of clinical specimens from patients with acute CNS diseases.  Characterizing VA1 will prepare Dr. Janowski to transition as an independent physician-scientist by the end of the K08 award period. His career development will be overseen by his co-mentors, Drs. David Wang and Gregory Storch, with Drs. Robyn Klein, Herbert ?Skip? Virgin, Mike Diamond, and David Hunstad forming an illustrious advisory committee that will assist in career development and experimental design. In addition, Dr. Janowski will complete a master's degree in clinical investigation in translational medicine at Washington University in St Louis to enhance his formal scientific training. He has the support of a world-class institution, an outstanding group of mentors and advisors, a well-developed educational plan, and a research project that will provide unique and provocative results regarding the biology of VA1. The results of this K08 proposal will not only build upon host-virus interactions in CNS infections but it will launch the independent research career of Dr. Janowski.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Low- and middle-income countries are projected to have substantial increases in incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the same regions where tuberculosis (TB) is endemic and a public health priority. Diabetes increases the risk of TB disease by three times and an estimated 15% of incident TB cases are due to diabetes, similar to the proportion of TB cases attributable to HIV. In the context of increasing rates of co-occurring TB and diabetes, prevention efforts to reduce the burden of dual disease are severely limited by critical gaps in knowledge of the relationship between latent TB infection and risk of diabetes mellitus. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) determine the extent to which latent TB infection (measured by interferon-gamma release assay [IGRA]) increases the risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus; (2) determine if latent TB increases the risk of progression from normal blood glucose to pre-diabetes; and (3) determine the extent to which latent TB treatment decreases the risk of incident type 2 diabetes among patients with latent TB infection. The aims of this project will be achieved by building a large database of patients with known latent TB infection status who are at risk of developing diabetes. The study will use longitudinal data from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse from 2000-2015 to build a retrospective cohort of more than 100,000 patients. The analysis will include multiple modeling strategies and propensity scores to assess the relationship between latent TB infection and rate of incident diabetes. This research has the potential to have far-reaching implications for biomedical approaches to diabetes prevention and TB control. The proposed study includes an unprecedented hypothesis that challenges current assumptions and the paradigm that the observed association between active TB and diabetes is singularly due to increased susceptibility to TB among patients with diabetes. Existing epidemiologic data demonstrate a higher prevalence of diabetes in patients with active TB compared to the background population prevalence of diabetes. However, it is unknown if the increased prevalence of diabetes among patients with active TB is due to diabetes impacting 1) risk of latent infection, 2) risk of reactivation from latent TB to active disease, 3) risk for primary progression from Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure to active TB disease, 4) or alternatively, if TB infection or disease impacts the risk of diabetes incidence. The proposed study will help to clarify TB-diabetes pathways and will generate preliminary data useful to deconstruct the pathways which lead to increased diabetes prevalence among patients with active TB. The long term goal of the proposed work is to prepare for a prospective study to examine the relationship between TB infection and risk of diabetes and ultimately better characterize the effect of immune activity related to TB infection on metabolic function.',\n",
       " 'While the genomes of two people are >99% identical, the genetic differences encode amazing diversity in human traits and disease susceptibility. Understanding of the genetic architecture underlying human diversity in complex traits has been transformed by the application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, GWAS are just the first step in understanding how genetic variants contribute to disease risk by impacting genes that encode components of cellular physiology. Elucidating this chain of causality from SNP to gene to cell biology to disease can serve to not only functionally validate the genetic association with disease but also reveal potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, there is a need for approaches that can facilitate identification of the cellular pathways regulated by human genetic variants associated with disease. The objectives of this application are to systematically reveal the shared genetic architecture connecting cellular physiology and disease susceptibility and to develop a database to facilitate hypothesis generation from these data. The experimental and computational tools are in place to carry this out successfully. GWAS of molecular and cellular traits have been generated by our lab and acquired from publicly available datasets. An extensively validated cellular GWAS platform called Hi-HOST (High-throughput human in vitro susceptibility testing) uses pathogens to stimulate fundamental cellular pathways. Hi-HOST combines precise measurement of cellular phenotypes in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from nearly a thousand people with genome-wide association using 15 million genetic variants to identify genetic differences that underlie the phenotypic variation. With this platform, cellular responses of infectivity and replication, cytokine levels, and host cell death using 9 different pathogens have already been carried out and analyzed with family-based GWAS analysis on 148 cellular traits. Dozens of SNPs pass genome-wide significance have been incorporated into established workflows in the lab to validate their importance and determine mechanism. Additional datasets to expand our analyses beyond LCLs include metabolomics GWAS data from blood and urine and GWAS of immune cell levels. These molecular and cellular GWAS dataset will be integrated with human disease GWAS from the NHGRI/EMBL catalog. The central hypothesis is that the SNPs associated with each cellular phenotype and disease serve as a ?GWAS signature? that can be used to connect these different traits based on similarity and that the contribution of individual cellular traits to heritability of diseases can be estimated from comparing these signatures. Published methods developed by our own lab (CPAG (Cross-Phenotype Analysis of GWAS)), as well as by other investigators (LD-score regression) will be used to carry out these analyses. Thus, this project will integrate cellular and disease GWAS to create a re-interpretation of the human genome through the lens of cell biology. The project leverages existing datasets into a hypothesis generating engine for researchers looking to explore new diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT ? (Title: Dynamic Neural Mechanisms of Audiovisual Speech Perception) Natural speech perception is multisensory; when conversing with someone that we can see, our brains combine visual (V) information from face, postural and hand gestures with auditory (A) information from the voice. The underlying speech processing is extremely rapid, with incoming AV units (e.g., syllables) arriving every few hundred milliseconds that must be encoded and passed on before the next syllable arrives. Finally, this bottom-up sensory information is combined with a top-down cognitive component: what we perceive is strongly influenced by its context. Speech is fundamentally human, and thus, its brain mechanisms are usually studied with noninvasive fMRI, EEG and MEG. Because each method has critical limitations in spatial or temporal resolution, identifying the specific brain mechanisms of speech perception - AV integration, precise and rapid information encoding and top-down control - is a nearly intractable problem.  This three-year U01 project will sidestep the problem using direct recording of neuron ensemble (electrocorticographic or ECoG) activity and single neuron activity, along with direct stimulation of selected sites in the brains of surgical epilepsy patients as they process AV speech. Our collaborative ECoG team embodies expertise in multisensory integration and speech perception and leverages the skills and perspectives of neuroscientists, neurosurgeons, engineers, neuropsychologists, neurologists, and ethicists across three leading epilepsy centers: Columbia University Medical Center, Baylor College of Medicine and Northshore-Long Island Jewish Medical Center. By combining the expertise and patients available at all three centers, we will be able to tackle problems that are inaccessible to individual investigators.  Our overarching hypothesis, building on our past work and supported by preliminary data, is that fluctuations in the excitability of neurons?oscillations?play a key role in speech processing. Aim 1 tests the general hypothesis that delta/theta range (2-8 Hz) neuronal oscillations play a key role in the integration of auditory and visual speech information. Aim 2 tests the general hypothesis that high-frequency activity (50 Hz and above) encodes representations of auditory and visual speech information, reflecting both bottom-up and top-down influences on perception.  The concept employed in this proposal of oscillatory dynamics as mechanistic instruments (Aim 1) that organize the encoding of information in neuronal firing patterns under dynamic top-down control (Aim 2) are part of a paradigm shift in speech science. The broad goal of this proposal is to contribute key foundations for this new paradigm, and set the stage for a comprehensive understanding of the brain circuits and physiological processes underlying natural speech perception, including complex social settings.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Heart disease kills more men and women each year than any other malady. Presently, we know that following cardiac injury in adult mammals, the contractile cells making up the heart, cardiomyocytes, are permanently lost and replaced by fibrotic scar tissue, severely affecting the hearts contractile function and physiology. Furthermore, we also know that cardiomyocytes possess the ability to divide and regenerate following injury in neonatal mammals. However, this regenerative capacity is transient, as cardiomyocytes are essentially incapable of dividing in juvenile and adult mammals. Importantly, we have uncovered one of the cell intrinsic signaling pathways responsible for preventing cardiomyocyte cytokinesis and regeneration in adult mammals. Namely, it is the Hippo-signaling pathway, which plays a central role in maintaining the proper size of organs, like the heart, through restricting cell proliferation. Remarkably, when Hippo-pathway components are knocked out in adult murine cardiomyocytes, they regain the ability to undergo cytokinesis and contribute to regeneration following myocardial function. So, both neonatal and postnatal Hippo-deficient cardiomyocytes are capable of renewing and regenerating, while adult cardiomyocytes can be classified as essentially non-mitotic and non- regenerative. However, the complete molecular mechanisms responsible for imparting neonatal and Hippo-deficient cardiomyocytes their regenerative abilities are unknown. What is more, it is possible that only a small, specialized subpopulation of cardiomyocytes are able to renew and divide post-injury. And that instead of global activation of neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation, there is an induction of this specialized cardiomyocyte sub-population to expand and regenerate the tissue. Yet, the heterogeneity of neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes remains undetermined, and the distinct cellular identity of proliferative and regenerative cardiomyocytes is unknown. Using innovative techniques in genetics, epigenomics, nuclear RNA sequencing, and single-cell transcriptomic profiling we aim to determine the genes, and signaling pathways responsible for promoting cardiomyocyte regeneration. Specifically, we propose to (1) define the cardiomyocyte-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes present during cardiac regeneration, as well as their up-stream transcriptional regulators, and (2) determine the heterogeneity and cellular plasticity of cardiomyocytes during regeneration.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary The continued spread of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections has rendered tuberculosis (TB) a global health pandemic and pressed home the urgent need for new drugs. Compounds which inhibit essential components of the Mtb cell wall rapidly cause cell death and are represented clinically by isoniazid. If any drug combination is likely to reduce treatment duration and prevent the emergence of new antibacterial resistance, it will be a sterilizing synergistically acting therapy. In this proposal, our aim is to develop a new TB therapy that targets a validated druggable pathway and commences with a validated lead compound. The long- term goal is a new drug effective against both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant Mtb. The drug lead DG167 targets KasA, an essential enzyme involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis. The atomic-scale interactions between KasA and DG167 and multiple analogs of differing chemotype have been established in high-resolution X-ray crystal structures. Our work corrects a previous GSK structure and shows that two molecules of DG167 are bound in KasA. DG167 shows synergy in killing studies with the established drug isoniazid. DG167/isoniazid combinations lead to rapid sterilization of Mtb cultures and show synergy in a mouse model of acute Mtb infection. A DG167/isoniazid combination could shorten TB treatment by accelerating clearance of replicating bacteria in acute TB disease. Here, we propose to advance lead optimization of DG167. Our experienced project team is comprised of academic and industrial researchers with an established track record of collaboration and the common goal of devising new antitubercular drug therapies. The complimentary key skill sets in medicinal chemistry, cheminformatics, structural biology, microbiology, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics are all present and will be leveraged to deliver an optimized lead candidate inhibitor of Mtb KasA with enhanced in vivo efficacy as compared to the early lead DG167. This will prepare us for a Phase II program that would complete the optimization and set the stage for pre-IND toxicology studies.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  Filoviruses cause severe hemorrhagic fevers and are among the deadliest human viruses with no approved treatment or prophylactic options. Periodic outbreaks, such as the recent epidemic of Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa, exhibit mortality rates ranging from 50-90%. They are classified as ?Category A priority bioweapon agents? by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most advanced candidates for anti-filovirus therapy with proven efficacy in non-human primates (NHPs) utilize RNA interference (RNAi), high dose mixtures of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), or repurposed influenza, herpes or hepatitis C inhibitors. Although they represent important advances, these approaches have serious limitations including the high therapeutic doses required (20-30 g of mAb/patient), limited spectrum (primarily Zaire strain) and/or narrow therapeutic windows (small molecules/RNAi).  Building on recent work demonstrating the critical nature of endosomal interactions between the filoviral glycoprotein (GP) and the host cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) for filoviral entry, we have developed small molecules and antibodies that disrupt this mechanism to inhibit viral entry. These include several bispecific GP-targetomg pan-ebolavirus broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) efficacious in multiple animal models, with down-selection to a final cocktail based on NHP efficacy underway. In parallel, we identified an NPC1-binding phenylpiperazine (MBX-3587), which inhibits the GP-NPC1 interaction to block infection by virulent EBOV and MARV at low to sub ÂµM concentrations in vitro, demonstrates excellent PK/PD properties, exhibits excellent murine tolerability, has established efficacy in mice, and is currently being optimized for a targeted IND. In this proposal we will tether MBX-3587 to bispecific pan-ebola bNABs to target broad-spectrum antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that synergistically inhibit viral entry.  The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate that these ADCs will provide improved efficacy and selectivity for filovirus treatment over either agent alone, providing highly efficacious pan-ebola agents, broadening the therapeutic window and easing drug stockpiling efforts. We will accomplish this objective through three specific aims: In Aim 1 we will synthesize and complete physical characterization of >40 ADCs demonstrating serum stability with efficient endosomal release. In Aim 2 we will prioritize ADCs through in vitro analysis of pan-ebola inhibitory activity. In Aim 3 we prioritize ADCs for PK and toxicity and evaluate two pan- ebola ADCs for in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of EBOV infection.',\n",
       " 'Dr. Rajasingham is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases & International Medicine at the University of Minnesota. Her long-term goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of innovative diagnostics and therapeutics related to the prevention and management of AIDS-related opportunistic infections. She is particularly interested in using cost-effectiveness analysis alongside clinical trials, in order to translate effective interventions into policy.  Training: This K23 award will provide the mentored clinical research experience and didactic training in decision analysis and simulation modeling necessary to establish her independent research career. With the mentorship of an interdisciplinary team with expertise in decision analysis, biostatistics, and HIV international clinical trials, she will: 1) acquire advanced training in decision analysis and simulation modeling, 2) acquire expertise in HIV international clinical research methodology, and 3) develop multidisciplinary collaborative and networking skills.  Research: Cryptococcus is a leading cause of AIDS-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) can be detected in the blood weeks to months prior to the onset of meningitis and is an independent predictor of mortality. A public health strategy to reduce mortality is to screen for CRAG in the plasma of people entering HIV care with a CD4 count <100 cells/mcL. Those who are asymptomatic CRAG+ can be treated preemptively with fluconazole antifungal therapy to prevent meningitis or death while receiving HIV therapy. Despite the survival benefit associated with this WHO-recommended CRAG screening and treatment strategy, ~30% of asymptomatic CRAG+ persons die despite standard of care treatment with fluconazole. Those with high CRAG titers (>1:160) are 3 times more likely to die than are those with low CRAG titers (<1:80) in blood. I hypothesize that customized antifungal therapy based on CRAG titers will improve survival, whereby patients with high titers (>1:160) require more aggressive antifungal therapy.  The overall objective of this proposal is to identify a more clinically effective yet economically feasible treatment strategy for asymptomatic CRAG+ persons. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine if enhanced antifungal therapy improves 6-month survival for asymptomatic persons with high CRAG titers; 2) determine the cost-effectiveness of enhanced antifungal therapy for HIV-infected CRAG+ persons, stratified by CRAG titer; and 3) validate a novel semi-quantitative CRAG lateral flow assay to rapidly detect high CRAG titers (>1:160). The proposed study seeks to improve the international standard of clinical care for HIV-infected persons with advanced disease, and to generate evidence that will inform international HIV care guidelines. The findings and the training in decision analysis that Dr. Rajasingham will obtain will inform future proposals to evaluate cost-effective strategies to reduce AIDS-related deaths across sub-Saharan Africa.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT There are no effective therapies to treat Cryptosporidium, an important opportunistic pathogen of AIDS patients that is now recognized as significant cause of diarrheal disease worldwide. Individuals who are immunocompromised are highly susceptible to cryptosporidiosis and experience chronic, debilitating and sometimes fatal diarrhea unless the immune system can be reconstituted. Development of effective therapeutics for cryptosporidiosis is undoubtedly a medical imperative. Many therapeutics in clinical use today are, or are derived from, natural products and a large untapped source of naturally occurring bioactive compounds is the ocean. We propose to search for novel anti-cryptosporidial compounds with therapeutic potential in a unique chemical library of marine compounds. The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute (HBOI) natural products library consists of 125 purified compounds and 6500 highly enriched fractions from extracts of marine organisms collected from a wide range of habitats including deep sea enviroments; the diversity and novelty of the compounds contained in this library has been well documented and includes compounds effective against the related apicomplexan pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. To illustrate the potential success of this approach, in screening just a few strains of marine symbiotic bacteria for bioactive compounds we discovered the compound Tartrolon D that is broadly effective at nM levels against multiple apicomplexan parasites including Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium. Therefore we hypotheisze that screening the HBOI library against Cryptosporidium will identify multiple novel compounds with potent activity against this parasite. We will test this hypothesis through completion of the following aims: Aim 1: Screen the HBOI Peak library against Cryptosporidium parvum-infected cells using a high throughput assay for cell viability. The library will be tested against Cryptosporidium-infected intestinal epithelial cells and anti-parasitic activity detected by an increase in host-cell viability. Aim 2: Prioritization of anti-Cryptosporidium active fractions and purified compounds. Positive hits will be verified by examining activity against luciferase-expressing Cryptosporidium in standard cell culture and in intestinal and lung organoids. Positive hits will also be tested against Toxoplasma gondii. Aim 3. Isolation and structure elucidation of active compounds: Positive fractions with the greatest potential for discovery of novel inhibitors will be taken through further purification and the structures of the active compounds defined using spectroscopic methods. Currently there are only a handful of anti-cryptosporidial compounds in various stages of development. Expanding drug discovery, especially into the realm of natural products, is critical to the ultimate goal of bringing an effective anti-Cryptosporidium therapeutic to the clinics.',\n",
       " \"Background: Contextualizing care is the process of adapting care plans to patients' individual needs and circumstances. For instance, a plan to address poorly controlled diabetes is contextualized when it addresses possible barriers to self-care, such as visual problems that create physical barriers to medication self-administration, or competing responsibilities that interfere with scheduled appointments. Conversely, a failure to attend to contextual factors, such as increasing the dosage of insulin rather than addressing the obstacles to adherence when present, is termed a ?contextual error? because it is an inappropriate plan of care that can lead to clinical deterioration and greater health care cost. Identifying contextual errors requires listening to an audio recording of the encounter and coding the audio for specific indicators of context and clinicians' attention to them. Evidence indicates that inattention to patient context is common, adversely impacts health care outcomes, increases costs through overuse and misuse of services, and creates obstacles to patient adherence to care plans. An extensive program of research on contextual errors and how to prevent them has culminated in a VISN 12 funded quality improvement initiative that is based on audit and feedback, in which audio recorded data is collected by Veterans on provider attention to care planning, analyzed and organized using Content Coding for Contextualization of Care (?4C?) system and fed back to PACTs and clinicians to facilitate continuous quality improvement.  Objectives: To identify the most efficient, effective, and acceptable data driven strategy for improving contextualization of care in VHA through an implementation and efficacy study of the expansion of an audit & feedback for contextualizing care intervention package (?package?) in VISN 12. The study will assess the efficacy of the intervention package at two levels of intensity, the effectiveness of implementation strategies, and the potential of the intervention to pay for itself by reducing unnecessary care.  Design: We propose an Effectiveness-Implementation type 2 hybrid design because we have two co-primary aims: optimizing implementation and evaluating the intervention's effectiveness. In addition, we seek to document the costs and cost savings of the intervention package to ascertain its budget impact. The project will utilize the RE-AIM implementation-evaluation framework to assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance of the intervention. The project will add four additional sites to the two currently engaged in the package, two in VISN 12 and two outside. The rollout of the package will follow a randomized stepped wedge design comparing baseline at the 4 new sites (no intervention) to both a standard and enhanced feedback intervention, with the latter more intensive but more costly.  Analysis: Assessment of efficacy will measure impact on contextualization of care rates, health care outcomes, and costs, the latter through a budget impact analysis. Assessment of implementation will employ survey and focus group methods to identify and address obstacles to implementation, optimizing the extent to which it is perceived as safe, not burdensome, and valuable by clinicians and patients.  Impact: This project takes a decade of research on contextual error and a recent pilot project to prevent them, and applies that work to the refinement and assessment of a strategy for reducing these errors with an approach that may be scalable and transformative for the Veterans' care. By focusing on ?novel strategies to change provider behavior within the context of a learning health care system,? it is a response to the Provider Behavior RFA. It is also aligned with the VHA's new Blueprint for Excellence which seeks, through ?performance improvement?to improve not only the care, but the health and well- being of individuals.?\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Working memory is the ability to hold items ?in mind?. It is at the core of cognition, providing the workspace for complex behaviors. However, despite its critical nature, working memory is surprisingly limited: holding 3-4 items at a time. To compensate for this limited capacity, working memory is dynamically controlled: access to working memory is tightly regulated and representations in working memory are selectively manipulated. Disrupting one?s ability to control working memory can be pathological; such disruptions are believed to be a core cognitive deficit in schizophrenia1 and may underlie intrusive thoughts in anxiety2 and depression3. To develop novel, mechanistically-informed, treatments for these diseases, we must first develop a detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms that control working memory. We propose to investigate three ways in which working memory is controlled: First, one must be able to control access to working memory. A ?gating? signal is thought to provide this control: to-be-remembered stimuli are gated into memory; to-be-ignored stimuli are not. Our first aim will distinguish hypotheses on the source of this gating signal; we will leverage our novel many-electrode recording techniques in non-human primates to test how interactions between prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia gate representations into memory. In addition, we will test the prediction that gating changes the temporal dynamics of sensory representations in order to maintain them in memory. Second, once a set of items are in working memory, one must be able to select a specific item in order to use it to guide behavior. This process is akin to attention, which selects specific external stimuli. Our second aim will use our many-electrode recording techniques to a) discover the neural mechanisms that control selection from working memory and b) test hypotheses that relate these mechanisms to those that control attention. Third, when remembering multiple stimuli, one must judiciously allocate the limited resource of working memory amongst them: stimuli with greater behavioral relevance should be more accurately remembered. Our third aim will determine how neurons in prefrontal and parietal cortex control the prioritization of items in working memory and how this prioritization impacts working memory representations throughout prefrontal, parietal, and sensory cortices. While our proposed research is basic in nature, we believe it is an important first step in a mechanistic understanding of the core cognitive deficits of several mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and anxiety. Our hope is that this understanding will improve mental health by leading to new diagnostics and treatments for cognitive disorders. In particular, we hope to use our results to develop physiological markers that will improve detection, allow for earlier intervention, and guide targeted treatments. Our long-term goal is to develop a cognitive prosthetic that combines electrophysiology and stimulation to treat neuropsychiatric diseases.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY  Angioedema (AE) is a rare clinical symptom reported to affect at least 200,000 people in the US and approximately 1 in 30-50,000 persons worldwide. It is readily recognized as a usually asymmetrical, non- erythematous, non-pruritic, non-pitting, localized, transient, episodic swelling of a soft body area involving lax skin, oropharyngolaryngeal tissue and/or gastrointestinal wall. Chronically recurrent angioedema causes significant personal, domestic, social, and occupational disability and exposes patients to the risk of death due to suffocation. Angioedema includes: hereditary angioedema (HAE), which is attributed to complete genetic deficiency or functionally disruptive mutations in the C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) gene (located on chromosome 11q12-q13); drug-induced AE? which today is the fastest growing group of patients?which occurs in a segment of population under treatment with ACE-inhibitors; and idiopathic AE, which is of unknown origin. C1-INH is the major regulator of the key enzymes involved in both the complement and kinin/kallikrein (KKS) systems. Therefore its physical or functional absence leads to uncontrolled activation of both systems resulting in the overproduction by the KKS of a potent vasoactive peptide, bradykinin (BK)?the major mediator of the swelling. Although several therapeutic interventions for short-term or long-term treatments are available?including C1- INH replacement therapy?each treatment presents itself with major or minor deleterious side effects. More importantly, the current therapeutic agents only target downstream events long after the KKS has been triggered. Therefore, new therapeutic modalities that address these concerns and target upstream events are a much-needed and unmet challenge. The receptor for the globular heads of C1q, gC1qR, is the major zinc- dependent high affinity receptor for both high molecular weight kininogen (HK) and FXII, and plays a central role in the assembly and activation of the KKS. Blockade of gC1qR with mAb 74.5.2, which inhibits HK binding to endothelial cells, also prevents kinin generation and vascular permeability in vivo (US patent recently awarded). The proposed studies are therefore designed to accomplish three goals. First, to solve the crystal structures of gC1qR: (i) in complex with HK and/or HKH20; and with mAb 74.5.2, (ii) then, using an vitro model of vascular permeability, to asses the presence and the activity of the permeabilizing factor(s) in plasma samples obtained from various AE patients, and (iii) to examine the therapeutic potential of not only mAbs but also small peptide inhibitors (linear or cyclic)?identified from the structure-function studies and pre-screened in Aim II? in a mouse model of intravital microscopy. The results from these studies, in turn, will not only elucidate the structural, physiological, and molecular correlates involved in the induction or enhancement of vascular permeability during the attack phase of angioedema, but in the long term, full understanding of the role of gC1qR in the pathophysiology of this syndrome will provide a sound rationale for the design of novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of hereditary or ACE-induced AE.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center was founded as a matrix center within the Duke University School of Medicine in 1972 and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) was created as a new administrative entity within Duke Medicine in October, 2010, with authority and responsibility for all cancer-related activities at Duke University and in the Duke University Health System. The DCI was started with significant investments from Duke Medicine, including a new $243M clinical care outpatient facility, over $60 million of new funds available to support new initiatives, a formula for ongoing investment by the Duke Health System to support ongoing and new DCI initiatives, and additional laboratory and office-based research space. These new commitments were in addition to the clinical space and administrative and Shared Resource lab space already under DCI control and the many laboratories in the Duke School of Medicine and University housing DCI members. The first DCI Executive Director, Michael Kastan, M.D., Ph.D., was hired in August, 2011, followed by major changes in administrative infrastructure, leadership positions and roles, and Cancer Center committees. CCSG Programs and Shared Resources were re-organized, investments were made in high-priority areas, and mechanisms established to more effectively facilitate communication and collaborations among DCI faculty. The DCI, which currently consists of 354 members from 25 departments within 5 schools at Duke University (Medicine, Nursing, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, and Business), promotes collaborations between faculty and staff involved in cancer care, research, and education within both Duke University and the Duke University Health System. It is organized as 9 multi-disciplinary research programs (2 basic discovery, 1 population science, and 6 translational) whose work is supported by 13 Shared Resources (8 lab-based and 5 supporting translational/ clinical/ population research activities). On average, approximately 6000 new cancer patients are seen each year at Duke University Hospital (DUH); during the previous 5 calendar years, an average of approximately 1900 patients per year were enrolled on therapeutic clinical trials at DUH and partner sites, the vast majority of which were at DUH. Almost two-thirds of the DCI therapeutic clinical trials represent early phase research (pilot, phase I, phase II). DCI members are supported by over $242M of external cancer- related grant support, $160M of which is peer-reviewed. DCI grant support includes 51 multi-investigator projects and 91 training and fellowship awards. DCI members published over 8000 papers in peer-reviewed journals during the past funding period, ~39% of which represent collaborative efforts between DCI investigators (12% intra-program, 21% inter-program, and 6% both). The DCI will continue to utilize effective oversight and strategic planning to integrate all cancer-related activities in it purview, from basic research to translational studies to clinical and population investigation to patient care to community outreach to regional/national strategies to global cancer.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a three-year research proposal that aims to help the principal investigator to achieve and expand the aims of her K08 award, and at the same time it will help to gather enough preliminary data to apply for federal NIH R01 grant. The principal investigator currently holds a mentored career development award, K08 AR064834-01, entitled Choline kinase: a novel target for rheumatoid arthritis and mentored by Drs. Firestein, Karin and Kavanaugh. One of the points in her career development is to develop skill sets required to conduct independent investigation in patient-oriented research in the field of Rheumatology, and more precisely to get experience in biomarker analysis using metabolomics studies. Her K08 aims to explore the role of choline metabolites and its downstream products as diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis by magnetic resonance spectrometry. Preliminary data suggest that expanding this aim into a more detailed study by mass spectrometry and realizing an untargeted study of the metabolites in both fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and serum from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) will help to achieve this aim. Metabolomics is a new emerging field in biomarker research. Based on the assumption that diseases can be traced using physiological information from the metabolome, the changes in metabolite levels can be used for biomarker research. Biomarkers useful in diagnosis or predicting responses to different treatments in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remain an unmet medical need, especially in patients not responsive to TNF blockers or in patients with progressive joint damage. We have recently identified choline kinase as a potential therapeutic target in RA. Choline metabolism plays an important role in FLS functions that contribute to their aggressive behavior and joint destruction. Of interest, choline metabolism is a potential prognostic marker in oncology. Our long-term objective would be to determine suitability of choline metabolites or other metabolites as a biomarker of FLS activation and joint damage. To address this question, and as a specific goal, we will analyze more precisely choline metabolites and downstream effectors in resting FLS and after stimulation with cytokines involved in RA by magnetic resonance spectrometry (MRS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Metabolites will be analyzed in cells and supernatants to determine the most suitable metabolites as biomarkers. Untargeted analysis will also help to identify other potential biomarkers. We will also determine i metabolites detected in FLS are detectable in serum or urine samples of RA patients compared to normal and patients with other inflammatory diseases. The relationship between chosen metabolites, seropositivity, erosive disease, and disease activity as determined by DAS28 would be determined. If successful, our studies could translate into important diagnostic and prognostic tests that will identify patients at high risk for FLS activation and joint damage, and identify the most appropriate therapy.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to establish a novel mechanism by which dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) regulates the phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). Transition of SMC from a differentiated phenotype to a dedifferentiated state accompanied by neointima formation/vascular remodeling plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, transplantation arteriopathy, asthma, and cancer. The mechanisms and factors that regulate SMC phenotypic modulation and neointima formation, however, are poorly understood. Under physiological conditions, DOCK2 is only expressed in hematopoietic cells and controls lymphocyte migration and activation by regulating actin cytoskeleton through Rac activation. Our exciting preliminary data demonstrate that platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, a SMC phenotype modulator, induced DOCK2 expression in SMC. Knockdown of DOCK2 blocked PDGF-BB-induced SMC phenotypic modulation, proliferation, and migration. In vivo animal studies showed that DOCK2 was undetectable in SMC of normal rat carotid arteries, but was induced in the media layer SMC initially and neointimal SMC subsequently following balloon catheter-induced vascular injury. Importantly, knockdown of DOCK2 dramatically inhibited the injury- induced neointima formation. The most conclusive evidence for DOCK2-dependent vascular remodeling/ neointima formation was that knockout of DOCK2 (DOCK2-/-) dramatically blocked artery ligation-induced neointima hyperplasia in mouse carotid artery. Interestingly, DOCK2 is localized in both cell membrane and nuclei of SMC, suggesting that in addition to its role in cytoskeleton/cell migration, DOCK2 may be involved in SMC gene transcription. Indeed, DOCK2 overexpression blocked both SMC gene mRNA expression and myocardin-induced activation of smooth muscle ?-actin promoter. Thus, the central hypothesis is that DOCK2 regulates SMC phenotypic modulation by suppressing SMC gene transcription and stimulating SMC migration/ proliferation, leading to neointima formation/vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMC, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) study the molecular mechanisms by which DOCK2 modulates SMC phenotype through regulating SMC gene transcription; 2) investigate if DOCK2 induces SMC migration through activation of Rac/RhoA/ Cdc42; and 3) determine the essential role of DOCK2 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. The completion of this project will unravel a novel mechanism regulating SMC phenotypic modulation and provide novel insights into whether DOCK2 is a potential therapeutic target for countering vascular damage associated with common diseases including diabetes, restenosis, atherosclerosis, and cancer.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In response to PAR-14-338: Secondary Analyses of Existing Alcohol Epidemiology Data, this project Sexual Orientation, Discrimination, and Health Disparities in DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorders proposes to use existing alcohol epidemiological data to examine relationships among sexual orientation, childhood adversity, sexual orientation discrimination (individual-level and institutional-level), recent stressful events and DSM-5 alcohol use disorders (AUDs). AUDs are among the most prevalent mental health disorders and contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over 65 million adults in the U.S. will meet criteria for a DSM-5 AUD, with past research finding that sexual minorities are at disproportionately high risk for AUD. To date, no large-scale nationally representative studies have examined sexual-orientation-related health disparities in DSM-5 AUD and there is limited data on DSM-5 AUD severity, comorbidity, and disability among sexual minorities. A significant gap in knowledge remains regarding the underlying reasons why sexual minorities are more likely to meet criteria for DSM-5 AUD. Thus, we propose to build on our prior work by conducting secondary analyses using the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III), a nationally representative sample of 36,309 U.S. adults. The NESARC-III is the only nationally representative study that has sufficient measures and sample size to test for potential age, gender, racial/ethnic and sexual orientation differences and to meet the objectives of our study, which aims to: (1) estimate the prevalence of (a) DSM-5 AUD diagnoses including severity (mild, moderate and severe), (b) identify potential differences in AUD diagnoses between DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria, and (c) examine DSM-5 psychiatric comorbidity associated with DSM-5 AUD based on sexual orientation (attraction, behavior, and identity); (2) assess the disability (social functioning), help seeking (e.g., self-help), and recovery (e.g., abstinence) associated with DSM-5 AUD based on sexual orientation; and (3) examine risk factors (e.g., individual- and institutional-level sexual orientation discrimination, and stressful life events). Analyses will focus on multiple developmental domains (i.e., childhood, adolescence, adulthood, past-year) and potential moderators (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, and childhood adversity) associated with DSM-5 AUD severity, psychiatric comorbidity, and disability among sexual minorities. The proposed project will benefit from the unique opportunities afforded by the 2012-2013 NESARC such as: the largest nationally representative sample of sexual minority women and men currently available; the assessment of all three major dimensions of sexual orientation (attraction, behavior and identity); and the wealth of data on DSM-5 AUD and other psychiatric disorders. We will also examine the impact of changes from the DSM-IV to DSM-5 for AUDs among sexual minorities. The project uses a theory-driven approach in assessing how childhood adversity, sexual orientation discrimination, and recent stressors contribute to alcohol-related health disparities based on sexual orientation.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Complex diseases such as schizophrenia (SCZ) result from multifactorial genetic and environmental perturbations that cause pleiotropic changes in molecular networks, resulting in disease. The goal of our project is to move our CommonMind Consortium (CMC) data generation to the next level, focusing on cell-type specific data generation including transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and integrated analyses, from critical regions implicated in SCZ to improve our ability to identify and refine genetic risk factors for SCZ. We will characterize cell-type specific transcriptome and epigenome components in our post-mortem CMC SCZ and control cohort and in new control autopsy specimens. In 50 SCZ cases and 50 controls from the CMC, we will 1.) perform RNA, sequencing, 2.) ATACseq, and 3.) Hi-C in nuclei isolated from pools of glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, and oligodendrocytes isolated from the prefrontal cortex. In the same samples we characterize proteins of post-synaptic density proteins by liquid chromatography (LC)-selective reaction monitoring (SRM)-mass spectrometer (MS) quantitative proteomic analyses. In order to uncover how many distinct types of cells are present in various brain regions of control individuals we will use nanofluidics and bar-coding (Drop-seq) from freshly autopsied, never frozen or fixed control specimens. Integrative analyses will be pursued that will combine genetic, gene expression, epigenomic and proteomic data to identify novel SCZ genes. Finally, we will continue to maintain and upgrade our community workspace that provides for the rapid dissemination and open evaluation of data, analyses, and outcomes derived from the CMC. We will continue to make all data available to the research community through the Sage Bionetworks Synapse Platform. There is a deep need to more cell-type specific information on the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape in the human brain, and in particular in neurons and glia and to integrate this information with human SCZ genetics. We have assembled the critical key personnel, sample resources, technological know-how, and analytic strategies to be able to provide both useful maps for the field, as well as begin to unravel SCZ biology.',\n",
       " \"Abstract  Native lung surfactant (LS) consists of a mixture of lipids and proteins that together posses the ability to lower the alveolar surface tension, and thus is essential for normal breathing. While the exact mechanisms of acute lung injury (ALI), and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are currently not well understood, LS inactivation by surface active inhibitory proteins, enzymes, fatty acids and lyso-lipids are believed to play a contributing role. Published and preliminary work reveals that even small fractions of ARDS-implicated components may change the surface viscosity and elasticity of monolayers by orders of magnitude: thousand-fold increases in phospholipid monolayer stiffness when saturated fatty acids are added or albumin adsorbs, whereas 100-1000-fold decreases occur when 1-2% cholesterol is added.  These results suggest a plausible mechanical mechanism for ARDS progression, and the central hypothesis of the proposed project: that the rheological (e.g. viscous and elastic) properties of ARDS- inactivated LS play a central, causative role in the ARDS cascade, and in the inability of RS therapies to effectively reverse ARDS progression. An initial insult to the lung introduces blood proteins through permeabilized alveolar walls, and heightened levels of the enzyme PLA2, as part of the inflammatory response. Previous results suggest that either of these situations would create heterogeneous, rheologically elastic domains deep in the lung: PLA2 by digesting phospholipids to produce lyso-lipids and fatty acids, and blood proteins through adsorption. Well-known phenomena in continuum mechanics suggest that elastic heterogeneities within the LS strongly resist the curvature changes that occur naturally during respiration, and may even `crack' or `crumple' rather than deform smoothly. Such abnormal deformations would thus exert strong, localized mechanical stresses on the alveolar epithelium, promoting further tissue damage and inflammation, and ultimately to greater levels of protein and PLA2. Notably, the hypothesized mechanism is physical in origin, and derives from how the organization of these components in the LS monolayer affects their ability to flow and deform. Such a mechanism could not be uncovered from chemical assays alone.  To test this hypothesis, the impact of LS-inactivating factors (blood proteins, fatty acids, enzymes) on the rheology of model LS monolayers will be measured with first-of-their-kind techniques, as well components (e.g. natural or synthetic surfactant proteins, mono-unsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol) that may reduce or reverse the inactivation. Using both novel experimental techniques and theory, the molecular composition of inactivated LS will be related to elastic heterogeneities, and elastic heterogeneities to anisotropic alveolar inflation and deflation. Finally, the mixing and evolution of heterogeneous monolayers will be studied to identify strategies to dissolve, disrupt or displace these elastic heterogeneities, and ultimately guiding therapeutic formulations.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this proposal is to combine functional mutagenesis, biochemistry, and structural biology, to understand the molecular architecture of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter. Early biochemical studies demonstrated that isolated mitochondria could transport and buffer huge amounts of Ca2+ across their inner membrane via a highly selective, Ru360-sensitive channel called the ?uniporter?. Uptake of Ca2+ via the uniporter is known to activate the TCA cycle, while its overload leads to cell death. Although the uniporter has been studied extensively for over 50 years, its molecular identity remained elusive until our group utilized comparative genomics to discover its molecular components. In humans, the minimal genetic elements required for uniporter current are MCU (the pore forming protein) and EMRE (a single-pass membrane protein). We have recently shown that Dictyostelium discoideum harbors a simpler uniporter, requiring only one component (DdMCU, the homolog of MCU), which is necessary and sufficient for uniporter activity and complements the requirement for MCU or EMRE in human knockout cells. At present, the molecular basis for the uniporter?s selectivity, mechanistic basis for inhibition by Ru360, and why the animal uniporter requires EMRE are unclear. Recently, we have solved the NMR structure of the channel-forming region of MCU using a N-Terminal Domain (NTD) truncated but fully functional construct from C. elegans, named cMCU-?NTD. The structure, which represents a new architecture for Ca2+ channel, provides the much-needed framework for addressing the above questions. Aims 1 and 2 will use DdMCU, which is active by itself, to address the open state of MCU, whereas Aims 3 and 4 will focus on animal MCU and EMRE, to address the mechanism of how EMRE activates the MCU channel. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform systematic but hypothesis- driven mutagenesis of DdMCU to identify key residues important for the function and pharmacologic properties of this channel. In Aim 2, we will determine the structure of DdMCU using independent structural approaches including crystallography, EM, and NMR. In Aim 3, we will investigate the biochemistry and topology of EMRE and perform systematic mutagenesis to identify protein regions critical for MCU-EMRE interaction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will investigate Ca2+ and Ru360 binding to MCU using the cMCU-?NTD NMR system, and perform biochemical and structural characterization of MCU-EMRE interaction, including solving the high resolution structure of EMRE alone in lipid bilayer. The proposed studies will yield deep insights into the molecular architecture and mechanisms of the uniporter that promise to have implications for a range of human diseases.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne alphavirus that cycles directly between humans and mosquitoes and causes a debilitating febrile illness in humans on a global scale. Autochthonous transmission in the New World now has been described, with outbreaks in at least 19 countries in the Americas and over a quarter million cases in just 6 months. CHIKV disease cases have been reported to ArboNET in travelers returning to the US from the Caribbean in 29 states, as of July 1. The potential for epidemics in North and South America is high due to the ubiquitous distribution of one of its primary vectors, Aedes albopictus. Despite the possibility for infecting and causing disease in millions, specific treatments or vaccines for CHIKV are not available. A primary goal of this project is to define the molecular, genetic, immunologic, and structural characteristics of ultra-potent neutralizing human mAbs with broad activity against all genotypes of CHIKV. Additional goals include defining the mechanistic correlates of protection by these ultra-potent neutralizing mAbs. In these studies, we will elucidate how antiviral Abs with exceptional inhibitory activity exert their action in cell culture and in vivo. The approach will include high efficiency isolationof human mAbs, coupled with innovative antibody gene repertoire studies based on nextgen sequencing. Several hypotheses will be tested, including the concept that ultra-potent neutralizing activity results from features of both the antibodies (extensive mutations due to persistent CHIKV infection) and the antigen (binding to quaternary epitopes on multiple adjacent envelope proteins and blocking structural transitions critical for virus entry or release). Althoug our focus is to understand how and why ultra-potent human mAbs inhibit CHIKV, the studies likely will be relevant to general principles of antibody neutralization of many different viruses. Beyond defining the molecular and structural basis of Ab neutralization of CHIKV, these studies will generate a group of fully human mAbs that can prevent and treat CHIKV infection and persistence in mice, which could be developed in the future as a possible combination immunotherapeutic for humans. Studies in this project, while targeted against CHIKV, likely will inform future Ab-based and/or vaccine efforts against other alphaviruses that cause human disease. We have assembled a unique group of investigators, including a human Ab expert, a molecular virologist with experience in Ab-virus interactions, and two accomplished structural biologists with specific expertise in alphaviruses, including CHIKV, to pursue these studies.',\n",
       " 'A group of excitatory neurons located in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) that express the transcription factor, Phox2b, integrate sensory inputs and information regarding brain state for transmission on to respiratory rhythm/pattern-generating circuits. In addition, RTN neurons adjust their firing in response to changes in CO2 (or H+) and adjust breathing to maintain physiologically appropriate levels of pH and PCO2, a homeostatic  process called central respiratory chemoreception. Dysfunction of central chemoreception is implicated in various central disorders of breathing that often occur during sleep (e.g., sudden infant death, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS)). In the last project period, we showed that Phox2b-expressing RTN  neurons are intrinsically chemosensitive, and identified two independent molecular proton sensors in RTN  neurons - TASK-2, a proton-inhibited background K+ channel and GPR4, a proton-activated G protein-coupled receptor - that are required for stimulation of breathing by CO2. Important questions remain, however,  regarding: the ionic basis for baseline firing properties and modulation by arousal state-dependent factors; the  effector systems engaged downstream of GPR4 in RTN neurons; and mechanisms by proposed astrocytic  modulation can be integrated with the requirement for GPR4 and TASK-2 in RTN-mediated respiratory  chemosensitivity. This proposal addresses these issues using: novel conditional knockout mouse lines; viral-mediated shRNA knockdown and/or rescue; single cell electrophysiology and molecular biology; and whole animal  assays of respiratory function and vigilance states. The hypothesis underpinning Specific Aim 1 is that TTX- resistant subthreshold Na+ channels, NALCN and NaV1.9, contribute to baseline excitability of RTN neurons and mediate facilitatory effects of neuropeptides associated with arousal state-dependent brain nuclei. We  disrupt expression of these channels in RTN neurons and determine effects on subthreshold Na+ currents, basal and neuropeptide-modulated firing in vitro, and arousal state-dependent respiratory CO2 sensitivity in vivo. The hypothesis driving Specific Aim 2 is that GPR4 engages a cAMP-transduction pathway and background K+ channel (independent of TASK-2) for cellular pH sensing in RTN neurons, and that astrocytic amplification of respiratory chemoreflexes involves boosting local pH changes around RTN neurons. We use  pharmacological and transcriptomic approaches in single RTN neurons to characterize the GPR4 signaling pathway and  effector channel, and we disrupt a pH-modulating Na+ -HCO3 transporter, NBCe1, in medullary astrocytes to  determine effects on the respiratory chemoreflex in vivo. This latter may support a convergent theory for  astrocyte-neuron contributions for this highly sensitive chemoreflex, bridging a major current divide in the field.  Collectively, the proposed studies provide critical information regarding molecular and cellular mechanisms that control activity of RTN neurons, and regulate this important homeostatic respiratory system.  Identification of novel molecular mechanisms may provide new therapeutic targets for disorders of breathing.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SATB2 is a homobox transcription factor first discovered in 2003 that binds to AT rich sequences and likely binds chromatin modifying enzymes such as histone acetyltranferases and deacetylases for the regulation of gene expression. A number of recent papers have described SATB2 overexpression in a variety of cancers and have emphasized the importance of this overexpressed gene in driving tumorigenesis. We have studied the malignant transformation of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS2B) by carcinogenic metals such as nickel (Ni), hexavalent chromium (Cr+6), arsenic (As) and vanadate (V). While each of these metals has its own unique signature of gene expression when they transform BEAS2B cells, the signature is vastly different from metal to metal. However, SATB2 is increased in every transformed clone by any one of these metals. SATB2 is not expressed in parental BEAS2B cells. Further studies have shown that SATB2 mRNA and protein are induced in BEAS2B cells by chronic Ni ion treatment. We hypothesize that SATB2 is a transcription factor needed for normal mammalian development but its inappropriate expression during chronic Ni exposure is a driver of cell transformation. We want to investigate the mechanisms and consequences of its overexpression in BEAS2B and 16HB cells exposed to and transformed by Ni. We will overexpress SATB2 in normal BEAS-2B and 16HBE cells and investigate the effect this has on the cell's transformed properties and study the expression of other genes in these cells using gene chips. SATB2 overexpression and resulting cell transformation will also be studied in the presence of nickel exposure. We will lower the levels of SATB2 by transient knockdown with siRNA and stable knockdown with small hairpin RNA in nickel transformed BEAS2B and 16HBE cells and study the consequences of SATB2 loss on their transformed properties and investigate the effect this knockdown has on the expression of other genes using gene chips in the nickel transformed cells. We will study the mechanism of SATB2 overexpression focusing on its promoter, enhancer, upstream regulators and miRNA that target SATB2 following chronic nickel treatment of BEAS2B and 16HBE cells and in nickel transformed cells. In addition, SATB2 overexpressed in BEAS2B and 16HBE cells and in Ni-transformed cells will be immunoprecipitated, and interacting protein partners will be identified by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. To address whether nickel is able to induce SATB2 expression in vivo, we will expose A/J mice to various doses of nickel by inhalation or ingestion, and analyze SATB2 expression in several target tissues. To explore the role of SATB2 in nickel-induced tumorigenesis, we will analyze the levels of SATB2 expression in rat lung tumors induced by nickel subsulfide exposure (obtained from National Toxicology Program archive).\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circadian clock plays a key role in coordinating many biological processes from behaviors to cellular metabolism and mitosis. Recent studies have linked disruption of circadian rhythms with increased breast cancer risk, suggesting women working alternative shifts may have a higher risk of breast cancer. Our recent results indicate that disruption of molecular timing negatively impacts several processes that determine the outcome of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolism, resulting in increased DNA damage. We have found that time of day, as well as individual circadian clock components, uniquely regulate processes governing benzo-a-pyrene (BaP) activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and estrogen receptor (ER) mediated endocrine disruptor (EDC) signaling in the mouse mammary gland and breast cancer cell lines. This new knowledge led us to hypothesize that the circadian clock influences BaP-mediated metabolism and DNA damage and repair, and that time of day, or disruption of the circadian clock, impacts the outcome of PAH exposure and EDC activity. To test this hypothesis we propose two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will define the circadian windows of susceptibility in mouse mammary tissues and MCF7 breast cancer cells by analyzing differences in BaP-induced AHR- and ER- signaling, formation and persistence of BaP-DNA adducts and DNA damage responses and the time course of BaP clearance using a novel multiphoton imaging approach to measure real time circadian-dependent differences in BaP metabolism in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will utilize a novel mammary gland transplant approach to discern for the first time in vivo central versus peripheral affects mediating circadia clock influences on acute BaP-induced toxicity and estrogen action in mammary tissues using circadian and AHR and ERa knockout mouse models and binding of AHR and ER in vivo by ChIP-Seq analysis. The expected outcomes of this research will be identification of the key sites of action and metabolic pathways by which PAHs interact with circadian clocks in promoting DNA damage and breast cancer.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arsenic is an odorless and tasteless semi-metal that contaminates drinking water supplies from natural deposits in the earth. It is estimated that almost 3.7 million individuals in the US, and over 140 million individuals worldwide, are exposed regularly to drinking water that exceed government arsenic standards. Increasing attention has been recently paid to the declines in functional mobility resulting from chronic arsenic exposure, which we now understand to pose a significant risk for causing skeletal muscle myopathies and atrophy, impairments that are among the greatest factors contributing to declines in functional mobility and strong predictors of mortality. However, many questions of the health impacts of environmental exposures throughout life remain, including the underlying mechanisms by which exposures negatively impact the cellular microenvironment, stem cell phenotype and, ultimately, tissue maintenance and healing capacity.  There is a need to know whether and how environmental toxicants affect tissue maintenance and adult stem cell behavior and it is important to resolve how stem cell vulnerability to environmental contaminants affects the ability of otherwise healthy tissues to respond to acute injury. It is also critical to identify mechanisms of impairment in designing strategies and policies to prevent or reduce injury. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms for arsenic-stimulated alteration of transcriptional circuitries that disrupt intra- and inter-cellular communication within the niche and compromise muscle structural integrity.  We propose two specific aims to test our central hypothesis that arsenic stimulates fibroblast- mediated pathogenic matrix alterations, resulting in stem cell dysfunction and, ultimately, impaired wound repair after injury. In Specific Aim 1, we will test th hypothesis that exposure to commonly encountered levels of arsenic in drinking water promotes pathologic matrix remodeling to impair muscle stem cell function and regenerative capacity. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that arsenic dysregulates fibroblast activation, drivin an impaired muscle stem cell function and tissue repair response after injury. Success in these aims will both increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of arsenic-induced clinical symptoms of myasthenia, and will elucidate skeletal muscle micro environmental factors controlling stem cell declines. The long-term goal is to create prevention and/or intervention strategies to improve health outcomes of individuals living in arsenic-endemic areas.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         In this resubmission, the applicants propose to use their previously developed fibrin-specific 99mTc small tetrameric molecule agent (99mTc-F4A) to quantify and characterize thrombus formation in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) circuits and compare the nuclear signal with pump histopathology results.  The panel agreed that the applicants did a good job of responding to the concerns of the previous reviewers, including eliminating the aim regarding developing a handheld device.  The ability to detect thrombus formation in VAD is an unmet clinical need with high significance, the team of investigators was considered very strong and the research environment was considered good.  The tetrameric probe was considered novel, with decreased plasma interference and improved affinity over previous probes.  The approach was logical within the aims, although the panel was concerned that the order of Aims seemed backwards (imaging the VAD in Aim 1 and optimizing the probe in Aim 2).  It was also not clear if uptake would be detectable, especially in the presence of an attenuating medium.  Reviewers also expressed concern regarding lack of access to a scanner for large animal work, because they agreed that imaging in a large animal model was needed.  Although these concerns tempered the enthusiasm of the reviewers for this application, the significance was thought to outweigh the difficulties, and the panel concluded that the proposed work could have a high impact on early recognition of thrombus formation in LVADs.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal application to support a training program begun in Uganda in 2000. The focus of our program has been consistent, with concentration on training in malaria research in Uganda. Our philosophy for training is to emphasize research, with trainees participating in both hands-on mentored malaria research and formal training programs designed to complement the hands on-training and facilitate growth of trainees into independent researchers. We believe that our program has been highly successful, as evidenced by the accomplishments of our trainees. About 50 Ugandan junior scientists have received advanced training, mostly at the Masters level, 13 of these trainees have so far advanced to PhD training, and our more senior trainees are advancing to academic positions in Uganda. Our trainees have authored ~250 papers during or after their training, with 61 first-author papers to date. We are gratified by the successes of our trainees. However, the need for training in malaria research in Uganda remains great. Thus, we feel that it is appropriate to continue our program, building upon our initial success and upon the structures for training that we have established. With maturation of our malaria research program in Uganda and an increased supply of highly qualified training applicants, we plan some changes to our program, in particular increased emphasis on higher level training. We now plan 5 training tracks: 1) short-term training outside Uganda; 2) Masters training at Makerere University; 3) advanced Masters training at UCSF; 4) sandwich PhD training at Makerere University; and 5) postdoctoral training. We are excited about our success to date with both training and research on malaria in Uganda, and we anticipate that continued funding will allow continued progress toward the establishment of cutting-edge independent research capacity in this country and also toward the control and elimination of malaria.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Unfortunately, there are significant CRC screening disparities that result in higher rates of CRC-related morbidity and mortality for minority and rural patient populations, particularly in the southern United States. The development of interventions that capitalize on advances in communication, informatics, and computer science have great promise for resolving theoretical and practical problems associated with CRC screening decision-making. The purpose of this proposal is to test the efficacy of a patient-centered, tailored message intervention delivered via virtual technology for increasing CRC screening within guidelines among racial/ethnic minority and rural patients. We hypothesize that exposure to a minimally tailored CRC screening intervention delivered via VHT will lead to improved cognitive processing of the intervention and increased adherence with initial and repeated annual FIT screening completion as compared to a fully tailored, text-only intervention. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups and think-aloud interviews stratified by geography, gender, and racial/ethnic background to expand and pilot test an intervention that uses a virtual human as a delivery mechanism for CRC screening information. In Specific Aim 2, patients (N = 3,000) will be recruited via primary care clinics and a secure, clinical data warehouse to complete a patient- randomized test of the efficacy of the intervention for promoting initial and repeat FIT testing. Dependent measures will be assessed via patient self-report and chart review. The proposed study will reduce health disparities and associated morbidity and mortality due to CRC via increasing screening among racial/ethnic minority and rural populations.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women in sub-Saharan Africa are at incredibly high risk of HIV infection; 76% of all new infections among young people occur in young women and 77% of HIV positive women globally live in sub-Saharan Africa. Given this, young women have been prioritized as a key population in need of urgent prevention interventions. However, there is a paucity of longitudinal data to understand the multiple levels of social, community, household, and individual factors that shape HIV incidence among young women in sub-Saharan Africa. To date, much of the data on HIV risk in young women has focused on individual-level factors; in particular sexual behavior, has been cross-sectional in nature and often has lacked rich information on social determinants which are key to shaping young women's HIV risk. The overall objective of this application is to determine the effect and mechanisms of effect of key social determinants measured at multiple levels (e.g., individual, household, and community) that influence HIV acquisition in young women in South Africa. In this application, we focus on three under-examined thematic areas which cross-cut multiple levels of influence and that our research and the literature suggest are critical to shaping young women's HIV risk-gender inequity, schooling and socio-economic status, and emotional well-being. Understanding how these determinants shape risk and protection is critical to developing effective interventions to reduce new HIV infection. We have established an ongoing cohort of 2,500 adolescent South African girls, followed through key life transitions into early adulthood; notably this data includes HIV incidence and many key determinants of HIV infection including important life transitions such as coital debut and school completion at multiple time-points. In this application, we propose one additional data collection point as the cohort is entering a period of high HIV incidence. Uniquely, we can link our cohort data with two rich data sets that contain community social environment data as well as population demographic surveillance (census) data. Using the data collected from our longitudinal cohort of young women combined with comprehensive demographic surveillance data and community-level context data, we have a unique opportunity to triangulate and leverage NIH-supported research in order to understand how key social determinants shape HIV risk in young women in South Africa as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood. We also will quantify how intervening on these key social determinants, separately and in combinations, could impact HIV incidence in young women providing critically needed insights for prevention programs targeting this population.\",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Despite decades of research, effective therapies for obesity are lacking. Given the magnitude of the obesity epidemic, there is a critical need for intervention strategies that effectively reduce body weight and maintain weight loss. Nodose ganglia (NG) neurons of the vagus nerve that innervate the gut are a key component of the nutrient sensing machinery that provides negative feedback to terminate a meal. Postprandial signals are sensed by vagal afferent terminals in the gut and the information is relayed centrally to neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). The neuropeptide cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) expressed by NG neurons is a primary molecular signal that controls caloric intake. In obesity, loss of vagal CART is sufficient to increase food intake and body weight. Therefore, we hypothesize that in diet-induced obesity, restoring CART expression in NG neurons will cause voluntary reduction in food intake and sustain body weight after weight loss interventions. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting CART and NG neurons innervating CART (NGCART) we will study 1) how metabolic cues are integrated in NGCART neurons, 2) how this information is relayed centrally, and 3) the impact of overexpressing CART in NG neurons on body weight. We apply powerful genetic and molecular neuroscience tools to the vagus nerve for in vivo imaging, connectivity mapping, and targeted overexpression in NGCART neurons. In aim 1, we propose to determine the metabolic signals that recruit NGCART neurons by using a Cre-dependent viral tracer injected into the NG of CARTCre mice to map the projections and terminals of NGCART neurons in the gut, and record the activation profile of these neurons in live animals by using a genetically targeted calcium indicator. In aim 2, we will combine multisynaptic circuitry tracing with serial two photon tomography to map NGCART neurons synaptic circuitry through the brain. In aim 3, we will use a cre- dependent CART overexpression virus to restore CART expression in NGCART neurons of CARTCre mice and determine the impact on feeding and body weight in diet induced obesity. These studies will elaborate on previous work by identifying a molecular and cellular target that can provide the foundation for developing peripheral treatments for obesity.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed K23 Career Development Award will enable Jennifer Woo Baidal, MD, MPH to establish an independent research career with expertise in childhood obesity and pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Dr. Woo Baidal is a pediatric gastroenterologist whose long-term goal is to translate epidemiologic and patient-oriented research findings to interventions to reduce childhood obesity and NAFLD in vulnerable populations, but further training is required to accomplish this goal. Thus, she has assembled a team of mentors to fulfill her immediate goal for advanced training in (1) diagnostic research principles in relation to pediatric NAFLD; (2) epidemiologic research including cohort design and implementation; (3) quantitative research including longitudinal data analysis; (4) genetic and genomic research; and (5) research dissemination and professional development. Pediatric NAFLD is a serious complication of childhood obesity and the most common chronic pediatric liver disease worldwide. NAFLD comprises a spectrum of phenotypes including hepatic steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and fibrosis/cirrhosis. Until recently, a major barrier to advancing understanding of risk factors for pediatric NAFLD has been lack of non-invasive diagnostic modalities that are practical in children. Transient elastography is a FDA-approved, non-invasive tool that simultaneously measures hepatic steatosis and fibrosis at the point-of-care, and is widely used in adults to monitor disease progression and treatment response. The candidate?s preliminary research supports the ability of transient elastography to diagnosis steatosis and fibrosis in children, thus allowing longitudinal studies of the emergence and progression of pediatric NAFLD in children with overweight and obesity. The proposed research consists of two inter-related aims to (1) complete a full-scale validation study for transient elastography in a pediatric setting and (2) use transient elastography to test specific dietary, behavioral, and biologic hypotheses related to etiology and progression of NAFLD in childhood. This research will leverage two existing cohorts at Columbia University Medical Center and will establish a cohort of 400 children at risk for NAFLD as a platform for future R01 applications. Successful completion of this project will shed new light on mechanisms that lead to development of pediatric NAFLD in children with overweight/obesity, and provide Dr. Woo Baidal the necessary training and experience to develop an independent research program focused on reduction of pediatric NAFLD in the context of childhood obesity.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine repeat in the protein huntingtin (mHtt), and is manifested by choreatic dyskinesias, personality changes, abnormal behaviors and cognitive deterioration. With the exception of symptomatic treatments there are no disease-modifying therapies for HD. Although mHtt is expressed ubiquitously in brain and peripheral tissue, it predominantly causes neuronal loss and damage in striatal tissue, a process that is poorly understood. Therefore, studies that define the mechanisms that contribute to the striatal degeneration are needed to develop new drugs that prevent and/or delay the onset of HD. Our long-term goal is to understand the role of striatal-specific proteins in HD pathogenesis for preventive and therapeutic purposes. The objective here, which is next step in pursuit of that goal, is to dissect the mechanisms of Rhes GTPase, that contains SUMO E3 ligase activity, in HD pathogenesis, and to identify its physiological SUMO substrates. Our central hypothesis is that Rhes-SUMO1-mHtt-mTORC1 circuitry elicits mitochondrial damage and HD pathogenesis. This hypothesis is formulated on the basis of our previous studies, new data and preliminary results. Our Aims are: 1: Dissect the role of Rhes-SUMO-mHtt-mTORC1 circuitry in mitochondrial dysfunction. Multiple studies support the role of Rhes in HD, but the mechanisms are unknown. Here we will dissect the mechanisms, using striatal cells, focusing on the Rhes-SUMO1 in mTORC1 activity and mitochondrial dysfunction; and 2: Challenge the deletion of SUMO1 in the amelioration of HD pathogenesis in mice. Despite known roles for SUMO1 in mHtt-induced cellular toxicity, its role in the pathogenesis of HD in mammal remains unknown. We will cross SUMO1-/- mice with N171HD mouse to elucidate behavioral and pathological outcomes; and 3: Identify SUMOylation substrates for Rhes. Besides SUMOylating mHtt, Rhes physiologically SUMOylates several striatal proteins, but their identity remains unknown. Using cell culture, in vitro SUMOylation assay, and proteomic approaches we will identify potential SUMO substrates for Rhes. Overall, the project is innovative because it employs an interdisciplinary approach, utilizing tools from mouse genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and behavior to dissect the pathway leading to striatal-specific cell loss. The results of this project will be significant, as it will advance our understanding of why striatal tissue is preferentially ost in an mHtt- dependent fashion and provide proof-of-principle for the development of drugs targeting Rhes signaling in HD.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal examines how a growth factor signaling pathway is linked to synapse structure and function. Growth factors are potent neuromodulators and play diverse roles at synapses. They regulate fundamental features of synaptic biology including baseline transmitter release, synapse morphology, and plasticity. Given their importance directing synapse organization, it is important to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms coupling synaptic growth factor signaling to synapses and neuronal activity. BMP/TGF? family members are evolutionarily conserved regulators of synapse structure and function. In particular, a BMP/TGF? pathway has neurotrophic pathway activity at the Drosophila NMJ. BMP pathway mutants display striking defects in NMJ morphology and function. Remarkably, distinct ligand pools independently regulate these synaptic features. We demonstrate that the presynaptic pool regulates synaptic structure and function, while the postsynaptic pool directs overall growth of the NMJ terminal. Understanding how these information channels are separated at an endogenous synapse is essential to understand how distinct synaptic features are independently controlled. Our entry point to this work is the novel neuronal transmembrane protein Crimpy. We have demonstrated that Crimpy enables discrimination between pre- and postsynaptic BMP pools. Crimpy binds a BMP homolog called Gbb and traffics it to presynaptic dense core vesicles (DCVs). Without Crimpy, Gbb is no longer found in DCVs and is not released by presynaptic activity. In the absence of Crimpy, pre- and postsynaptic ligand pools cannot be distinguished, and the NMJs are characterized by aberrant trophic signaling at the expense of the presynaptic synapse-organizing cue. In this proposal, we build on our novel preliminary findings to define the role of activity-induced presynaptic BMP signaling in synapse structure and function. First, we define the molecular identity of the pre- and postsynaptic signals. Because Crimpy is key for marking the presynaptic pool, we will define biochemically the role of Crimpy in BMP signal transduction. Second, we will elucidate how activity-dependent BMP signals direct synapse organization. We test the hypothesis that the Crimpy-mediated presynaptic Gbb signal is a local and acute cue instructive cue driving synapse organization. And third, we will define the downstream signaling cascade. We have exciting preliminary evidence that a novel BMP receptor transduces the activity-dependent signal. We will establish the receptor's role in the pathway and characterize novel downstream components of a non-canonical activity-dependent BMP cascade.\",\n",
       " 'OVERALL ABSTRACT Human astroviruses (HAstV) are a leading cause of infectious diarrhea. Yet, the current ?gold-standard? diagnostic test fails to detect 2/3 of the HAstV genotypes associated with human infection making it likely that HAstV infection is not only under-diagnosed, but more prevalent than appreciated. There has also been an increased appreciation that HAstV disease can range from asymptomatic to significant and even fatal systemic diseases beyond diarrhea including encephalitis and meningitis, particularly in high-risk populations suggesting that astrovirus-associated diarrheal disease is also not as straight-forward as dogma would have us believe. Yet, the role for distinct HAstV genotypes in disease is currently unknown and no studies to date have defined the host or viral factors connected with astroviral-associated diarrheal disease. Our proposed studies begin to fill this gap in knowledge by being the first work aimed at understanding HAstV-associated diarrhea: from epidemiology to basic virology. Strong preliminary studies suggest that diverse viral genotypes co-circulate in pediatric oncology patients with boys being four times more likely to be infected than girls, and that viruses isolated from patients have distinct in vitro phenotypes. Thus, the overall goals of our planned studies are to begin to understand HAstV-associated diarrhea in a novel high-risk population. Our central hypothesis is that the ability of astroviruses to cause diarrheal illness is largely mediated by their broad heterogeneity and distinct biological behaviors. To test our central hypothesis, we have proposed the following three interconnected but independent specific aims:  1. Understand the association between astrovirus infection and diarrheal disease.  2. Determine if diarrheal disease correlates with in vitro phenotypes.  3. Are there additional HAstV genotypes? We are uniquely suited to undertake this work given our expertise in astrovirus biology as well as having novel cohorts of pediatric oncology patients that are among the highest risk for having astrovirus infections with access to extensive metadata including onset/presence of diarrheal disease. Importantly, we have already demonstrated that our cohorts are infected with genotypes from all 3 clades, and now we will be able to determine their association with diarrheal disease. Intriguingly, there appears to be a sex bias with males more likely to be HAstV-positive. Extensive new genomic information will be generated that will be invaluable to many investigators. In the long term, these studies may reveal critical new information on the public health impact of viral enteric infections.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress plays a critical role in emotional memory formation. The emotional content of an experience often dictates which elements of the experience are remembered, and an important site in the brain for the formation of these emotional memories is the amygdala, particularly the basal lateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). The formation of emotional memories is caused by changes in the neural signaling in the BLA, and fear memory formation is characterized by the potentiation of excitatory synaptic circuits impacting the principal output neurons of the BLA. One means by which excitatory synaptic circuits in the BLA can be potentiated is by depressing inhibitory synaptic circuits, which leads to an increase in the excitability of the BLA neurons and a lower threshold for the long-term potentiation (LTP) of BLA excitatory circuits. Thus, the long-term depression of synaptic inhibition (LTDi) in the BLA promotes the LTP of excitatory circuits, which should increase anxiogenic output from the BLA to downstream target structures, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal neuroendocrine stress axis. Stress and the stress-induced increase in circulating glucocorticoids facilitate the anxiogenic output from the BLA, and this is mediated by intra-BLA endocannabinoid- and norepinephrine- dependent mechanisms. We have compelling preliminary evidence from patch-clamp recordings in brain slices for the induction by acute restraint stress of a form of LTDi that is mediated by rapid glucocorticoid-induced endocannabinoid depression of inhibitory transmission in the BLA. This represents, therefore, a form of stress and glucocorticoid-induced LTDi in the BLA. In this proposed project, we will distinguish the glucocorticoid and endocannabinoid mechanisms responsible for this stress-induced LTDi using pharmacological and genetic approaches, and we will determine whether stress-induced LTDi elicits anxiogenic behavior and facilitates fear memory formation by promoting LTP at excitatory synaptic circuits in the BLA. We will determine the noradrenergic mechanisms involved in the stress and glucocorticoid facilitation of anxiogenesis and fear memory formation. These studies will culminate in a fundamental understanding at the cellular level of how stress facilitates anxiogenesis and fear memory formation by inducing synaptic plasticity of inhibitory circuits in the BLA, and will provide possible cellular and molecular targts for future therapeutic intervention for the prevention and/or treatment of anxiety disorders. A potentially invaluable finding that may emerge from these studies is the identification of cannabinoid and/or noradrenergic pharmaceutical targets for the prevention of fear memory formation following exposure to trauma, when therapeutic intervention is feasible.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain organizes information about the sensory world into maps. Prominent examples are the maps of eye-preference and retinotopy in the lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus  and visual cortex. Experiments in this proposal will advance our understanding of mechanisms responsible for the development of precise neural circuitry in the mammalian brain. We will employ a broad range of techniques, including molecular biological, cell biological, neuroanatomical, electrophysiological and advanced optical imaging techniques in vitro and in vivo. We focus our experiments on maps of eye preference and retinotopy in the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus of the mouse. These structures are the dominant target of retinal projections to the brain. The lateral geniculate nucleus is the primary relay of visual information to the visual cortex, and the superior colliculu is a sensory motor structure that has emerged as an ideal model system for the examination of neural circuit development and function. It is widely hypothesized that molecular cues are responsible for the establishment of coarse map structure in the lateral geniculate and superior colliculus, and activity dependent processes subsequently refine these sensory motor circuits to functional precision. We first propose to definitively establish whether patterned spontaneous activity is necessary for the development of visual maps. We next propose to manipulate the temporal pattern of activity in the developing retina to examine the dependence of retinocollicular development of retinal ganglion cell activity. We finally propose to manipulate th spatial pattern of activity in the developing retina to examine the dependence of visual map development on the spatial character of spontaneous retinal activity. In all, the experiments in this proposal are designed to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the development of precise neural circuits in the mammalian brain, with a specific emphasis on the emergence of visual maps in the mouse superior colliculus.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this proposal is to develop an efficient and robust method to epigenetically reprogram naÃ¯ve human T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs) that can prevent graft versus host disease (GvHD). Our short term goal for Phase I of the STTR award is to demonstrate that we can epigenetically-reprogram naÃ¯ve T cells using CRISPR/Cas9-based technology into immunosuppressive cells that have the protein marker, gene expression, and epigenetic regulatory profiles of Tregs. This will motivate Phase II of the STTR, where we will test the epigenetically-reprogrammed Tregs in a humanized mouse model of graft versus host disease. The data obtained during the STTR will position the therapy for clinical trials to prevent GvHD in hematopoietic cell transplantation. There is a clinical need to improve patient outcomes in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) due to the high incidence, morbiditity, and mortality associated with GvHD. Approximately half of all HCTs utilize hematopoietic cells from unrelated donors, and approximately 26,800 patients will undergo this procedure per year worldwide. Despite improved diagnostics to match the most immunogenic antigens on the donor cells with those of the recipient, up to 70% of allogeneic HCT recipients will develop GvHD as a result of their graft. Only 50% of HCT recipients that develop GvHD survive 3 years beyond the transplant procedure. GvHD is mediated by donor T cells that recognize polymorphisms in the protein-coding genome of the graft and the recipient, and these reactive T cells can be suppressed by Tregs. We will utilize CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenetic editing tools to reprogram naÃ¯ve human T cells, which be easily collected from whole blood by apheresis or density gradient centrifugation, into immunosuppressive Tregs. We will first perform a high-throughput screens of candidate Treg- specific gene regulatory elements that we have identified through computational analysis of epigenomic data. We will then validate that these elements can be activated by CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenome modification tools that we have developed to generate T cells with the phenotype, in vitro suppressive properties, gene expression, and chromatin regulatory profile of Tregs. !',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Cancer Epigenetics: New Mechanisms, New Therapies, organized by Drs. FranÃ§ois Fuks and Anne Brunet. The conference will be held February 10- 14, 2018 in Breckenridge, Colorado. The field of epigenetics has recently emerged as an essential component of oncology research, with altered epigenetic modifications considered to be critical hallmarks of cancers. Unlike mutations, epigenetic aberrations are reversible and as a result, epigenetic therapies hold great promise as anti-cancer agents. For these novel therapies to succeed, a key challenge is to fully understand the nature and the mechanisms that lead to epigenetic changes in cancer. Another essential challenge is to make sense of the avalanche of data flowing from increasingly powerful omics-based technologies. Despite these challenges, never has the potential for scientific and clinical breakthroughs in this field been greater. Bringing together both the academic and the pharmaceutical communities, this Keystone Symposia meeting will focus on: 1) The newest findings on the mechanisms by which epigenetic pathways are established and maintained in normal and stem cells, and how these go awry during aging and cancer, with a special emphasis on histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and the unexpected increased number of DNA modifications ((hydroxy)methylcytosine and methyladenine); 2) The growing roles of noncoding RNAs in cancer and the emergence of the new and exciting realm of RNA epigenetics; 3) Use of new omics technologies to interrogate altered epigenetic landscapes in tumors and assess their clinical implications; and 4) Novel and promising therapeutic drugs aimed at reversing specific epigenetic alterations. Ultimately, the meeting will provide great opportunities for senior and junior scientists to meet the leaders in the field from both academia and industry, hence forging exciting interdisciplinary interactions and creating potential new collaborations in the booming area of cancer epigenetics.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract  The last decade has seen an explosion of interest in statistical modeling and analysis of spatiotemporally misaligned data and change-of-support problems, where different variables of scienti?c interest are observed at disparate scales making them dif?cult to be coherently modeled. This is especially relevant in environmental public health, where exposure data may be based upon data from monitoring data networks, while climate data are usually available as rasterized outputs from numerical models. The situation is further compounded by our objective of associating these factors with health outcomes (e.g. disease incidence, hospitalizations, mortality and so on), which are reported by public health sources as aggregated data over regions rather than at points. Furthermore, public health researchers today routinely encounter datasets exhibiting high-dimensional spatial misalignment or change-of-support, where ?dimension? refers to one or all of the following: (a) the number of spatial units (e.g., geographically referenced coordinates), (b) the number of temporal units (time points) at which the variables have been observed, and (c) the number of outcomes and other variables being studied. We propose a versatile collection of easily implementable and innovative Bayesian statistical methods that, in conjunction with appropriate software, will offer more comprehensive and statistically reliable mapping and analysis for misaligned spatiotemporal data in high-dimensional settings. Our methods and software will help spatial analysts to establish relationships among health outcomes and environmetal and climate-related predictors. Our dissemination efforts will deliver our methodology to a far broader audience of health and environmental researchers and administrators than is currently accessible.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary When HIV-1 is transmitted from one individual to another, a major bottleneck takes place and only one or a few viral variants establishes infection in the new individual. The study of these special transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses is important because these viruses seed new infections. Since T/F viruses are the most important targets of prevention based strategies, a deeper understanding the phenotypic properties that correlate with successful transmission is crucial. Several phenotypic features of the Env glycoprotein clearly differentiate T/F HIV-1 from those that arise during chronic infection or after lab adaptation: T/F Envs are exclusively CCR5 tropic, they have fewer glycosylation sites and shorter variable loops, and they are more resistant to neutralizing antibodies. In this proposal, I will characterize a new feature of T/F HIV-1 variants which I have discovered: T/F HIV-1 is highly specific for the CD4 receptor of humans, whereas lab adapted HIV-1 is far more promiscuous and can enter cells through the CD4 molecules of all primate species that I have tested. This distinction is important because it further supports the idea that the lab adapted viruses that we have been studying for decades may not truly be representative of viruses that are naturally transmitted during infection. The objectives of this proposal are to study the evolutionary diversity of CD4 to identify receptor requirements that are critical to the successful entry and infection of T/F HIV-1 variants. The specific aims of this research proposal are to: 1) determine the extent to which CD4 imposes selection on lentiviruses during transmission, 2) investigate post- entry interactions between primate CD4 and Nef and Vpu from T/F HIV-1, and 3) identify nonhuman primate individuals with CD4 alleles best suited for studying HIV-1 transmission and early infection. Collectively, this research will provide critical insights into how we tackle modeling T/F HIV-1 infection in nonhuman primates. In addition, it will further our understanding of the biological interactions made between T/F viruses and their hosts, as well as aid in our understanding of how lentiviruses adapted to humans during zoonosis.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) develops in about a half of all cancer patients receiving anti-neoplastic drugs, such as the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel (PTX). Because there is no effective treatment, painful CIPN is one of the most common causes of early termination of chemotherapy. We found, in time-lapse imaging studies of cultured mouse sensory neurons expressing mitochondria-targeting fluorescent protein (mitoDendra), that (i) the reduction of distal neurite mitochondrial density, emerging within 3 hours of PTX exposure, constitutes one of the earliest signs of PTX-CIPN (PCIPN) in vitro and precedes subsequent neurite degeneration; and (ii) the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), which promotes mitochondrial biogenesis via activation of peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-? coactivator (PGC) 1?, mitigates these phenotypes. In this R21 application, we will take advantage of our in vitro and in vivo PCIPN models to determine, with particular focus on the AMPK-PGC1? axis, the mechanism by which AICAR counteracts this condition. SA-I: To assess the impact of AICAR and PGC1? activation on PCIPN in vitro - AICAR acts on PGC1? via activation of AMPK, which also modulates tau and glycogen synthase kinase 3? involved in the regulation of microtubule stability and thus may affect the PCIPN phenotypes. To gain insights into the disease pathogenesis and the mechanism of action of AICAR, we will assess temporal changes of these proteins in cultured sensory neurons treated with PTX, AICAR, or both. To correlate the molecular data obtained with the PCIPN phenotypes, we will grow mitoDendra sensory neurons in a compartment culture system, which allows us to spatiotemporally evaluate changes of neurites and their mitochondria. To determine the significance of activating PGC1?, the neurons will also be treated with nicotinamide riboside, which activates PGC1? independent of AMPK. SA-II: To evaluate the therapeutic potential of AICAR and PGC1? overexpression for PCIPN in vivo - To compare therapeutic efficacy at different stages of PCIPN, AICAR or vehicle will be given before, at the time of, or after inducing PCIPN in the mice. Outcome measures will include histological and a series of nociception assays. To determine the significance of the PGC1? pathway, PCIPN in mice overexpressing PGC1? in sensory neurons under the inducible promotor will be compared with PCIPN in non-induced littermates treated with or without AICAR. Study Impact: The proposed studies will provide novel insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms and new therapeutic strategies for PCIPN. The results obtained will be advanced, in our future research, to new preclinical studies in animals, targeting more disease-specific molecules, and further elucidating the disease mechanisms. Upon in vivo validation of its efficacy and safety in our pre-clinical study, AICAR, which is readily-available as a nutritional supplement and has anti-tumor effects, would be translated rapidly to the clinic.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary Influenza A virus (IAV) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes seasonal epidemics annually and has the potential to cause worldwide pandemics. Life-threatening pneumonia occurs in only a small minority of infected individuals (0.04-0.4% of cases). Pre-existing pulmonary disease and acquired immunodeficiencies are well- known risk factors. The vast majority of severe influenza cases, however, remain unexplained, especially in children. Intriguingly, classical primary immunodeficiencies do not predispose to severe influenza. We recently reported an otherwise healthy child with severe influenza due to inherited autosomal recessive (AR) IRF7 deficiency resulting in impaired interferon (IFN)-?/? production in both plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived pulmonary epithelial cells (PECs). This was the first demonstration that influenza susceptibility could be heritable. We hypothesize that additional cases of severe influenza in children and young adults may result from single-gene inborn errors of immunity, not necessarily displaying complete penetrance. We recently performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a cohort of 25 patients and their parents (trio design) with life-threatening influenza without secondary bacterial pneumonia. We discovered a homozygous IRF9 mutation in a child with life-threatening influenza and a history of adverse reaction to MMR vaccination. IRF9, with STAT1 and STAT2, is one of the three subunits of ISGF3, the main transcriptional complex that drives antiviral type I IFN responses. The mutation is private to this kindred and affects an essential nucleotide at a splice site. We intend to test whether the mutation is deleterious, in terms of expression and function. We will also test the patient's cells for response to type I IFN and their control of influenza virus in the presence of type I IFNs. Finally, we will compare the genome-wide transcriptome responses to type I IFNs in the patient's cells with those from other patients with autosomal recessive, complete defects in IFNAR1, IFNAR2, STAT1, and STAT2. Our preliminary data are convincing and strong, as we showed that the splice mutation is not leaky and the encoded protein is loss of ISGF3 expression and function. Moreover, the patient's cells seem to control influenza virus poorly even in the presence of exogenous type I IFNs. Finally, we have collected cells from patients with all types of inborn errors of the type I IFN responsive pathway. Our project is thus highly innovative, yet supported by strong preliminary evidence. Collectively, our project will characterize, in depth, the molecular and cellular basis of a new primary immunodeficiency, autosomal recessive IRF9 deficiency, thereby documenting a second genetic and immunological etiology of severe influenza of childhood. This study will give weight to the emerging notion that severe influenza of childhood can be caused by single-gene inborn errors of immunity. Our study will also have new and important biological implications, providing the first analysis of IRF9-dependent and -independent responses to type I IFNs in humans. Overall, our discovery will have both biological and clinical implications.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract The recognition of posttranslational modifications by modular protein domains is a fundamental determinant of selectivity in signaling pathways. In particular tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation pathways are regulated by a large number of different, modular phosphotyrosine (pTyr) recognition domains such as SH2 and PTB domains that recognize pTyr and coordinate signaling events downstream of kinases. While in eukaryotes, several pTyr recognition domains have independently evolved and in humans, for example, there are more pTyr recognition domains than Tyr kinases, no pTyr recognition domains have been identified in bacteria. Yet, pTyr reader domains evolved repeatedly, are highly versatile, are highly integrated parts of phosphorylation pathways, and are nearly ubiquitous except in bacteria. Given the large networks of Tyr phosphorylation in bacteria, it appears likely that bacteria also evolved pTyr recognition domains that remain to be discovered. Here, we will test this idea by identifying pTyr-binding proteins in Mtb.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Our past research has provided considerable insight into the signals elicited through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate RhoA on astrocytes and in 1321N1 glioblastoma cells. The pathways regulated through PAR1 and S1P receptors via G?12/13 engagement include RhoA activation to increase cell proliferation, survival, and invasion-hallmarks of cancer. Our recent studies demonstrate robust activation of the transcriptional co-activators MRTF-A and YAP through RhoA signaling in glioblastoma cells, and implicate altered gene expression in proliferative and migratory responses. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate that robust transcriptional gene programs elicited through RhoA signaling are critical to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumor growth and maintenance of glioblastoma stem cells (GSC), with a long term goal of identifying new therapeutic targets for this devastating disease. Aim #1 uses the human 1321N1 glioblastoma cell line to define cellular events and identify changes in specific target genes by which GPCRs and RhoA engage transcriptional pathways that contribute to cancer-relevant cellular responses. S1P- and thrombin-induced proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, invasion and angiogenesis are assessed in WT and MRTF-A or YAP CRISPR/Cas9 KO cells. Data from RNA seq analysis are used to identify critical regulated genes, and tested for their functional importance in cellular responses. Actions of target genes on, autocrine and transcriptional pathways that amplify response to GPCRs and RhoA are considered. Aim #2 uses patient-derived glioblastoma xenografts (PDX), as a model of glioblastoma stem cells. Several PDX lines will be grown in serum free medium in vitro as neurospheres or adherent cultures and subsequently implanted as orthotopic (brain) xenografts... YAP, MRTF-A, RhoA and their downstream target genes will be knocked down using shRNA and in vitro stem cell markers, cellular responses and in vivo tumor growth assessed. Aim #3 tests the hypothesis that RhoA-mediated transcriptional signaling leads to astrocyte dedifferentiation and gliomagenesis driven by activated Ras). Proof of principle experiments examine dedifferentiation of isolated mouse astrocytes infected with lentiviruses encoding oncogenic Ras and in which molecules in the RhoA signaling pathway are genetically deleted or knocked down with shRNAs. In vivo studies of gliomagenesis are carried out by delivery of oncogenes by lentiviral infection into the hippocampus of GFAP-Cre mice followed by analysis of tumor growth, invasion, and changes in expression of target genes and stem cell markers. The overall findings from these studies should demonstrate that GPCR- and RhoA-mediated transcriptional activation can elicit genetic and functional responses that contribute to dysregulation in glioblastoma, and that RhoA signaling contributes to the oncogenic effect of established GBM tumor drivers. The health-related significance is that these findings could shift the focus of current research and clinical practice from the established disease drivers towards consideration of GPCR- and RhoA-regulated signaling pathways in GBM.',\n",
       " 'Paclitaxel is a cytoskeletal drug commonly used for the treatment of breast, lung, and ovarian cancer. Peripheral neuropathic pain (CIPN) is one of the most common and serious adverse effects experienced by cancer patients treated with paclitaxel. CIPN can be a dose-limiting factor for chemotherapy, leading to premature termination of treatment, thereby influencing survival and quality of life. Currently, no therapies have been identified that address the underlying pathogenic mechanisms such as neurodegeneration; in fact, the current symptomatic therapies are frequently ineffective in mitigating the painful symptoms of CIPN in the majority of patients. Therefore, the identification of alternative forms of therapy is a crucial medical need. The primary objective of this proposal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to paclitaxel- induced neuropathy in mice. We observed pronounced paclitaxel-induced CIPN in C57BL/6NJ strain but not in the closely related C57BL/6J substrain. Because the parental substrains are nearly genetically identical, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in an experimental F2 cross (Reduced Complexity Cross; RCC) will greatly facilitate the identification of novel genetic factors that underlie differences in CIPN behaviors. In Aim 1, we will use the RCC to map genomic regions, or QTLs, that are causally associated with susceptibility versus resilience to multiple measures of CIPN. In Aim 2, we will conduct transcriptome analysis via mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of spinal and peripheral neuronal regions in control mice and paclitaxel-treated mice from the parental male and female C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ substrains. The transcriptome in control mice will aid in identifying differentially expressed, candidate CIPN susceptibility genes underlying the QTLs . Genes that are differentially expressed as a consequence of paclitaxel will reveal changes in the transcriptome relevant to central and peripheral neuronal plasticity and the behaviors/changes that support the long-term establishment of CIPN that may be important for treatment reversal. In Aim 3, we will validate candidate quantitative trait genes and functional variants that influence susceptibility to and establishment of CIPN. These studies will provide rapid genetic and neurobiological insight into CIPN. Future studies will test for translational potential in human genetics, human experimental model systems (e.g., hIPSCs), and new potential therapeutics to combat the debilitating side effects of CIPN in cancer patients.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary In both humans and mice, natural killer (NK) cells are required for host defense against viral infection, most notably herpesvirus infections. To support viral clearance, NK cells robustly proliferate in an antigen-specific fashion, generate immunological memory, and exhibit enhanced functionality upon secondary encounter with the same virus. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these dynamic NK cell responses to infectious pathogens are incompletely defined. To address the requirements for NK cell expansion, I have examined by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) the transcriptome of virus-specific NK cells during a model of mouse cytomegalovirus infection (MCMV). By comparing highly expressed genes in proliferating NK cells during MCMV infection to those in naÃ¯ve NK cells, I have identified the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) as being enriched in MCMV-responding NK cells. Preliminary studies revealed that NK cells lacking IRF8 are impaired in their proliferative capacity, and this coincides with host susceptibility to MCMV infection. Thus, the goal of this proposal is thus to define the role of IRF8 in MCMV-specific NK cells during infection. In further preliminary studies, Zbtb32 was identified by RNA-seq as being significantly downregulated in Irf8-/- NK cells versus wild-type (WT) NK cells during MCMV-driven proliferation. This study will first examine whether IRF8 binds regulatory elements within the Zbtb32 locus by chromatin immunoprecipitation and whether overexpressing Zbtb32 in Irf8-/- NK cells, through generating novel retrogenic mice by retroviral transduction, can restore normal MCMV-driven proliferation (Aim 1). Subsequently, this study will use immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify distinct IRF8 binding partners in activated versus naÃ¯ve NK cells that may underlie the infection-specific transcriptional program of IRF8 (Aim 2). Together, these studies will shed light on how IRF8 induction promotes the generation of potent MCMV-specific NK cell responses. By advancing basic knowledge of the mechanisms governing antiviral NK cell responses, the proposed research may reveal novel strategies for manipulating NK cell responses against pathogens in the clinic.',\n",
       " 'Bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by Gram-negative bacterial pathogens are associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to the antibiotic-resistant nature of the pathogens. Infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens result in substantial health and economic impact due to the lack of effective therapeutic options. This lack of treatment options is particularly relevant for MDR Gram-negative pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, which have shown a great propensity to challenge the clinical care of patients suffering from such infections. Arrevus is developing a novel approach to addressing Gram-negative MDR infections through the use of Designer Proline-rich Antimicrobial peptide Chaperone protein inhibitors (DPCs) derived from insects, which serve as inhibitors to one of the critical bacterial proteins responsible for bacterial protein folding, DnaK. As an adjuvant therapy to current antibiotics, DPCs have the potential to provide a much-improved treatment option for MDR Gram- negative bacterial infections. Preliminary studies have displayed the potential of ARV-1501, the lead DPC, as an antibiotic potentiating agent against MDR Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Our efforts have shown that: 1) ARV-1501 via an intramuscular route is effective against MDR A. baumannii in a bacteremia model; 2) ARV-1501 enhances the activity of colistin and imipenem; 3) ARV-1501 has a favorable preliminary safety profile; and 4) ARV-1501 enhances the effects of legacy antimicrobials through a novel mechanism of action. Collectively, these data support the continued development of AVR-1501 through a Fast-Track program that is geared toward characterizing the therapeutic potential and safety profile of ARV-1501 in order to construct a target product profile (TPP). This overall goal will be met through the execution of the following aims: Phase I Specific Aims are: 1) To define the spectrum of activity of ARV-1501. 2) To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous dosing of ARV-1501 for the treatment of Gram-negative BSIs. The measures of success to advance to Phase II are 1) Identification of an optimal antibiotic for use as a co-treatment with ARV-1501 against Gram-negative pathogens; and 2) Determination of the efficacy of ARV-1501 when delivered intravenously in a Gram-negative BSI mouse model. Phase II Specific Aims are: 1) To characterize the pharmacological properties and therapeutic activity of ARV-1501. 2) To obtain a preliminary safety profile of ARV-1501. The measure of success for Phase II is to complete key pharmacological and safety assessments to craft the TPP.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Cryptosporidium (or Crypto for short) can cause life threatening opportunistic infection (OI) in AIDS patients. It is also a category B agent in the biodefense program. Currently, no drug is FDA-approved to treat cryptosporidiosis in AIDS patients, although a single drug nitazoxanide has been approved for use in immune-healthy patients. Our preliminary data have shown that triacsin C, an inhibitor against fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), could effectively inhibit C. parvum infections in vitro (e.g., IC50 = 136 nM). Most importantly, triacsin C (8-15 mg/kg/d) reduced the production of C. parvum oocysts in an acute infection mouse model by 56% - 88% with no observable toxicity to animals. These observations indicate that essential lipid metabolic enzymes could serve as novel drug targets in the parasite. The long-term goal of this translational research is to explore fatty acid metabolic enzymes as therapeutic targets against cryptosporidiosis. Because fatty acids are essential to all organisms, we hypothesize that ACS and ACC could serve as rational drug targets in Cryptosporidium. To test this hypothesis, we plan to perform experiments to achieve the following two specific aims. In aim 1, we will determine the efficacy of the ACS inhibitor triacsin C (TrC) in a chronic mouse model representing Crypto AIDS-OI. This aim is to extend the study from acute infection model to an AIDS-OI relevant chronic model. The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of TrC in mice will also be determined for establishing the relationship between the anti-Crypto efficacy and the kinetics of TrC in mouse plasma and in the lumen of the intestine. In aim 2, we will discover new chemotypes with highly improved medicinal chemistry properties by modifying triacsin C (TrC) and by high-throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries. Using two approaches here, we will increase the chance to obtain a more tractable lead compound, generate alternative leads, and diversify the lead structures. Upon completion of the proposed experiments, we expect to have generated key data, i.e., identified new lead structures with desired efficacy and medicinal chemical properties, for the next phase of ACS inhibitor development for the treatment of Crypto in AIDS patients.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT: Eliciting broad and potent HIV-specific neutralizing antibody (Nab) responses represents a holy grail of HIV vaccine efforts. To date, our understanding of the potential of the human immune system to generate such responses comes from the study of a subset of HIV-infected individuals who generate broad Nab responses as a result of a dominant monoclonal response. In contrast to the singly infected individuals who have been the topic of these previous studies, there is limited data on people who are superinfected with HIV and acquire two distinct strains of the virus from different partners. We have shown that superinfected individuals have broad Nab responses that cannot be explained by a monoclonal response to the known HIV epitopes. Our preliminary detailed study of one individual suggests that superinfection leads to a polyclonal response that results from distinct responses to the two infecting viral strains. We hypothesize that the complex dynamic between viruses in superinfection may contribute to the unique polyclonal response. To address this hypothesis, we propose to take advantage of our well-characterized cohort of superinfection, which represents the largest collection of cases identified to date. Among these individuals, we have identified several with broadly neutralizing antibody responses that do not map to a single known epitope target. We propose to isolate monoclonal antibodies from these individuals and determine the basis for the breadth of their response and whether the response is polyclonal. We will define the epitopes of the antibodies and the role that the initial and superinfecting virus played in eliciting them. We will also determine the evolutionary process that led to these responses. These studies represent a unique opportunity to understand how to elicit a polyclonal response to HIV, which may present a higher barrier to escape and resistance than a monoclonal response.',\n",
       " 'Abstract With the information we currently have available, a vaccine that prevents HIV infection outright in a substantial portion of vaccinated individuals seems out of reach. A far more realistic vaccine would be one that blunts acute viremia and, more importantly, maintains immunologic suppression of the virus for long periods of time without the aid of antiretroviral drugs. Such a vaccine should elicit potent T cell responses. The CMV vectored SIV vaccine has reinvigorated hopes that such a vaccine could be possible. One key to the success of the CMV vectored vaccine is its remarkable ability to prime and maintain CD8 T cell responses against SIV that are restricted in non-canonical fashion, specifically targeting SIV derived epitopes that are presented in the context of MHC-II and MHC-E molecules. However, it?s not clear at this time that the CMV vectored vaccine can be directly translated to HIV. Thus, more vaccine candidates are sorely needed that induce similar responses so that basic mechanistic experiments can be conducted to understand how other vaccine platforms can be made to induce similarly effective CD8 T cell responses. To this end, we have investigated a novel attenuated mutant of SIV that lacks just two amino acids in the Env cytoplasmic domain. This virus, termed ?GY, induces potent T cell responses along with no neutralizing antibodies, and protects pigtail macaques from multiple homologous and heterologous pathogenic SIVs. Remarkably, our preliminary data suggest ?GY, like CMV, elicits non-canonical CD8 T cell responses that, in vitro, can target and eliminate virus infected target cells. Here, we propose to capitalize on this phenomenon to begin to tease out these responses. To do this, we will use Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM), which, in stark contrast to pigtails, exhibit remarkably simple MHC genetics due to a population bottleneck on the island. In Aim 1, we will vaccinate MCM with ?GY and comprehensively characterize the CD8 T cell response with focus on alternately restricted T cells, including determining their molecular restriction. In Aim 2, we will assess whether these responses can protect this species of macaque from pathogenic SIVsmE660. We will also expand T cell lines and clones in vitro from the vaccinated animals and determine their capacity to eliminate diverse pathogenic challenge viruses in vitro. Together, this highly focused experimental design will allow us to begin to dissect non-canonical CD8 T cells, their restricting molecules, and their ability to protect from diverse viruses. We hope these data will lead to larger projects designed to decipher the mechanisms, perhaps shared with CMV, that lead to these highly potent alternate CD8 T cell responses.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary The microbiome and the metabolome are intricately linked with host immunity and are emerging as critical regulators of vaccine-induced immune responses. Despite their importance, we lack a fundamental understanding of their influence ? both positive and negative on HIV vaccine outcomes. Bridging this gap will complement the significant efforts directed at immunogen/adjuvant design and advance the development of an HIV vaccine that is both effective and safe. The main objective of this R03 is to delineate the role of the microbiome and metabolome in accumulation of HIV target CD4 T cells in the female genital tract (FGT) in order to understand their role in subverting vaccine efficacy. These studies will be conducted under the auspices of a parent K01-funded vaccine study evaluating immunogencity and efficacy of a DNA-Prime/Protein boost vaccine platform in rhesus macaques. In Aim 1 of this research project, we will test the hypothesis that recruitment of HIV target CD4 T cells to the lower FGT over the course of vaccination is dictated by specific vaginal bacterial communities. In Aim 2, we will determine whether distinct metabolite profiles are strongly associated with the frequency and phenotype of HIV target cells in the FGT. The ultimate goal of this R03 proposal is to determine whether a cervicovaginal microbial/metabolite composition that predisposes to vaccine induced infiltration of HIV target CD4 T cells to the FGT results in vaccine failure. By integrating cutting-edge microbiome and metabolome analysis into scheduled collection of samples alongside a comprehensive evaluation of immune responses and vaccine efficacy, the R03 will leverage existing resources to not only break new ground and open avenues for further exploration but also better inform vaccine outcomes of the parent study. The findings will provide critical preliminary data for an R01 proposal to elucidate the mechanisms by which microbiota influence HIV vaccine outcomes. The strong environment of the CNPRC and CCM, robust genomic, metabolomic, bioinformatics, and statistical support provided by UC Davis Genome Center, the strong and complementary expertise of the collaborators combined with the PIs expertise in T cell immunology, preclinical vaccine studies, micobiota analysis, and metabolism will facilitate the successful execution of the proposed studies within the 2-year timeline.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 remains the dominant mechanism by which the epidemic is sustained worldwide and increasingly is the route by which the virus is spreading within the US. It is now well established that in a majority of transmissions, infection is initiated by a single genetic variant, the transmitted founder (TF) virus, from the transmitting partner quasispecies. This severe severe genetic bottleneck, in which one or a limited number of variants from the diverse population present in the transmitting (donor) partner establish productive infection in the previously uninfected partner is the result of both stochastic and selective processes. Although we and others have shown that selection for less evolved (more ancestral) variants present in the donor?s viral quasispecies are favored during selection, the biological traits that define this enhanced transmissibility remained to be fully elucidated. In this renewal application, we are proposing 3 Specific Aims that combine cohort-level viral genetics analyses, in vitro phenotypic characterization, as well as an in vivo model for HIV-1 transmission, to define the viral properties that are advantageous during transmission. These approaches together have the potential to provide more definitive information on whether there are biological phenotypes of HIV-1 that are linked to transmission and could be targeted for intervention. Specifically we will:  1. Define specific virologic traits that correlate with the selection of more consensus-like viruses through a  broad analysis of subtype A and C transmission pairs, coupled with novel assay methodologies.  2. Characterize the nature, impact and extent of selection bias across genomic regions and subtypes using  a novel PacBio sequencing approach to define the donor quasispecies and the TF virus.  3. Determine, using humanized BLT mice, whether preferential transmission of TF viruses over donor-  matched NT viruses occurs in this model and reveals viral and host determinants of transmission. A knowledge gap remains in our understanding of the genetic bottleneck associated with HIV-1 transmission. The experiments proposed will narrow this gap by conducting a thorough interrogation of the biological characteristics of the transmitted founder virus that are linked to its preferential transmission, using an expanded panel of transmission pairs from two African cohorts and novel technologies that have not been applied in this setting. Such traits, if defined, could provide new avenues for specifically targeting prevention approaches to the viruses most likely to initiate new infections.',\n",
       " 'Racial and ethnic minority youth have poorer asthma status than Caucasian youth, even after controlling for socioeconomic variables. Proper use of asthma controller medications is critical in reducing asthma mortality and morbidity. The clinical consequences of poor asthma management include increased illness complications, excessive functional morbidity, and fatal asthma attacks. There are significant limitations in research on interventions to improve asthma management in racial minority populations, particularly minority adolescents and young adults, though illness management tends to deteriorate after adolescence during emerging adulthood, the unique developmental period beyond adolescence but before adulthood. All elements of the proposed study protocol were piloted in an NHLBI-funded pilot study (1R34HL107664-01A1 MacDonell). Results suggested feasibility and acceptability of the study protocol as well as proof of concept. We are now ready to test the intervention in a larger randomized clinical trial. The proposed study will include 192 African American emerging adults with moderate to severe persistent asthma and low controller medication adherence recruited from clinic and emergency department settings. Half of the sample will be randomized to receive a multi-component technology-based intervention (MCTI) targeting adherence to daily controller medication. The MCTI consists of two components: 1) 2 sessions of computer-delivered motivational interviewing targeting medication adherence, and 2) individualized text messaging focused on medication adherence between the sessions. Text messages will be individualized based on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). The remaining half of participants will complete a series of computer-delivered asthma education modules matched for length, location, and method of delivery of the intervention session. Control participants will also receive text messages between intervention sessions. Message content will be the same for all control participants and contain general facts about asthma (not tailored). Youth will be recruited from the Detroit Medical Center, the only university affiliated medical center in Detroit, Michigan. It is hypothesized that youth randomized to MCTI will show improvements in adherence to medication (primary outcome) and asthma control (secondary outcome) compared to the comparison condition at all post-intervention follow ups (3, 6, 9, and 12 months).',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses a neglected major problem: no effective primary prevention for anthracycline- based chemotherapeutic (Anth-bC) myocardial injury experienced during and after treatment for triple negative (estrogen, progesterone, HER-2 receptor negative) breast cancer. Today, cardiovascular (CV) events including heart failure due to myocardial injury and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction are the second leading cause of mortality in women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. We provide preliminary data indicating that myocardial injury and LV dysfunction occur early upon receipt of Anth-bC (1 to 6 months), and additional data suggesting that treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (or statins) prevents cardiac dysfunction during receipt of Anth-bC. Accordingly, we propose to conduct a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial of 40 mg per day of atorvastatin in women receiving Anth-bC for triple negative breast cancer. Our primary outcomes are acquired with an innovative form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that identifies LV dysfunction after initiation of Anth-bC. We will collect these MRI measures along with other questionnaire derived and serum measures that will provide understanding of the mechanisms by which statin therapy influences LV function. We will also monitor for the potential occurrence of side effects related to the administration of statins including diabetes, cognitive decline, myalgias and creatine kinase elevations. The study will be conducted at 6 referral sites within North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida using a permuted block enrollment design with emphasis on recruiting minority subjects. We have assembled an accomplished group of investigators with experience in the conduct of trials of patients with cancer, the administration of statins and assessing CV-related outcomes, and the utilization of innovative MRI and serum biomarkers to identify CV abnormalities in heart failure patients. Uniquely, this NHLBI proposed multi-center study will combine with efforts from the National Cancer Institute supported Wake Forest Research Base Clinical Community Oncology Program. This collaboration is attractive as it combines the investigative strengths of the NHLBI to ascertain CV disease with the existing funding from the NCI to conduct randomized clinical trials in women with breast cancer. Throughout the document, color is used to enhance the readability of Figures and Tables, and many of the additional details regarding conduct of a clinical trial are indexed within the proposal in Table 2 of the scientific plan. This study represents the first clinical trial of primary prevention to avod CV injury in women treated for breast cancer using a low-cost, widely available generic therapy. If successful, this trial will suggest a new paradigm in the management of breast cancer patients using primary prevention to attenuate the cardiotoxic effects from Anth-bC for the purpose of improving the overall long-term survival of women with breast cancer.',\n",
       " 'Project Abstract Understanding the influence of the neural efferent and afferent regulation of ?-cell health and function would be an important advancement. Although it is known that neural input plays a critical role in the health of the pancreas, details of the neuroanatomy and neurobiology of the human pancreas remains largely unexplored. It may be that T1D patients, wherein residual ?-cells continue to secrete C-peptide, could benefit from neuromodulation therapies that stimulate neurovascular regrowth and result in anti-inflammatory effects in the pancreas. Furthermore, neuromodulation therapies may help to improve insulin secretion in patients with T2D or perhaps delay onset of disease for those at high risk for T1D (e.g. first-degree relative with T1D, multiple islet autoantibodies, genetic risk factors). Both knowledge of the functional neuroanatomy and enabling technologies to test this hypothesis do not currently exist. This project brings together a potent combination of experts in islet biology, neurophysiology, bioengineering, and clinical endocrinology with an innovative approach to define the comparative neuroanatomy of the human and rat pancreatic neural network. Our hypothesis is that pancreatic ?-cells, functioning like peripheral neurons, maintain blood glucose levels, in part, due to the neural regulation of islet blood flow. This novel hypothesis will be tested by one specific aim: 1) To determine pancreatic neuroanatomy. These studies will enable understanding and mapping of the autonomic and sensory efferent and afferent networks in normal human and rat pancreas. Importantly, our studies will map the human pancreatic neural networks utilizing specimens already collected from human organ donors without diabetes and those with T1D or T2D using optical clearing methodologies and high resolution 3D microscopy. The outcomes of these studies will provide critical design data for logical application of next-generation neuromodulation technologies to improve islet health. This proposed work is directly in-line with the SPARC program to understand comparative neuroanatomy of the endocrine pancreas to enable neuromodulation strategies for amelioration of end organ diseases.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Gastrointestinal (GI) motility and defecation are absolute prerequisites for nutrient absorption, fecal elimination and overall health.  Normal GI motility, vascular perfusion, and intestinal inflammation are coordinated by vast numbers of neurons that reside within ganglia of the enteric nervous system (ENS) intrinsic to the gut wall.  While recent work has identified diverse genes that direct the initial development of progenitor cells that give rise to enteric neurons in the wall of the intestine, we know very little about the genes that are expressed in adult enteric neurons.  Consequently we are unable to determine whether efforts to generate enteric neurons produce the normal complement of cell types.  Moreover we do not fully understand how distinct types of neurons contribute to overall coordination of intestinal motility because the use of common immunohistochemical markers alone does not distinguish functionally distinct subtypes.  As a result, our abilities to target and functionally manipulate specific types of neurons in the gut are extremely limited.  To surpass these limitations, our application proposes to develop a comprehensive, single cell transcriptome map of adult enteric neurons in normal mice in parallel with deep sequencing of enteric ganglia from distinct regions of human intestine so that a global gene expression atlas of human enteric ganglia is obtained.  To capture mouse enteric neurons for single cell RNA-Seq we will use a fluorescent transgenic mouse line that we developed for live-cell imaging of enteric neurons.  Human enteric ganglia will be collected by laser capture microdissection from adult surgical remnants.  Comparison of enteric neuron expression profiles between mouse and human data sets will identify conserved genes that mark distinct neuronal subtypes. The resulting expression atlas of enteric neurons will define specific molecular fingerprints for discrete neuron subtypes that are essential to pursue targeted, functional manipulation of GI motility in distinct regions of the intestine.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using current guidelines, only one-quarter of patients receiving an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) receive appropriate ICD therapy within 5 years. PAREPET (Prediction of ARrhythmic Events with Positron Emission Tomography) identified four independent risk factors that predict SCA or ICD equivalent (SCAE) in subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy. At optimized cut-points, the absence of these risk factors identified 38% of the cohort at very low risk of SCAE (<1%/yr). This is actually lower than the SCA rate for patients with coronary disease and mild left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (1.5-2%/yr) who are not candidates for an ICD. Thus, our goal is to prospectively determine whether these risk factors can identify a subgroup at low enough risk of SCAE to have an ICD safely withheld.  PAREPET confirmed that denervated myocardium quantified with 11C-meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED) PET could predict time to SCAE. A post-hoc multivariate analysis subsequently determined that among those on optimal medical therapy, denervated myocardium, LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) were the only independent predictors of SCAE. These parameters were independent of other PET, clinical, and demographic variables including infarct size, ejection fraction, and functional class. However, before proposing a very large clinical tria to test the potential for withholding ICD therapy among subjects predicted to be at low risk, a number of important details must be established. First, in PAREPET LVEDVI and BNP were found to be complementary to denervated myocardium based on a retrospective analysis. Thus, the independence and significance of these variables requires prospective validation. Second, HED uses a short half-life isotope that is ideal for limiting radiation exposure but requires local synthesis including a cyclotron. Clinical translation will therefore require a longer lived isotope that can be regionally produced. Finally, potentially withholding ICD therapy will require an approach for dynamic risk assessment in order to identify subsequent changes in risk. These issues will be addressed with the following Specific Aims:  In subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy on optimal medical therapy who receive an ICD for the primary prevention of SCA: Specific Aim #1 - prospectively validate whether LVEDVI and/or BNP are significant predictors of SCAE and are independent of denervated myocardium. Specific Aim #2 - determine if the 18F-labeled norepinephrine analog LMI1195 can reliably quantify denervated myocardium. Specific Aim #3 - determine whether repeat testing after a cardiac hospitalization predicts an increased risk of SCAE.  This proposal will provide preliminary data for a prospective trial to test whether primary prevention ICDs can be safely withheld in subjects predicted to be at very low risk of SCAE, with cardiac hospitalizations expected provide a warning signal to reassess risk. Such a strategy would not only improve the alignment of device costs and complications with potential ICD benefit, but would almost certainly be cost-effective.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSRACT Obesity is epidemic and ~50% of the United States population has diabetes or prediabetes. Furthermore, death rates from all causes are ~1.5 times greater for individuals with versus without diagnosed diabetes and the economic cost of diabetes in the US was $245 billion in 2012. Thus, diabetes and associated metabolic diseases represent major public health and economic burdens. Short nightly sleep duration and untreated sleep disorders are now recognized as risk factors for metabolic diseases with more than 50% of Americans sleeping less than the recommended 7 hours/night, and sleep and wakefulness disorders impacting 50 to 70 million Americans. However, the biochemical mechanisms by which sleep loss contributes to metabolic disease are largely unknown, impeding the development of novel and effective countermeasures that target the negative metabolic consequences of sleep loss. Furthermore, it is unknown if the common and self-selected countermeasure of weekend recovery sleep attenuates the negative metabolic consequences of sleep loss. As such, I propose to identify the influence of insufficient sleep on mechanisms underlying metabolic dysregulation and determine the impact of ?weekend recovery? sleep on these mechanisms. The proposed project will utilize metabolomics to analyze plasma samples from an ongoing in-laboratory study investigating insulin sensitivity and energy balance during insufficient sleep followed by weekend recovery sleep. Guided by my preliminary research efforts, I will use targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches to identify metabolites and metabolic pathways impacted by insufficient sleep and weekend recovery sleep. Additionally, the untargeted discovery approach may identify potential ?biomarkers? that change with sleep loss and ?weekend recovery? sleep. My proposed findings will help inform future validation and sleep countermeasure investigations including testing at risk populations (i.e. obesity, pre-diabetes, shift-workers). This proposed F32-award is responsive to a key goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan to ?enable sleep and circadian research training to inform science in cross-cutting domains, accelerate the pace of discovery, and the translation of enhanced therapies from bench to bedside to community?, and is designed to advance my training in sleep and circadian physiology and metabolomics to strengthen my potential for a successful NIH Career Development K-award.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Traumatic brain injury (TBI) impacts nearly 2% of the population and is a major cause of disability in the Veteran population, often resulting in long-term physical, cognitive and neurobehavioral impairments that prevent return to the workforce and community. It has long been appreciated that poor sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness are common and persistent symptoms after mild TBI. Data suggests that poor sleep interferes with recovery from TBI. What is not known is why sleep-wake disturbances persist after TBI. More effective therapies are needed for the treatment of TBI and associated post-concussive symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand mechanisms underlying sleep-wake disturbances in order to identify better therapeutic targets.  Our long-term goal is to understand why sleep-wake disturbances persist after mild TBI. Our central hypothesis is that TBI disrupts physiological cortical function which in turn alters glutamatergic inputs to hypothalamic sleep-wake circuits, resulting in sleep-wake fragmentation, and subsequently delaying cognitive recovery in individuals with TBI. Our hypothesis was formulated on the basis of our own preliminary data showing decreased excitability of hypothalamic wake-active neurons in a mouse model of TBI, and improved wakefulness with administration of a dietary therapy that is thought to increase synaptic glutamate content. The rationale for the proposed research is that, once it is known how changes in brain glutamate cause sleep-wake fragmentation in TBI, pharmacological manipulation of glutamate in sleep-wake circuits could yield novel approaches for recovery from TBI.  We plan to test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims:  1. Characterize regional patterns of sleep-wake dysfunction in TBI.  2. Assess glutamate and GABA changes during sleep and wakefulness in TBI.  3. Examine the effect of a dietary therapy on glutamate, GABA, and regional sleep-wake  dysfunction in TBI.  To accomplish these aims, we will first perform chronic, in vivo electrophysiological recordings across different cortical brin regions in freely behaving, brain-injured mice, analyze quantitative EEG measures in sleep and wakefulness, and correlate these metrics with behavior. Next, we will perform in vivo microdialysis in combination with EEG in brain-injured mice to determine extracellular glutamate and GABA levels in the hypothalamus during sleep and wake states. We will then use quantitative electron microscopy (EM) to confirm synaptic changes in glutamate and GABA in the hypothalamus. Lastly, given the hypothesis that our dietary therapy replenishes glutamate content in nerve terminal inputs onto wake-active neurons in the hypothalamus, dietary therapy will be administered to brain- injured mice to determine the recovery of extracellular glutamate and GABA (microdialysis), synaptic glutamate and GABA (EM), and sleep-wake measures (EEG).  With respect to expected outcomes, the work proposed in aims 1, 2 and 3 is expected to identify quantitative EEG metrics of sleep-wake dysfunction in TBI that predict functional recovery, and examine excitatory and inhibitory inputs to sleep-wake circuits in TBI that are amenable to therapeutic intervention. Such results are expected to have a profound impact on our understanding of TBI and post-concussive symptoms, by deepening our understanding of cortico-hypothalamic interactions in TBI-induced sleep-wake disturbances, and evaluating a therapy that has enormous potential to optimize wakefulness, and therefore recovery, from TBI.',\n",
       " 'Liver failure is characterized by a loss of hepatocytes or hepatic function due to an acute liver insult or chronic liver disease. Liver failure is often accompanied by neurological complications, called hepatic encephalopathy, which lead to reduced quality of life and increased mortality in patients. Acute liver failure is characterized by hepatocyte necrosis that occurs at a rate that is too rapid for the liver to regenerate resulting in a loss of liver function. In contrast, chronic liver diseases are characterized with progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis that can generate liver failure as hepatocyte death occurs and hepatic regeneration is impaired due to aberrant cellular processes. During chronic liver disease, transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF?1) has been well classified as a factor involved with apoptosis, inflammation and liver fibrosis and therefore contributes to the progression of liver pathology. We recently demonstrated that TGF?1 also contributes to the pathogenesis of both acute liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy and that this signaling protein promotes increased endothelial cell permeability following acute liver injury. Unfortunately attempts to develop therapeutics that target TGF? signaling have failed clinical trials. Therefore, targeting proteins involved in activating TGF?1 and/or proteins that interact with TGF?1 signaling may prove to be better tolerated by patients. Taking this approach, the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a homotrimeric glycoprotein that activates the propeptide form of TGF?1, and determine its contribution to pathology associated with acute and chronic liver failure. TSP-1 has been found to facilitate liver fibrosis through its interactions with TGF?1, though its actions during acute liver injury are not well classified. Our proposed specific aims will address two central hypotheses: (1) The hepatic expression of TSP-1 is elevated during acute liver failure leading to TGF?1 activation which drives hepatic inflammation, apoptosis, increased mortality and the development of hepatic encephalopathy; (2) Chronic liver failure is characterized by TGF?1 activation via TSP-1 which increases hepatic inflammation, fibrosis and other pathological processes associated with chronic liver disease. In this proposal, the pathogenesis of acute liver failure will be studied using a hepatocyte cell culture model as well as the azoxymethane-induced and acetaminophen-induced models of acute liver failure in mice. Chronic liver failure studies will employ rats that have undergone bile duct ligation surgery, a model of cholestasis and chronic biliary fibrosis with specific experiments targeted to assess cell-cell interactions in the liver. At the completion of this project, we expect to have determined the role of TSP-1 signaling on the pathological mechanisms involved with acute liver failure and chronic liver disease and will also determine the role of this signaling pathway in the development of hepatic encephalopathy. This will not only provide a greater classification of TSP-1 signaling during hepatic diseases, but could be used to identify potential therapeutic targets in patients.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the mechanistic and genetic basis for the Mre11 complex's role in the suppression of malignancy. Using yeast and mouse models, it focuses primarily on DNA repair and DNA damage signaling alterations imparted by alleles of RAD50 that affect the coiled-coil and hook domains of the protein. We the mutants derived in this effort are separations of function that will allow us to define the role of particuar Mre11 complex-dependent mechanisms meiosis, DNA repair, and the suppression of tumorigenesis. The governing hypothesis of this proposal is that the Mre11 complex suppresses tumorigenesis through its effect on chromosome integrity in addition to its influence on DNA damage signaling. We propose a series of experiments in mice and yeast to address the cancer preventing functions of the complex. First, we investigate the importance of recruitment of DNA repair factors by the Mre11 complex. Second, we examine the effect of mutations within the Rad50 hook domain on NHEJ and HR. Third, we integrate the knowledge gained in the first two Aims for the analysis of new mouse models for Rad50 dysfunction that selectively impair NHEJ. Genetic interactions with these mice and mice mutants in p53, ATM and PTEN will be examined to test the hypothesis that chromosome instability in Rad50 mutants will increase the penetrance of mutations affecting these tumor suppressor proteins and predispose to cancer.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to NHLBI TOSI HL-131: Exposure of the developing lung to cigarette smoke is an independent risk factor for the development of chronic lung disease (CLD), including asthma in later life. Even more importantly, recently, it has been shown that by altering specific developmental signaling pathways necessary for fetal lung development, the perinatal nicotine exposure-related CLD risk is not restricted only to the nicotine exposed offspring, but is also transmitted transgenerationally to the progeny of the subsequent non-exposed offspring (Rehan et al, AJP Lung; 2013;305:L501-7). Specifically, nicotine alters the normal differentiation of mesenchymal cells in the developing lung by stimulating the Wnt pathway, inhibiting PPAR? signaling, resulting in the myogenic phenotype of the airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. Interestingly, these effects are sex-specific, with the molecular and functional effects on ASM cells seen exclusively in males. Importantly, PPAR? agonists, which are potent Wnt antagonists, can inhibit and/or reverse these effects. Hypothesizing that these effects are determined by nicotine-induced epigenetic changes in the gonadal germ line, which lead to lung specific molecular and functional effects, we propose to examine the mechanistic basis for the 1) transgenerational (TG) transmission, and 2) gender-specificity of perinatal nicotine exposure-induced offspring lung hyperresponsive phenotype. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the perinatal nicotine exposure-induced lung phenotype is transmitted via the male vs. female germline (Aim 1A), whether it is affected by the genetic diversity of parents (Aim 1B), and whether the lung phenotype seen in childhood is also seen in adulthood (Aim 1C). In Aim 2, we will determine whether the more pronounced perinatal nicotine exposure-induced pulmonary phenotype seen in males is determined by the differential PKC expression and activation in ASM cells of males vs. females (Aim 2A) and whether this is abrogated by blocking the specific PKC isoform involved (Aim 2B). In Aim 3, we will determine whether perinatal nicotine exposure-induced germ line and ASM epigenetic changes are transmitted from F1 to F3 generation (Aim 3A) and whether concomitant suppression of nicotine-induced Wnt activation, using PPAR? agonist rosiglitazone, blocks these epigenetic changes and protects against perinatal nicotine-induced TG transmission of the lung myogenic phenotype (Aim 3B). The concepts put forward in this proposal are totally novel and innovative, thus advancing the field significantly by addressing the fundamental mechanism(s) that explain the detrimental effects of maternal smoking not only on the exposed offspring, but also on the many generations that follow. Using this comprehensive cell-molecular-epigenetic approach, the proposed studies are likely to not only generate new, pivotal molecular data that could significantly impact our understanding of the pathogenesis of CLD, but also provide novel mechanistic information underlying CLD risk, paving the way for studying molecular mechanisms underlying TG effects on a host of other environmental exposures.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are powerful anti-diabetic drugs whose use in treating type 2 diabetes is limited by adverse side effects. The goal of this proposal is a biochemical investigation into a mechanism that separates the positive metabolic effects of TZDs from their side effects, making it possible to design a better class of agents. PPAR?, the molecular target of the TZDs, is a key regulator of systemic insulin sensitivity, adipogenesis, inflammation, and energy homeostasis. In adipose tissue, phosphorylation of PPAR? at serine 273 (S273) is observed shortly after the initiation of high fat diet feeding and increases with progressive obesity. This phosphorylation correlates with dysregulation of PPAR? target genes, such as decreased expression of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin. ERK is the primary kinase responsible for phosphorylating PPAR? S273, inhibitors of the MEK/ERK kinase pathway block PPAR? S273 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, MEK/ERK inhibitors had potent anti-diabetic effects in obese mice demonstrating markedly improved glucose homeostasis. Similarly, high-affinity ligands of PPAR??which lack the capacity to promote adipogenesis but still block S273 phosphorylation retain anti-diabetic effects. These two pharmacological interventions blocking PPAR? S273 phosphorylation both promote improved peripheral metabolic homeostasis like the TZDs while also appearing safer as they do not trigger the side effects associated with TZDs. Our hypothesis is that ERK-mediated phosphorylation of PPAR? in obesity and inflammation causes altered impaired glucose homeostasis by targeting adipose tissue transcriptional regulation. We will test this hypothesis using a novel genetically modified mouse where PPAR? cannot be phosphorylated on S273 (S273A). Our preliminary data suggest that blocking this phosphorylation is sufficient to improve insulin sensitivity in obesity. In this proposal we will utilize three approaches to understand the contribution of PPAR? phosphorylation to the pathogenesis of obesity. In Aim 1, we will interrogate the effects of PPAR? S273 phosphorylation on glucose homeostasis and the ability of PPAR? S273A mice to respond to PPAR? ligands. In Aim 2, we will investigate the relative contribution of blocking S273 phosphorylation in the immune system to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. In Aim 3, we will examine the genome-wide set of mRNA transcripts regulated and cis-regulatory elements bound to either wild-type PPAR? or phosphorylation independent S273A PPAR?. Understanding how obesity and inflammation modulates PPAR? by ERK- mediated phosphorylation will be important for the future design of new therapeutic molecules.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 2, 3, 7, 8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent, lipophilic environmental contaminant that exerts toxicity through binding the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). The overall goal of this research is to understand how exposure to TCDD and other AhR agonists disrupts development of the forebrain and cerebral vasculature and, ultimately, how AhR agonist exposure may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive impairment. My preliminary data suggest that early embryonic exposure to TCDD severely disrupts the development of the forebrain and associated cerebral vasculature in zebrafish. The genetic and molecular tools available in zebrafish make it an excellent model for studying neurovascular development and toxicity. However, relatively few studies have used the zebrafish model to examine how TCDD-induced activation of Ahr2 impacts brain and cerebral vascular development. In Aim 1, using confocal microscopy, fluorescent- immunohistochemistry (F-IHC) and Olympus software, the candidate will create 3D reconstructions of TCDD-exposed and control brains for a detailed analysis and quantification of forebrain phenotypes. TCDD-induced changes in the cerebral vasculature will be quantified using AngioTool software. In addition, the candidate will use exciting new imaging technology to examine cerebral vascular development in vivo, which will provide unique insight into how TCDD-induced phenotypes emerge. In Aim 2, the candidate will manipulate Ahr2 activity in a cell-type specific manner to determine if activation of Ahr2 in either vascular endothelial cells or differentiated neurons is sufficient to produce the observed forebrain and cerebral vascular phenotypes. Downregulation of the transcription factor, sox9b, has emerged as a common mechanism mediating TCDD-induced toxicity in the heart, jaw and fin. Preliminary data indicates sox9b expression in the forebrain is downregulated following TCDD exposure and that loss of sox9b results in forebrain and cerebral vascular phenotypes that resemble TCDD-induced forebrain and cerebral vascular phenotypes. In Aim 3, the candidate will determine if sox9b is also a TCDD target in the developing brain and elucidate sox9b function(s) in the development of the forebrain and cerebral vasculature. Importantly, the proposed research will help us understand how AhR activation disrupts neurovascular development and when neurovascular phenotypes emerge during development. This information is essential for understanding potential risks associated with human AhR agonist exposure. The brain is a metabolically intense organ that is highly dependent on proper and continuous cerebral vascularization for normal function. Consequently, this work is relevant not only to embryonic development, but also later life stages. As a K award recipient, the candidate will follow a training plan that outlines very specific research and career development milestones to be reached over the course of the award. To augment my research background in Neuroscience, Developmental Genetics, and Cardiovascular Toxicology, my research aims are coupled with didactic coursework and hands-on training in Neurovascular Biology, Molecular Biology and Neurotoxicology. The activities outlined in this training application will provide me with training in areas needed for a successfu research career including grantsmanship, project design, and laboratory management. A committee composed of an outstanding team of scientists has been assembled is committed to the candidate and her success and are willing to play an active role in facilitating my growth as a scientist. The University of Wisconsin is a top-tier research institute with numerous NIH-sponsored training programs, core facilities, and outstanding researchers, which makes it an ideal training environment for me to develop as an independent scientist. Ultimately, the training in my research and career development plan, my interactions with my mentors, committee members and consultants, and my outstanding training environment will provide an excellent foundation for a successful academic career at a research intensive academic institution.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human eye sends information to the brain at an estimated rate of about 10 megabits per second, roughly the speed of an ethernet connection. Processing such a large bandwidth stream of visual information on behaviorally relevant time scales requires that neurons extract and represent information from visual signals efficiently, i.e represent the most information for the least cost in time and energy. In essence, the brain needs to compress the visual stream much the same way software compresses the digital representation of a movie. Little is known about how the brain accomplishes this critical task. We propose to investigate the neural mechanisms that extrastriate visual cortex uses to encode motion information in single neurons, populations, and in pursuit eye movement behavior. Neurons in area MT respond selectively to visual motion and provide the visual inputs for smooth pursuit eye movements. By recording neural and behavioral responses together, we can determine not only how cortical neurons compress incoming visual signals to represent them efficiently but also whether those coding strategies are important for behavioral performance. We will build on that paradigm to study how MT neurons jointly encode motion information, guided by recent work in the retina demonstrating enhanced stimulus compression by neural populations. The general aim of the proposed research is to determine how dynamic visual motion stimuli are represented in a cortical neuronal population and how efficiently that sensory information is subsequently read out to generate pursuit. The long-term goal is to determine how the brain represents dynamic sensory information and decodes the cues for behavior under natural conditions. This project could have a profound impact on our understanding of how the brain processes stimuli under natural conditions and for how we conceptualize sensory processing. The study will aid the development of software for retinal prosthetics that will remediate deficits in central visual processing by elucidating how the brain encodes moving scenes. Our Aims are to study (1) the Efficient sensory coding of dynamic motion stimuli in cortical area MT and pursuit. An adaptive sensory code maximizes information transfer by adjusting sensitivity and integration time to the current stimulus conditions. We will test the hypothesis that MT neurons adaptively encode motion, and that their coding efficiency impacts pursuit performance while the eyes are in flight. In natural moving scenes, fluctuations in motion are correlated across many time scales. We will measure the compression efficiency in MT firing and pursuit tracking of naturalistic motion by computing the mutual information between present response and future stimulus. Our second Aim (2) is to Quantify dynamic MT population encoding of motion inputs for pursuit. We will use the precision of pursuit as a benchmark to constrain models of cortical population coding, dissecting the contribution of patterns of spikes and silences -- across time and across populations of MT neurons -- to the encoding of target motion and to measure the size of the coding pool.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing the influence of pollutants on genome function is essential in defining their impact on human health. Arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental toxic metalloid that leads to carcinogenesis. The World Health Organization estimates that over 100 million people worldwide are at risk to drinking arsenic contaminated water. Recent studies indicate that arsenic alters gene expression leading to tumorigenesis. Proper gene regulation is essential for normal growth, development and etiology of diseases such as cancer. Eukaryotic DNA stored as chromatin whose basic repeating unit is the nucleosome, plays an integral role in gene regulation. Previously, we (and others) showed that nucleosome locations within promoters play critical roles in chromatin accessibility, thus controlling gene activity. Consequently, chromatin accessibility is an essential component in gene regulation yet is not fully understood. Chromatin accessibility appears to be modulated by several key epigenetic factors: histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), DNA methylation, nucleosome position/occupancy, transcription factors and chromatin architectural proteins (CAPs). Recent studies now indicate that changes in DNA methylation and histone PTMs influence gene expression in response to arsenic: Thus it is critically important to understand how these key epigenetic modulators integrate and interrelate to regulate the chromatin state and gene expression during arsenic exposure. This project will determine the functional changes in gene regulation, chromatin composition, structure and dynamics genome-wide due to arsenic in normal and iAs- transformed cells. We hypothesize that iAs-induced alterations in nucleosome position and occupancy, histone PTMs, and CAP occupancy all combine to dynamically restructure chromatin resulting in differential expression of key genes resulting in a failure to ensure proper gene regulation and cancer. We propose in this application the following Specific Aims: (1) determine the effect of iAs on in vivo nucleosome positioning and/occupancy during iAs-induced transformation. (2) Determine the impact of iAs- triggered modulation of CAPs-chromatin structure to impact gene expression. (3) Determine the mechanisms whereby iAs-provoked changes in chromatin composition, structure and dynamics control TF occupancy. Our interdisciplinary, broad approach will establish unique comprehensive functional and mechanistic data that will provide a detailed understanding of the interplay between arsenic-induced epigenetic changes and chromatin in the mammalian cell. We have developed novel systems that will provide an unprecedented and unique opportunity to discover the functional and mechanistic roles of the epigenome in toxin-induced diseases.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.',\n",

       " 'Project Summary  Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying genomic instability and tumorigenesis is the long-term goal of my laboratory. The broad objective, of this proposal, reflects our pursuit to gain a comprehensive understanding of the network involved in DNA repair and to determine how these proteins and pathways intersect, interact, communicate, coordinate, and collaborate for genome maintenance. The short-term goal is to perform detailed mechanistic studies of several DNA damage signaling and repair pathways, which will provide the foundation to achieve our long-term goal of exploiting DNA repair network for cancer therapy.  This proposal will define two overlapping DNA damage-signaling pathways that together are essential for cell survival. We and other researchers have constructed an elaborate signaling pathway that acts downstream of H2AX and regulates the recruitment and accumulation of many DNA damage repair proteins at sites of DNA breaks. This H2AX-dependent pathway is composed of H2AX, MDC1, RNF8, and RNF168. However, repair defects observed in H2AX-, MDC1-, RNF8-, or RNF168-deficient cells or mice are mild, raising the possibility that there is an H2AX-independent mechanism involved in the recruitment of these downstream repair proteins. We propose that this H2AX-independent pathway is controlled by NBS1.  On the basis of our previous studies and preliminary data presented in this proposal, we hypothesize that the H2AX- and NBS1-dependent pathways are involved in the DNA damage response and are critical for cell survival. We believe that these two pathways have redundant functions, especially in promoting homologous recombination repair. However, they are not completely separate, since they intersect at multiple points. This makes it considerably challenging for us to delineate the functions of these two redundant pathways. It is unknown whether we can elucidate the contribution of a single pathway to the ever-growing network, i.e., can we untangle the network to understand the mechanisms by which different pathways intersect and contribute to biological processes? We will address this question in this application and we will further study the mechanisms by which the H2AX- and NBS1-dependent pathways act together to ensure cell survival and the completion of DNA repair. We propose the following specific aims: 1) determine whether NBS1 acts redundantly with the established H2AX-MDC1-RNF8-RNF168 pathway to ensure cell survival; 2) delineate the NBS1-dependent pathway; and 3) explore the mechanisms underlying cell lethality caused by NBS1 and H2AX co-depletion. These studies will not only allow us to understand the redundant functions of H2AX and NBS1 in vivo but will also reveal ways to investigate the functions of proteins and pathways in today?s complex signaling networks. Moreover, results from these studies will provide the rationale for exploiting DNA repair defect and applying synthetic lethality concept in precision medicine for cancer patients.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  Development of the retina begins with the specification of retinal progenitor cells in the anterior neuroectoderm. The first morphological sign of this specification is the formation of two lateral grooves in the anterior neuroectoderm called the optic sulci. The cells of the optic sulci evaginate and form the optic vesicle. The distal portion of the optic vesicle will form the neuroretina and retina pigment epithelium, while the proximal portion will develop into the optic stalk. Our long-term goal is to identify developmental steps and molecular events necessary for the formation of the retina. The primary focus of our research is the role and mechanism of action of the homeobox gene Rx, a gene that appears to be at the top of the vertebrate retina-forming gene network.  Rx encodes a transcription factor and mutations in this gene cause abnormal retinal development in all vertebrates investigated to date. The absence of Rx function leads to the absence of eye formation in mice and humans. We have shown previously that Rx activity is required cell-autonomously for the formation of the neuroretina, retina pigment epithelium and the distal optic stalk. How Rx functions at the molecular level is not yet fully understood. It is not known which proteins interact with Rx and which genes mediate its function. It is the goal of this project to determine the mode of action of Rx during retinal development. To better understand how Rx regulates retinal development and why mutations in this gene lead to such dramatic eye phenotypes, in Specific Aim 1 we will identify proteins that physically interact with Rx during retinal formation using genetically modified mice. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify direct target genes of Rx by chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with sequencing.  This research will lead to a better understanding of retinal development, as this gene regulates the earliest critical steps in retinal formation. Furthermore, since mutations in this gene cause abnormal vertebrate eye development, this research will lead to the better diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the eye in which the components of the Rx regulatory network are mutated.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract  Oxysterols, the oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, have been identified for several decades, however, their roles in the physiology and pathological processes, particularly in nervous system, are largely unknown. Our previous study showed that the major cholesterol metabolite, cholestane-3?, 5?, 6?-triol (Triol), functions as an important endogenous neuroprotectant. Here, we hypothesize that blockade of acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) 1a serves as a novel mechanism underlying its neuroprotective effect, based on the following arguments and preliminary data: (1) The concentration of Triol increases after ischemic preconditioning (IPC), which contributes to IPC mediated neuroprotection; (2) The activation of calcium permeable ASIC1a exacerbates ischemic injury, and that pharmacological blockade or knockout of ASIC1a produces a significant protection; (3) In brain ischemia, blockade of ASIC1a has a therapeutic time window of ~5h, which is close to that of Triol (> 4h); (4) Our preliminary data clearly demonstrated that Triol significantly inhibits ASIC1a currents as well as its surface expression, at a concentration that occurs during ischemic preconditioning; (5) The preliminary data suggest that the inhibition of ASIC is specific to Triol, as its precursor cholesterol has no effect on ASIC currents. To rigorously test the hypothesis that Triol functions as an endogenous neuroprotectant through blockade of ASIC1a, the following specific aims will be examined: Aim 1. Determine the effect of Triol on ASIC current and calcium entry. Aim 2. Determine the inhibitory effect of Triol on ASIC1a surface expression. Aim 3. Determine whether the neuroprotection caused by Triol is mediated through inhibition of ASIC1a. Aim 4. Study the structure-activity relationship, and identify the amino acids that mediate the inhibitory effect of Triol on ASIC1a.',\n",
       " 'OVERALL ? PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of the ENCORE (Encyclopedia of RNA Elements) Consortium is to develop a foundational, functional map of protein-RNA interactions of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) encoded in the human genome, and the RNA elements they bind to across the transcriptome. These RNA elements, when expressed, form the basis of co- and post-transcriptional regulation of human genes. Our strategy consists of developing and integrating a physical map of 300 RBPs in two different human cell lines with transcriptome-wide measurements of the effects of depleting these RBPs, their localization patterns and their binding preferences independent of co-factor associations. Over the past 4 years, our consortium (Burge, Graveley, Lecuyer and Yeo) has established highly efficient data production workflows of experimental methods (RNA bind-n-seq, RNA-seq, Localization and enhanced CLIP) that will enable us to immediately expand these datasets, which form a crucial and missing link to decipher the mechanisms of post-trancriptional regulation and how these impact genetic variation and disease etiology. When combined with the data we generated over the past four years, these efforts will culminate in a comprehensive map of the functional RNA elements recognized by essentially all RBPs expressed in two human cell lines, representing approximately half of the known complement of human RBPs. ENCORE will (1) generate and validate a physical resource of cell lines expressing epitope-tagged RBPs, (2) develop transcriptomics and imaging databases of these RBPs to provide simple interfaces for the community to mine this resource, (3) develop and distribute workflows for integrative analyses and shareable results from these workflows and (4) provide training and outreach to establish ENCORE annotations as the standard reference for co- and post-transcriptional research and clinical genomics efforts in the long-term.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overarching goal is to discover the genetic and genomic mechanisms underlying behavioral predisposition and development of addiction. Addiction remains a substantial worldwide social and economic burden despite extensive efforts to curb drug availability and use. The high heritability of drug addiction, especially for cocaine, indicates that the propensity to develop a substance use disorder after initial exposure is genetically influenced. Both human and animal studies indicate that behavioral traits such as novelty seeking and novelty preference are strongly correlated with the propensity to develop a substance use disorder, but the biological basis of this relationship is unknown. We propose to identify biological mechanisms of addiction and predisposing behavior by harnessing recent advances in mouse genetic resources, including the high-precision Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population, validation in genetically modified mice, gene expression quantitation through RNA sequence analysis, and computational and statistical methods in systems genetics. In Aim 1 we will identify genetic mechanisms underlying predisposing novelty-related traits and drug self-administration through quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in a large set of DO mice. The most compelling and tractable of these will be validated in gene targeted mouse models. The intravenous drug-self administration (IVSA) paradigm, considered the gold standard for the assessment of addiction in preclinical research will enable quantification of the core features of addiction including compulsive drug use, difficulty limiting drug intake, and an extremely high motivation to take the drug. In Aim 2 we will quantify gene expression genetic variation, map expression QTLs and identify genetic correlates of predisposing behavior using RNAseq in a drug-naÃ¯ve subset of DO mice, and disseminate these results through widely used informatics resources. Gene expression analysis in drug-naÃ¯ve mice enables separation of the biological substrates of predisposition to addiction from the biological sequelae of drug exposure. By using RNA sequencing, we will be able to quantify isoforms and allelic variants in the face of genetic diversity. In Aim 3, we will address the fundamental problem of relating genetic variation in gene expression in drug-naÃ¯ve individuals to genetic variation in drug self-administration behavior by utilizing predisposing behavioral traits as a reference. This will be accomplished through the use of multivariate statistical methods in an approach we term reference trait genetics. This strategy makes use of a common collection of phenotypes to relate disparate and incompatible measures across two independent sets of mice. Development of this technique in the context of addiction research will extend the application of outbred populations to a wide range of applications in health and disease. Each aim will independently deliver basic research results and resources of interest to addiction biologists, including gene expression QTLs, addiction related genetic loci, and expression correlates of addiction related behavior. Synergy among the aims will reveal networks from polymorphism to addiction related behavior.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Deficits in motivation and pleasure, together referred to as anhedonia, are implicated in a number of psychiatric illnesses, including mood and anxiety disorders, substance-use disorders, schizophrenia, and attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder. As a result, constructs related to anhedonia are central to the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project. Anhedonia is often one of the most difficult psychiatric symptoms to treat and thus represents a critical endophenotype and vulnerability factor for a range of psychiatric disorders. Given the centrality of anhedonia to a large number of psychiatric disorders, improved interventions to treat motivation and pleasure are critical for these disorders. The overall goal of this R61/R33 project is to develop a novel transdiagnostic treatment for anhedonia, called Behavioral Activation Treatment for Anhedonia (BATA). This new intervention is designed to treat anhedonia by emphasizing supported engagement with personally relevant goals and reducing avoidance behaviors. Consistent with the objectives and milestones outlined in RFA-MH-16-406 (?Exploratory Clinical Trials of Novel Interventions for Mental Disorders?), in the R61 phase of this trial we propose to use an experimental therapeutics approach to first evaluate mesocorticolimbic target engagement by this treatment in a transdiagnostic sample characterized by clinically impairing anhedonia (Aim 1). Specifically, we will examine the effects of this treatment, relative to an active comparison treatment, on caudate nucleus activation during reward anticipation and rostral anterior cingulate cortex activation during reward outcomes using ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging. In this phase of the project, we will also use fMRI to determine the optimal dose of the intervention (Aim 2). If quantitative milestones for target engagement are achieved, in the R33 phase of this proposal we plan to evaluate the effects of the optimal does of this new treatment, versus an active comparison treatment, on anhedonic symptoms and functional outcomes (Aim 3), behavioral indicators of reward sensitivity (Aim 4), and neural indicators of reward processing (Aim 5). If hypotheses are supported, the results of this project will change real-world clinical practice given that there are currently no empirically-validated treatments, psychosocial or otherwise, that target anhedonia transdiagnostically. Given the high rates of clinically impairing anhedonia across a range of psychiatric disorders, as well as the relative ease with which BATA can be disseminated, this novel intervention has the potential to rapidly and meaningfully impact patient care in clinics that specialize in a range of disorders and conditions, including mood disorder clinics, anxiety disorder clinic, and general outpatient psychiatry services. The application proposed here cuts across multiple NIMH priorities and initiatives, including an experimental therapeutics approach to treatment development (NOT-MH-14-007: Policy for Submission of Applications Containing Clinical Trials), the use of standardized phenotype measures (NOT- MH-15-009: Data Harmonization for NIMH Human Subjects Research via the PhenX Toolkit), rigor and transparency in research (NOT-OD-16-011: Rigor and Transparency in NIH & AHRQ Research Grant Applications), and data sharing with the scientific community (NOT-MH-14-015: Data Sharing Expectations for NIMH-funded Clinical Trials and NOT-MH-15-012: Data Sharing Expectations for Clinical Research Funded by NIMH).',\n",

       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Placebo response is an important and poorly understood phenomenon of treatment response. A large and variable placebo response has been evident in decade?s long placebo-controlled double blind clinical trials that tested various treatments for alcohol use disorders (AUD). Large placebo effects complicate detection of quantifiable treatment effects for investigational medications, especially for the modestly effective psychiatric drugs. Placebo response arise from a complex interaction of patient, clinical trial staff, and treatment environment factors. Because the placebo response is intricate, complex and variable among individuals, it is challenging to identify these individuals prior to enrollment in a clinical trial. The proposed project seeks to explore the utility of genomics to identify placebo responders in phase ?? AUD treatment trials. To date, to the best of our knowledge, comprehensive genomic studies have not been conducted to assess genetic variation in relation to outcomes of AUD treatment or placebo response. Genomic analyses require large sample sizes that are not easy to gather in small to medium scale clinical trials conducted with treatment seeking individuals with an AUD or other drug use disorder. To address this issue, we will leverage the resources from six completed and two ongoing NIAAA-funded phase ?? AUD treatment trials. We will first examine changes in patterns of drinking among the enrolled treatment-seeking individuals with AUD, during treatment with a placebo (Aim ?). We will then explore how these changes in drinking affect expression of genes, perusing the entire genome of each individual (Aim ??). The genes whose expression levels are found to be changed according to a person?s drinking behavior or how frequent the person was able to abstain from alcohol, will be fine- combed to identify DNA sequence (genetic) variations that rendered them susceptible to varying amounts of alcohol (Aim ???). Next, we will explore whether these genetic variations and the expression patterns of their genes, can predict placebo response (as measured by abstinence rates) in populations with AUD together with other psychiatric conditions (cocaine addiction and PTSD; Exploratory Aim ?). Finally, we will explore whether the identified genetic variants and genes are expressed in the same manner in those who have received an active medication (ondansetron/topiramate/naltrexone) for the treatment of their AUD (Exploratory Aim ??), which may help us understand the placebo component embedded within response to an active medication, at a molecular level. In summary, our proposed project is conceptually and methodologically innovative in exploring genetic variations by examining gene expression differences associated with amounts of drinking during placebo treatment. As the first study to characterize genomics of placebo response in phase ?? AUD trials, findings will provide a wealth of information for future translational research and propagate personalized medicine. Harnessing the placebo response and knowing how to optimize it will allow us to: a) improve overall outcomes; b) determine who is in need of additional treatment, and c) characterize the therapeutic index (efficacy/side effects) for particular subgroups with AUD.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY This K08 Career Development Award details a four-year training program to advance Dr. Samelson-Jones? career goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist focused on leveraging molecular insights of biological processes into new therapeutics for children with congenital blood disorders. During the award period, Dr. Samelson-Jones will continue developing his expertise in coagulation biochemistry, acquire new scientific skills, deepen his knowledge of molecular and cellular immunology, and advance his translational capabilities. Under the guidance of his mentor, Dr. Mortimer Ponz, and co-mentor, Dr. Valder Arruda, these training objectives will be met by a combination of didactic course work, participation in seminar series, research experience, and mentoring by his advisory committee. His advisory committee is composed of world- renowned scientists with extensive mentoring experience and diverse and complementary scientific expertise including Drs. Sriram Krishnaswamy, Rodney Camire, and Michael Milone. The scientific proposal is aimed at addressing the current limitations of therapies for hemophilia B (HB). HB is due to an inheritable deficiency in coagulation Factor IX (FIX) activity. The current standard-of-care in the developed world for HB is to replace the missing FIX with intravenous infusions, but there are also several ongoing early phase gene therapy trials. Recently, it was demonstrated that the incorporation of the hyperactive FIX variant, R338L into a gene therapeutic partially mitigates previously identified efficacy limitations without additional safety concerns. This result emphasizes the potential of hyperactive FIX variants as gene, protein, or cell therapeutics for HB. Dr. Samelson-Jones? proposal focuses on identifying and carefully characterizing new FIX variants with increased activity. He has developed a rational strategy to identify new hyperactive FIX variants by specifically testing substitutions at positions that are 1) evolutionarily conserved; 2) absent from the HB database; and 3) structurally important for protease function. This approach has already identified several new hyperactive FIX variants. The activity of one new variant, FIX-LK, exceeds the activity of FIX-R338L by over 2 fold. In Aim 1, additional FIX variants will be identified and biochemically characterized with recombinant FIX protein. The in vivo efficacy of the best performing new variant will be comprehensively evaluated as protein and gene therapeutics in a HB mouse model in Aim 2. In Aim 3, the safety of the most promising new variants is assessed. The immunogenicity and thrombogenicity of new FIX variants is compared to wild-type FIX after provocative challenges in novel HB mouse models.',\n",
       " 'A key goal of HIV-1 vaccine development is to induce long-lasting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that can inhibit HIV-1 infection. Messenger (m) RNA has emerged as a promising new vaccine modality that can elicit potent immune responses, while avoiding the safety risks and anti-vector immunity associated with some live virus vaccines. Important targets for bnAb induction are N301, N332 glycans at the base of the gp120 V3 loop. Our overall goals in this grant are 1) To design an mRNA that encodes a V3-glycan mimetope that, when expressed, will bind a V3 glycan UCA; 2) To select and produce mRNA formulations non-GMP that encode HIV-1 Envs for immunization in humanized mice and RMs; and 3) To produce the sequential V3-glycan mRNA vaccine under CGMP conditions, perform toxicity studies, and prepare an IND for testing in a Phase I trial in man. Overall Specific Aim 1. Develop mRNA delivery constructs for sequential Env trimers for V3-glycan bnAb B cell lineage vaccinations. Hypotheses: Messenger RNA vaccination of humanized mice, Rhesus macaques and humans will induce long-lasting anti-V3 glycan bnAb epitope antibodies, and mRNA vaccination will promote sequential somatic hypermutations and affinity maturation in V3-glycan targeted B cell lineages. Overall Specific Aim 2. Produce CGMP mRNA immunogens. Hypotheses: Messenger RNAs can be produced and encapsulated in potent nanoparticle formulations under CGMP for use in human Phase I trials, and will be safe and immunogenic. Moreover, the mRNA immunogens selected for CGMP production will produce stable Env trimers upon transfection of cell lines in vitro and after immunization in vivo in humanized mice. Expectations and Impact on the Field. Messenger RNAs are the current most promising vaccine strategy for inducing high-titered and long-lasting antibody responses. A successful first in man Phase I clinical trial with clinical trials materials produced in this IPCAVD will change the field by showing the plausibility of initiation of V3-glycan bnAb B cell lineages.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Residual oral inflammation along with chronic systemic immune activation is an important feature in many (HIV)/Combined Antiretroviral therapy (cART) patients, and has been linked to a wide range of oral pathologies including periodontitis, erythematous candidal lesions, viral infections and oral cancer. Although cART can suppress plasma viral loads to undetectable levels, increased mortality is closely associated with mucosal immune dysbiosis and persistent viral reservoirs in lymphoid tissues. To date, however, the majority of research on immune activation has been derived from analysis of circulating quiescent T cells. How microbial products from altered oral microbiome and opportunistic pathogens contribute to immune cell alterations and oral mucosal dysbiosis is unknown. A better comprehension of this phenomenon, and various interactions between immune cells, commensal and pathogenic microbes is needed to shed light on HIV-mediated immune oral immune dysfunction. Our proposal will investigate these interactions with a specific focus on Th17 cells and Tregs, the critical subsets of CD4+ T lymphocytes that play crucial roles in maintaining the mucosal barrier integrity and preventing inflammation respectively. We hypothesize that loss of oral Th17 cells and increase in proportions of dysfunctional Tregs contribute to residual oral inflammation in HIV+ patients. We will determine the functions of interventional IL-21 in restoring Th17 cells during HIV infection. We will also define the role of TLR signaling and IL-6 in inducing Treg plasticity, generating dysfunctional Tregs and contributing to oral immune pathogenesis of HIV+ individuals. These studies will contribute to new ways of thinking about oral inflammation in HIV+ individuals, and aid in generating novel therapeutic strategies to manage HIV mediated chronic oral dysbiosis.  This multidisciplinary project supported by a robust procurement network for human tonsillar and oral tissues from HIV+ individuals will enable an unprecedented insight into HIV dependent oral mucosal inflammatory mechanisms, and is compatible with Trans-NIH FY-2016 funding priorities for HIV research that states ?Study the effect of the CD4+ T-cell pool heterogeneity in terms of differentiation .. lineage (Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, Tfh), anatomic location (blood versus lymphoid tissues versus mucosal tissues)?, as area of research priority. Most importantly, by defining the immune plasticity mechanisms in Th17 cells and Tregs during HIV+/SIV infection, the project fits well with the program objectives for RFA-DE-17-006.  ',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alcohol consumption during pregnancy persists as a featured topic in public health, yet the impact of early pregnancy exposure on miscarriage risk remains uncertain. Despite recommendations for women who are planning a pregnancy or who might become pregnant to abstain from alcohol, over 50% of women report alcohol exposure at some point in the first trimester regardless of pregnancy intention. The objective of the proposed work is to examine the relationship between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and miscarriage risk through three approaches with the central hypothesis that the relationship between alcohol consumption and risk of miscarriage is dependent on timing of exposure. For my first aim, I will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the present understanding of this risk-relationship and to critically evaluate the design and analytical features of prior studies. After taking account of the current literature's shortcomings, such as the common practice of modeling alcohol consumption as a static exposure during pregnancy, I will delineate the relationship between alcohol use and miscarriage risk in the Right from the Start (RFTS) cohort for my second aim. RFTS is a community-based pregnancy cohort that is nationally recognized for its success in recruiting women in early pregnancy and collecting detailed information on first trimester exposures, including pattern of alcohol consumption in early pregnancy. Modeling alcohol use as a time-varying exposure is a more rigorous and appropriate technique than methods used in prior studies and estimating the risk- relationship with proportional hazard models will further improve upon past methods by accounting for timing of cohort entry and exit. For my third aim, I will investigate whether alcohol metabolism modifies the relationship between exposure and miscarriage risk by determining haplotypes of RFTS participants for the ADH1C gene, which is related to rate of alcohol clearance. I will then evaluate the interaction between alcohol exposure and haplotype in relation to miscarriage risk. Together, this work will provide more precise information about how pattern of alcohol exposure in early pregnancy relates to miscarriage and has the potential to inform more specific approaches for mitigating risk.\",\n",

Although two mechanistically novel antibiotic classes exist to treat such infections (Daptomycin; DAP and Linezolid; LZD), their use in the clinic for nearly two decades has not reversed this trend. Moreover, DAP and LZD possess significant limitations; the former is solely IV-administered in a clinical setting, which significantly increases health care costs, and the latter, although delivered by IV and PO, can cause serious adverse effects, including myelosuppression following extended use, and resistance has emerged. The introduction of tedizolid is not likely to thwart LZD resistance since it shares the LZD target. Conversely, ?-lactam antibiotics have historically served as the most impactful class of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections but their efficacy has been eroded by the emergence of MRSA/E. Reestablishing ?- lactams as a standard of care therapy for Gram-positive bacterial infections including MRSA/E would provide clinicians a new therapeutic option addressing these issues and offer an antibiotic stewardship strategy to mitigate resistance to DAP and LZD. In recently published work, we have demonstrated that the Wall Teichoic Acid (WTA) biosynthetic pathway is rich in ? -lactam potentiation targets. Building upon a solid foundation of preliminary data, our Aims are: Aim 1 (Phase 1; Ph1). Focused discovery effort to identify compounds with potency and pharmacokinetics (PK) superior to tarocin A2, for oral combination with dicloxacillin (DCX) or IV combination with imipenem (IPM). Aim 2 (Phase 2; Ph2). Expansion of SAR and detailed characterization of hit compounds. Aim 3 (Ph2). Advancement of at least two compounds from Aim 2 through in vivo efficacy testing to identify lead candidates.',\n",
       " 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations that affect several organs. SLE affects millions of individuals, with women and minorities disproportionately burdened, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite considerable progress made towards understanding the disease and the identification of the central roles plasma cells (PCs) and autoreactive antibody secreting cells (ASCs) play in SLE pathogenesis, most therapeutic approaches remain broadly immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, or palliative, which highlights the urgent need for novel therapies. Due to the essential role of auto-antibodies in the amplification of auto-immunity, a goal in lupus therapy is the elimination of auto-reactive ASCs. Karyopharm Therapeutics pioneered the development of Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export (SINE), and is investigating their utility in auto-immune diseases in collaboration with the Anolik laboratory at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Together we have shown that inhibiting nuclear export with KPT-350, a SINE, strongly and selectively ablates auto-reactive PCs by targeting pathways that are critical for their generation, survival, and recruitment into inflamed kidneys. Specifically, we have shown that KPT-350 selectively inhibits the production of auto-reactive ASCs and has a compelling effect on B-cell germinal center formation/stability, prevents expansion of memory T follicular helper cells, and markedly reduces mRNA expression of molecules critical for survival and recruitment of auto-reactive ASCs. In the proposed project, we will further define the efficacy of SINE treatment and identify viable combination and maintenance therapies to accelerate the translation of these novel compounds into SLE clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will define the optimal dosage conditions to restrain murine lupus progression after withdrawal of SINE therapy by (i) determining the duration of the SINE effect and defining the need for maintenance therapy, and (ii) defining the duration of the SINE effect on NF?B inhibition. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of combination modality therapy on murine autoreactive PCs by (i) evaluating the efficacy and duration of SINE and proteasome inhibitors on autoimmune disease relapse, (ii) determining the effects of single vs combination therapy on PCs in SLE, and (iii) defining the impact of factors involved in the maintenance of autoreactive PCs. Finally, Aim 3 will expand our studies to human SLE by (i) defining the role of NF?B survival signals in SLE patient PCs, (ii) examining the effect SINE treatment has on SLE PC survival, (iii) defining the signals required for SLE bone marrow (BM) PC survival, (iv) identifying the source of PC survival factors in the BM, and (v) demonstrating that SINE therapy inhibits B-cell differentiation. Our goal is to delineate an efficacious combination dosing strategy, using a novel approach that targets key synergistic pathways in SLE disease pathogenesis, with the long term goal of delivering an improved therapy for SLE. Successful completion of these studies will allow us to pursue commercialization objectives and move SINE compounds into extensive preclinical safety testing.',\n",
       " 'Abstract  Hematopoiesis relies on the proper function of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), in their capacity for both self-renewal and differentiation. Genetic lesions in these cell populations can give rise to myeloid malignancies including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Myeloproliferative neoplasms, which result in the expansion of mature myeloid compartments, commonly harbor aberrations or mutations involving the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Mutations in JAK2, CALR, and MPL are found in the majority of MPN cases, however cooperating co-driver mutations and disease modifiers are relatively poorly understood. Current treatment options for Philadelphia-chromosome-negative (Ph-) MPNs provide symptomatic relief and do not significantly alter overall survival. Moreover, leukemic transformation to AML is a common occurrence in Ph- MPN patients, and is thought to be due to acquisition of additional mutations which ultimately lead to a dramatic reduction in patient survival. The process of leukemic transformation of MPN to AML still remains unclear, and gaining insight into the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon may provide openings for new interventions for preventing disease progression.  We have discovered that loss of the Nol3 gene in mice leads to an MPN-like disease closely resembling primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Paradoxical to its canonical functions in repressing apoptosis, deletion of Nol3 results in an increased expansion and cycling of HSPCs in the bone marrow and spleen, suggesting a novel role for Nol3 within the hematopoietic system. Our analyses show that Nol3 is frequently downregulated or deleted in patients with PMF and other myeloid malignancies, and our data provides a link between Nol3 expression and JAK/STAT activation in MPN and AML cells, implicating Nol3 in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.  Our proposal seeks to (1) characterize the molecular role of Nol3 in hematopoiesis by defining molecular functions and subcellular localization, as well as identifying functional binding partners, (2) relate Nol3 loss to human disease by dissecting the role of Nol3 within the JAK/STAT pathway and identifying critical functional domains, and (3) gain insight into cooperativity between Nol3 loss and mutational drivers in MPN and transformation to AML. Our study will not only provide a novel and robust model for studying myeloid malignancies, but will also help define for the first time a role for Nol3 as a myeloid tumor suppressor and key component of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. More importantly, our studies will also link Nol3 to human myeloid malignancy, which will provide a deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of disease.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Fungi are ubiquitous colonizers of skin and mucosal surfaces. While many individuals exhibit minor fungal outgrowth, millions of others experience systemic infections with life-threatening consequences. Polymorphisms in numerous genes have been associated with the ability of an individual to generate an inflammatory response to fungal pathogens. In many of these genes, rare high-penetrance alleles have been observed that strongly disrupt gene function, resulting in primary immunodeficiencies and an increase in infectious disease susceptibility. Additionally, common genetic variants have been reported in these genes that increase the risk of disease by modifying the activity or expression of the gene product to a small but significant degree. These genes offer a unique opportunity to understand how immune responses to pathogens are tuned to achieve an appropriate level of immune response. This hypothesis is well illustrated by the various phenotypes associated with different genetic variants of CARD9. CARD9 is a signaling protein that functions downstream of many C- type lectin receptors (CLRs), which recognize carbohydrate moieties on fungi and other pathogens. Understanding how these human disease-related CARD9 mutations affect CARD9 functions will advance our understanding of fungal immunity. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we examine the role of Card9 ubiquitination on fungal detection by dendritic cells. In Aim 2, we will identify the molecular mechanisms controlling Card9 phosphorylation and their consequences for fungal detection. In Aim 3, we compare how Card9 genetic variants affect Candida infection and the development of colitis. Together, these aims will decipher the mechanistic basis of CARD9 regulation and characterize CARD9 genetic variants to identify novel molecular mechanisms with important roles in fungal defense and inflammation.',\n",
       " \"ABSTRACT  Zika virus (ZIKV) is linked to microcephaly and other birth defects, and thus the emerging epidemic of ZIKV in the Americas poses significant health threats. Despite the considerable impact of ZIKV infection on world-wide health, no antiviral therapies are available, and existing flavivirus vaccines are of limited utility. Our long-term goal is to obtain detailed structural and biochemical information regarding ZIKV replication and to use this information for the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. In particular, the ZIKV RNA genome contains a stem loop A (SLA) at the 5'-end that acts as a promoter element for the viral polymerase NS5 to initiate RNA synthesis. Thus, the structural information on ZIKV SLA and its interaction with ZIKV NS5 will be essential to understand the mechanism of NS5-mediated initiation of RNA replication. Knowledge of the mechanism by which the polymerase recognizes the SLA promoter will additionally identify potential therapeutic targets, and suggest strategies for intervention against ZIKV replication. Our goals of the project are to characterize the interaction site between ZIKV NS5 and SLA using binding assays (Aim 1) and determine the structure of ZIKV SLA by a combination of our pRNA fusion technique and cryo-electron microscopy (Aim 2). Because SLA and NS5 interaction is essential for viral replication, RNA decoys that bind NS5 specifically may inhibit ZIKV replication. We will thus identify structural features in SLA that are conserved among flaviviruses, and design SLA decoys as potential ZIKV inhibitors.\",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT DNA damage can occur from extrinsic sources e.g., irradiation or intrinsic sources, e.g., unresolved transcriptional R-loops (DNA-RNA hybrids plus displaced single-stranded DNA). The cell employs multiple mechanisms not only to repair the damage but to also promote cell survival while repair is underway. One recently described mechanism promoting cell survival following DNA damage involves fragmentation and dispersal of Golgi-complex throughout the cytosol, aims known as Golgi-dispersal response (GDR) (Farber-Katz et al., 2014). Here, impaired GDR resulted in cell death. Because lymphocytes from patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), an X-linked primary immunodeficiency disorder, undergo spontaneous, accelerated apoptosis (Rawlings et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2017), we hypothesized that impaired GDR underlies progressive lymphopenia in WAS, and that a defect in GDR contributes, at least in part, to the development of immunodeficiency. The concept that WASp has an essential cytoplasmic role in the DNA damage response and repair (DDR) signaling is innovative, because WASp role in cytoplasm has traditionally been restricted to remodeling F-actin cortical cytoskeleton in the context of TCR activation. In strong support of this hypothesis, are our preliminary findings demonstrating a profoundly inhibited GDR following ?-irradiation-induced DNA strand breaks in WASp-deficient T cells. That the GDR event could be of immediate physiological relevance to the lymphocyte biology is further supported by our findings that WASp-deficiency triggers ectopic accumulation of unresolved R loops, the latter, we show generates DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) during Th1 gene activation. We, therefore, propose that the transcription-linked DNA damage in WAS lymphocytes will not accompany cell protective GDR, and the degree of GDR dysfunction will correlate with disease severity grades in WAS. Aim 1 focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which loss of WASp disrupts the GDR signaling pathway, focusing on the formation and function of DNA-PK- GOLPH3-F-actin-MYO18A complex during DNA damage, both ?-irradiation-mediated and transcriptional R-loop-mediated. In Aim 2, we will ask how disease-causing, WAS gene mutations differ in disrupting GDR signaling in Th1, Th2, and B cells, and investigate how WAS mutations that cause increased F-actin or decreased F-actin differentially influence GDR competency. Therefore, if successful, we would identify a novel cytoplasmic role of WASp in the DDR pathway, and uncover GDR defect as etiologic of a primary immunodeficiency disorder.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and has historically been reported to cause mild symptomatic diseases and neurological syndromes during human infections. More recently, the explosion of microcephaly among infants born to ZIKV-infected women has made ZIKV a global public health concern. Apart from reports of sexual and congenital transmission, ZIKV is primarily transmitted by certain infected species of Aedes mosquitoes. In the absence of a vaccine or an approved antiviral drug, vector control strategies remain the only mechanism for control of Zika infections. While ZIKV causes acute human diseases, infections of vector mosquitoes are basically non-pathogenic, allowing persistent infections and conferring lifelong ability to transmit the virus. However, the mechanisms of establishment and maintenance of persistent infections in mosquitoes are unclear. In addition, vertical transmission of flaviviruses, which plays an unknown role in maintaining the virus in nature during adverse conditions, is poorly understood. The objective of this application is to elucidate the mechanisms of persistent infections in mosquitoes, with the ultimate goal of developing new strategies for transmission interventions. Research over the past several years on various mosquito-borne viruses has indicated that the different outcomes of arboviral infections in humans and mosquitoes are due to differences in the innate-immune responses between the two hosts. ZIKV, like most arboviruses, contains RNA as its genetic material, and several studies have suggested that the RNA- interference (RNAi) defense pathway is a major antiviral defense mechanism in mosquitoes. Nevertheless, it is unclear how ZIKV evades the robust RNAi response to establish persistent infections. Recent published studies have indicated that DNA forms of several arboviral RNA genomes are generated following infection in mosquito cell cultures and in mosquitoes, and small RNAs (sRNAs) deriving from viral DNAs (vDNAs) reinforce the RNAi response against viral infections. The proposed work tests a hypothesis that upon infection, vDNA in somatic cells aids to establish and maintain persistent infections, whereas vDNA in germline cells restricts virus replication. The Specific Aims are to determine I) the role of vDNA in ZIKV replication using mosquito cell cultures, and II) the role of vDNA in ZIKV replication in germline cells. Mosquito cell lines Aag and U4.4 from Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, respectively, will be used for Aim I and colonized populations of both species will be used for Aim II. The results of these studies are expected to shed light on mosquito-virus interactions and lead to the development of new vector-control strategies. For example, it may be possible to develop strategies to stop the transition from acute to persistent infections in mosquitoes and/or to eliminate the infected mosquitoes from the population.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY Acinetobacter baumannii is an important nosocomial pathogen that causes a range of diseases, including respiratory and urinary tract infections, meningitis, endocarditis, wound infections, and bacteremia. In fact, A. baumannii is now responsible for up to 20% of all intensive care unit infections in some regions of the world with pneumonia being the most common presentation. The clinical significance of A. baumannii has been propelled by this organism's rapid acquisition of resistance to virtually all antibiotics. The identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention is critical to our ability to protect the public health from this emerging infectious threat. One promising potential area of therapeutic development involves targeting bacterial access to nutrient metal or metal handling. This strategy is based on the fact that all bacterial pathogens require nutrient metal in order to colonize their hosts, and alterations in dietary metal levels profoundly affect susceptibility to infection. The host protein calprotectin (CP) is one of the most important contributors to immune-mediated metal restriction and CP protects against infection through the chelation of nutrient zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn). In this application, we describe our use of CP as a probe to uncover a genetic locus within A. baumannii that is involved in survival during conditions of CP-dependent Zn starvation. This locus encodes a member of the conserved COG0523 family of GTPases that we have named Zur-induced GTPase A (ZigA), and a D-alanine D-alanine carboxypeptidase that we have named Zn-regulated lipoprotein A (ZrlA). We have discovered that ZigA is a metallochaperone that provides Zn to client proteins and is required for the liberation of a biovavailable Zn pool during conditions of Zn starvation. This finding establishes ZigA as the first example of a Zn metallochaperone in nature. In addition, our model predicts that ZrlA is required to maintain cell wall architecture during Zn stress. Based on these fundamental discoveries, we hypothesize that upon Zn starvation, A. baumannii mobilizes Zn to critical Zn-requiring client proteins, while also activating the expression of a carboxypeptidase involved in peptidoglycan remodeling that substitutes for the loss of activity of a Zn-requiring paralog. To test this central hypothesis, we propose a series of experiments aimed at understanding the mechanism and pathophysiological consequence of the A. baumannii response to dietary and host-imposed Zn deprivation during the pathogenesis of pneumonia. In these studies, we will (i) define the target of the ZigA Zn-metallochaperone during conditions of CP- imposed Zn restriction, (ii) elucidate the contribution of ZrlA to peptidoglycan remodeling during conditions of Zn deprivation, and (iii) determine the importance of Zn distribution during the pathogenesis of A. baumannii pneumonia. These results will provide fundamental insight into how A. baumannii responds to nutrient deprivation in the vertebrate host, and lay the foundation for the creation of peptide therapeutics based on a CP scaffold that inhibit microbial growth through nutrient metal chelation.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract The HIV epidemic continues to present a significant global burden. Although they represent half of the global epidemic, development of effective prevention strategies for women has been slow. Tenofovir-based pre-exposure prophylaxis has demonstrated success in reducing HIV infections however two failed clinical trials have raised concern about effectiveness in women. Host factors such as inflammation, hormones, and the vaginal microbiome may modulate not only HIV risk, but drug efficacy as well. In this career development award, advanced training will be obtained in the techniques and approaches required to develop an independent scientist proficient in performing the translational studies required to better elucidate the complex mucosal environment of the female genital tract. This research proposal will lay the ground work studies characterizing the effect of hormones, inflammation, and the vaginal microbiome on drug exposure and efficacy in cervical tissues. Active metabolites of tenofovir and other nucleotide analogues will be measured in cervical biopsies from HIV positive women from U.S. and Ugandan cohorts receiving hormonal contraception. Quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines and 16S DNA sequencing will be performed in swabs to assess inflammation and the vaginal microbiome of these women. Ex vivo tissue models will be used to determine associations between inflammation, nucleotide analogue activation, and viral inhibition. Completion of these research aims, with the guidance of an interdisciplinary mentoring team, will be supplemented by advanced coursework and workshops in statistics, immunology, microbiomics, and research ethics. This research and training plan are designed to result in the preliminary data and developed expertise necessary to prepare for an R01 submission elucidating the complex interplay between hormones, microbiome, inflammation, drug disposition, target cell expression, and drug potency in the female genital tract.',\n",
       " 'Abstract  We have long taken for granted to rely on the current HIV recombinant classification system for various aspects of HIV recombination study. However, the central line of this system is flawed in that the viral evolution - an intrinsic feature to HIV - has not been taken into account in the establishment of recombinant families. As a result, each recombinant family defined by the current naming system literally depicts a cross-sectional view of the viral evolution. And in practice, a lack of a dynamic and evolutionary view of virus trajectory would render the design of vaccine and antiviral suboptimal. To address such a flaw in the HIV recombinant classification system, here we propose a novel methodology and research pipeline that will be performed through the following specific aims: In Aim 1, we will determine an actual, up-to-date sequence list of worldwide HIV recombinant strains, which will form the basis for determining HIV recombinant families; and in Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology to integrate viral evolution in clustering recombinant families. Importantly, our proposed methodology does not require prior knowledge of family reference strains, thus avoiding possible bias caused by an inappropriate selection of family references. Given the biological importance of HIV recombination and a growing prevalence of HIV recombinants in both global and regional epidemics, our proposed study is important in that we address a flaw in the recombinant classification system, which sets the basis for genomic-based health care and prevention targeting epidemically important recombinant strains. Our proposed study would be the first of its kind to address such a flaw in the recombinant classification system. We will benefit from our decade- long research in HIV molecular epidemiology and extensive experience with algorithm and analysis program development to perform this proposed study. By the end of this study, we expect to obtain a dynamic vision of individual HIV recombinant families, which would help improve the design of vaccine and antivirals targeting recombinant epidemics. Finally, the novel strategy developed in this study can be easily applied to other viruses that have encountered similar problems in recombinant clustering.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The loss of a spouse is a highly stressful event that puts people at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 20% to 53% of excess deaths during spousal bereavement. Stress, depression, and anxiety enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Indeed, psychological stress and depression promote transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) activation, a prime pathway for upregulating proinflammatory cytokine production. Importantly, inflammation is central to all stages of cardiovascular disease from initial lesion to end-stage thrombotic complications. Inflammation may be a key mechanism underlying CVD among the bereaved. Attachment theory is a useful framework for understanding individual differences in people's ability to adjust to the loss of a loved one. There are two patterns of attachment insecurity: attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. People with high attachment anxiety use hyperactivating emotional coping strategies. People with high attachment avoidance are uncomfortable depending on others for support and use deactivating coping strategies that inhibit or suppress distressing experiences. Individual differences in attachment style may be prognostic for who is most at risk for enhanced inflammation and ultimately CVD after the loss of a spouse. Cardiac vagal tone (as reflected by respiratory sinus arrhythmia or RSA) is associated with self-regulation. Under stressful conditions individuals with low RSA display poorer self-regulatory control compared to those with high RSA. Low vagal tone is also a risk factor for CVD, partly due to elevations in inflammation. Recent work by this new/early stage investigator suggests that RSA and attachment style may jointly influence adjustment to a loss. This project builds upon these preliminary findings to examine mechanistic connections among attachment insecurity, depression, RSA, and inflammation cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with data on these key dimensions collected 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the spouse's death. Participants will be spouses of patients who recently passed away to stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and matched controls. If inflammation is an important mechanism underlying bereavement, both psychosocial and pharmaceutical interventions aimed at reducing inflammation would be an important step toward the development of treatments for bereaved individuals. These interventions may be especially important for people with certain psychological characteristics.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many HIV cure studies are planned or expected. These studies often involve high or unknown risks, raising serious ethical challenges concerning (I) risk/benefit ratios, (II) informed consent, and (III) trust in investigators. Little empirical r philosophical research into these challenges is available. The proposed study will use modeling to assess objective risks from various HIV cure interventions, use surveys to assess patients' and investigators' risk ethical approval and willingness to partake in those studies, and use philosophical analysis to make related recommendations on the ethical conduct of HIV cure studies. Innovation: The proposed study is innovative in several ways: (a) It will apply CEPAC modeling, which has been validated in other contexts, to investigate the new area of HIV cure interventions; (b) It will use our ready access to the large ACTG network, which has successfully supported other surveys, for a large survey of patients and clinicians on something for which no survey currently exists-ethics and willingness to participate in risky HIV cure studies; (c) It is the first large study to thoroughly examine these philosophical challenges in HIV cure studies; (d) It will translate ethics insights from early phase cancer studies, other first-in-human studies and elsewhere into practical recommendations for ethical HIV cure research, to guide investigators, funders, and IRBs, honed with key stakeholders. Approach: We will first compile and catalogue conceivable responses to the ethical challenge of HIV cure studies. Some responses will be immediately screened out for obvious logical, practical, or ethical flaws (Filte A). Among remaining responses, we shall assess the risks of cure interventions comprising them (Aim 1). We shall also conduct surveys to check how much HIV patients and clinicians in 34 US-based ACTG sites are willing to partake in studies that involve similar risk levels, and how morally acceptable they would find such studies (Aim 2). Combined, Aims 1 and 2 will rule out some responses to the challenge as infeasible (Filter B). Then, we shall assess the ethics of remaining responses to the challenge (Filter C) and make recommendations on how to conduct HIV cure studies ethically (Aim 3). Our draft recommendations will be presented to HIV cure decision makers, IRB members, and other key stakeholders to obtain feedback and hone the recommendations. (Filter D). We propose the following aims:  1. Assess through modeling the risk from HIV cure study participation for various patient populations.  2. Empirically assess HIV investigators' and HIV patients' ethical evaluation and willingness to partake in HIV cure studies involving given risk levels.  3. Use these results, along with philosophical analysis, published ethics literature, feedback from our Board of Advisors, and feedback from key stakeholders, to form model ethical recommendations for  HIV cure research.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY  The lung is a richly innervated organ. Strong evidence, including recent findings from us, demonstrates that neuronal control plays central roles in basic lung response to the environment, including immune activity, as well as airway and vascular smooth muscle tone which impacts air conductance and pulmonary blood pressure, respectively. However, the full extent of how the nervous system affects lung function remains unclear, and little is known of the anatomical and molecular features of the neurons that innervate the lung. Here, we propose to use cutting-edge viral-based circuit tracing, single cell transcriptomic and haploid ES cell- based genome editing technologies to: 1) label lung-innervating neurons; 2) determine their localization and projection pattern; 3) generate knockin mouse lines that will lay the foundation for neuromodulation of lung function. Findings generated in mice will be tested in human biopsy samples to delineate conserved versus species-specific mechanisms. With the development of wireless, implantable devices, neuromodulatory therapy is on the horizon. Findings from this study will lay the necessary foundation for precise manipulation of organ function through the nervous system, and thus closely comply with the mission of the SPARC program.',\n",
       " 'President Barack Obama was delivering on a promise made in his State of the Union Address when he  officially launched the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), igniting intensive work by Dr. Francis Collins and the PMI Working Group this year. The promise is bold: nothing less than truly revolutionizing the way we develop therapies and treatments for patients across America. With the PMI, we can credibly claim that we will improve health outcomes for all.  Achieving this vision will require the efforts of numerous healthcare stakeholders. Because the PMI has the promise to solve our most intractable health problems by harnessing the power of data, success requires recruiting individuals willing to share their personal information. These volunteers ? the 1 million Americans who will comprise the PMI Cohort Program (PMI-CP) ? are the pillars upon which the PMI will stand. The volunteers will need to understand the goals of the PMI, the logistics of what volunteering means and the specifics of why sharing their personal health data and biospecimens will benefit the health of future generations. With the right communications strategy, cohort volunteers will not only understand their individual importance to this cause, they will also be actively enthusiastic, and assist in the recruitment of additional volunteers from their communities.  This is a proposal to help accomplish this feat through a multi- faceted campaign with a suite of outreach strategies designed to find, educate, and activate a cohort that is representative of the diversity of our country. It will require communications strategies that reach many thousands at a time, as well as multiple targeted, personalized micro-strategies. Messaging is at the core of achieving buy-in and making participation a matter of personal, community, and civic pride. As bold and large as the PMI is, recruiting the cohort comes down to the individual.  Garnering this level of buy-in will require a team with expertise in not only communications and patient advocacy, but also with a record of achieving the level of trust needed to connect with individuals in a meaningful way and the ability to motivate them to take action. The team must have the ability to speak across cultures, ethnicities, and socio-economic statuses. We have assembled that team. And we would be honored to make the PMI vision a reality.',\n",
       " 'Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest public health threats worldwide. The development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens is largely driven by inappropriate antimicrobial use. Current reports state that over 50% of antimicrobial use in hospitals and up to 70% in long-term care facilities is potentially inappropriate. Recognizing the urgency of this national crisis, President Obama issued an executive order in September 2014, mandating the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs (AMS) nationally, and specifically noting that ?all VA healthcare settings, including long-term care facilities? will be involved. Unfortunately, this process of developing AMS in VA Community Living Centers has lagged behind those in acute-care facilities and little is known about the degree of antibiotic resistance and the types of stewardship interventions that might work in these facilities. Antimicrobial stewardship promotes the appropriate use of antimicrobials in order to improve patient safety and to decrease adverse events related to inappropriate antimicrobial use. Improving antimicrobial use in acute-care facilities is a critical focus of The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), as evidenced by the recent VHA Directive 1031. This policy charges every Veterans Affairs (VA) acute care facility to develop and implement an antimicrobial stewardship program led by champion physicians and pharmacists. This VHA Directive does not currently require the implentation of antimicrobial stewardship activities within nursing homes. In 2013, the VHA provided care to over 100,000 veterans in nursing homes. This proposal brings together a cadre of VA experts in the fields of long term care quality improvement, infectious diseases, geriatrics, and antibiotic stewardship (MDs, PharmDs, PhD) to directly address this timely area of study. In direct response to an HSRD priority area for research involving long term care, the overall goals of this 4 year mixed methods merit proposal are to determine the scope of antimicrobial resistance among VA CLCs, to compare that information with antimicrobial utilization patterns in CLCs and proximal VAMCs, and to develop effective antimicrobial stewardship strategies tailored for the long term care environment. We hypothesize that resistance patterns and antibiotic use for CLCs will vary significantly and will be different from those observed in proximal acute care facilities. Furthermore, we hypothesize that comprehensive interdisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship programs will have the capacity to reduce selection for drug-resistant pathogens for the CLC, minimize transmission of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among patients, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes provided that they are tailored to the unique barriers that long term care entails. The specific aims of this study are: 1) Measure antimicrobial use and resistance in VA-CLCs nationally through the development of a longitudinal database of antimicrobial use and resistance. This database would allow us to quantify regional and temporal trends, and identify areas of high antimicrobial use and resistance nationally, 2) Develop and implement various well researched antimicrobial stewardship practices and programs at three CLCs, 3) Measure Antimicrobial Stewardship interventions on resistance, antimicrobial use and outcomes data from pilot CLCs.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the previous funding period, we made significant advances in the discovery and characterization of the lipid rafts of Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease. Cholesterol glycolipids form lipid rafts in both in vitro and host-derived spirochetes and that these domains have all the hallmarks of eukaryotic lipid rafts. We further demonstrated that the lipid rafts of B. burgdorferi shift their morphology at different temperatures and have a selective presence of lipoproteins, proteases and their substrates, sensing molecules, and homologs of eukaryotic lipid raft markers. Lipid rafts are dynamic structures with shifting protein cargo that define their biological functions. Fo this renewal application, we will expand our investigations into the dynamic features of the lipid rafts and into their function. The overall hypothesis is that the protein content as well the proten concentrations of lipid rafts change in response to the different conditions that the Borrelia moves through in its vector (tick) - host (mammal) stages, and that these changes influence the adaptation mechanisms required by the organisms to complete their life-cycle. To test this hypothesis, this renewal application will address the following Specific Aims: 1. To characterize the proteomes of the lipid rafts of Borrelia under different biological conditions, and 2. To probe the mechanisms of dynamic change and life-cycle adaptation by studying the contributions of unique elements of the proteome. A number of novel biophysical, imaging and biochemical approaches will provide the results to demonstrate that the Borrelia lipid rafts have important biological functions. Cholesterol as a component of bacterial membranes is being reported in an enlarging number of bacterial pathogens thereby increasing the significance of this proposal, as it is clear that cholesterol utilization is not an isolated feature of the Borreliae.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary Overall objective of the Resource for Integrated Glycotechnology is to develop novel, integrated technologies and multidisciplinary approaches to solve key problems in glycobiology. Protein-carbohydrate interactions play critical roles in numerous biological recognition events at the cell surface and extracellular matrix. The focus of our studies are proteoglycans (PGs), where extended, linear, charged glycan polymers are attached to cell surface or secreted proteins that contribute to cell-cell, cell-macromolecule,  and cell-matrix interactions and influence numerous biological functions. Studies on protein-PG interactions are a prototype for  more generalized studies on protein-carbohydrate interactions. Despite the critical importance of PGs in diverse biological processes, very little is known about the details of PG interactions with  binding partners or their mechanisms of biological function. As a result, PG-protein interactions are a major technical frontier for contemporary biology. We will address the challenges of PG structures, interactions, and biological functions by leveraging advances in analytical, synthetic,  structural, biochemical and biological tools. Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects will be applied to the study of several Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs) that will act as a test beds for the utility of the integrated approaches and provide feedback for new challenges that will spur further technology development. As the technologies mature they will be applied to a collection of Collaborative Projects and use in Analytical Services (C&S) that will  also extend the utility of the technologies to a broader scientific community. Multiple strategies for Dissemination will increase awareness and access to the technology developments and our Training courses (D&T) will provide  direct opportunities for researchers to learn the latest technology developments from Resource staff. The proposal aims to develop technologies (TR&Ds) to advance the goals of the DBPs through ligand identification and validation using PG fragment enrichment approaches, MS-based sequencing and composition analysis, and chemical glycan oligomer synthesis and array generation. Structures of PG-protein complexes will be determined using novel NMR methods and oxidative footprinting approaches and computational methods will predict and validate structure models. Biochemical targets will be generated in large quantities with isotopic labels and further modified to contain paramagnetic tags as needed to facilitate NMR studies. PG core proteins containing engineered glycan polymers will be generated using recombinant expression and cell systems harboring enhanced or mutant PG biosynthetic machinery. Mutant cell lines will also be used to characterize biological functions of PGs in appropriate biological contexts. The combined technology developments will advance our understanding of these critical glycan polymer structures and provide insights into their roles in human physiology and disease.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY In recent years, a massive increase in the rates of antibiotic resistant bacteria has been observed in clinical settings, causing significant concern from both the scientific community and government agencies. Among the pathogens causing these alarming infections is Acinetobacter baumannii, a microorganism that has developed resistance to almost all available antibiotics. Its extreme genome plasticity, largely facilitated by horizontal genetic transfer (HGT) processes, has contributed to its remarkable antibiotic-resistance phenotype. Transformation seems to be a particularly important HGT mechanism in this bacterium. However, the environmental signals triggering competence for natural transformation, the putative effectors involved in this process, and the molecular basis of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. Using the A. baumannii A118 clinical isolate as a model, the proposed project will examine the role of human host products as chemical inducers of DNA uptake. Considering our preliminary data, which show that different albumins cause a significant increase in the level of transformation frequency, this study will examine the role of Human Serum Albumin (HSA) and albumin-derived peptides in the development of bacterial competence and the uptake of foreign DNA (Aim 1). Moreover, we will determine the effects of HSA using a whole-genome transcriptional profiling approach in A118 (Aim 2). Through this last approach, we expect to identify genes and RNA regulators involved in natural transformation. This knowledge will provide critical insights into the molecular and cellular mechanism this pathogen uses to acquire resistance genes. Future studies can then use these findings to develop novel approaches to treat severe Acinetobacter human infections, particularly those caused by emerging multidrug-resistant isolates.',\n",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Summer Undergraduate Research Experience in Toxicology (SURE Tox) program at the University of Illinois will provide high quality research experiences for junior and senior undergraduate students during the summer academic break. The SURE Tox program will have its own identity, but it will also complement existing funded programs for undergraduate and medical students at the University of Illinois such as the Environmental Interdisciplinary Toxicology Program, the Summer Research Opportunities Program, the Toxicology Scholars Program, and the Summer Research Program for Veterinary Medical Students. The SURE Tox program will partner with several undergraduate universities with a high percentage of underrepresented minorities, the Native American House, and the Summer Research Opportunities Program to recruit high quality minority candidates into the program. The program will involve active participation by faculty members from several departments and colleges at the University of Illinois, all of whom have expertise in toxicology and experience training undergraduate students. The proposed training program will enroll 6 junior and senior undergraduate students who will spend 10 weeks over the summer in the program. The specific goals of the program are to: 1) match participants with faculty mentors who will direct the student to complete a hypothesis-driven project in the field of toxicology, 2) help each student learn laboratory techniques and research skills, 3) provide didactic training on animal use in research, the responsible conduct of research (e.g., research misconduct, mentor-trainee relationships, and data management), and use of the electronic library, 4) train students to prepare scientific posters and to present their work at scientific meetings, 5) provide networking opportunities for students to meet other students and faculty members in research, and 6) provide students with information on academic vs. industry careers in toxicology, and 7) provide each participant the opportunity to participate in GRE Institute workshops to prepare for the Graduate Record Exam. At the conclusion of the program, each student will present his or her work in a poster session held on campus. This training program will provide a unique opportunity for undergraduate students, particularly minority students, to obtain training and research experience in the field of toxicology at a research-intensive university with outstanding toxicology programs.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In animal models phthalates and stress can alter fetal androgens and disrupt androgen-sensitive endpoints. We will examine associations between exposure to phthalates and psychosocial stress at multiple time points in early childhood development and androgen-sensitive reproductive, anthropometric, and neurodevelopmental endpoints. In The Infant Development and the Environment Study (TIDES) we confirmed that first trimester phthalate exposure is significantly and inversely associated with boy's anogenital distance (AGD) and that prenatal stress can modify this association. These novel findings suggest hypotheses that can be addressed with further follow-up of the TIDES cohort during middle childhood. We propose to extend our methodology in several novel directions in order to achieve our overarching goal of identifying the effects of exposure to phthalates and stress on androgen-sensitive development. Children born to TIDES mothers will be invited to two study visits between 3 and 6 years of age. At the 1st visit we will measure height, weight, skin fold thickness, and head circumference, and collect a sample of the child's urine for phthalate measurement. We will assess the child's attention, hyperactivity, social responsiveness, and play behavior by parental report. At the 2nd visit we will repeat these assessments and measure the length of the 2nd and 4th digits and their ratio as well as measuring the child's verbal abilit and visuospatial reasoning by direct assessment. At each visit mothers will complete instruments designed to measure perceived stress, anxiety and depression, job stress and stressful life events. We will create a novel index that transforms the binary classification of se into a gender continuum score and examine its association with pre and postnatal exposure to phthalates and psychosocial stress. We hypothesize that physical measurements (AGD, digit ratio, head circumference) will be sensitive to prenatal exposure, while neurodevelopmental endpoints may be sensitive to both prenatal and postnatal exposure. We hypothesize that AGD will correlate with anthropometric outcomes as well as one or more neurodevelopmental endpoints such as play behavior as our preliminary data suggest. This study could have several implications for public health and environmental policy. Finding robust associations between developmental endpoints and phthalate exposure at current low levels would suggest the need for further reducing exposure. If newborn AGD predicts dimorphic development in multiple domains this would strengthen its importance as a marker of altered androgen-related development. If maternal stress modifies associations between phthalates and dimorphic development, as we have seen with AGD, this would lend support to efforts to reduce stress-related exposures during pregnancy. Any one of these findings from this large, robust, multi- center prospective study would support the hypothesis that a common androgen-dependent mechanism underlies these associations. Our findings could impact future research and policy because our study exposures are ubiquitous and many of our study endpoints, or their correlates, are early predictors of lifelong health.\",\n",
       " 'Insulin resistance is an important risk factor for alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Vice versa, heavy alcohol  consumption induces insulin resistance that is associated with progression of hepatic fibrosis in  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Insulin is the key hormone that regulates lipid and glucose  metabolism; it is also an important regulator of inflammation. Thus, hepatic insulin action is likely a key  player in the pathogenesis of ALD, yet the mechanisms through which impaired insulin action predisposes  to ALD remain poorly understood. We and others have previously demonstrated that insulin signaling within  the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) controls hepatic glucose production (hGP), very low density  lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis and innate immunity through the  autonomic nervous system. Based on our pilot data that demonstrate that in a rat model for binge drinking,  i.e. short term alcohol consumption impairs glucose tolerance and induces insulin resistance that is due to  impaired hepatic insulin action. Binge drinking markedly impairs hypothalamic insulin action, defined as the  ability of hypothalamic insulin to suppress hGP and adipose tissue lipolysis. Thus, the major hypothesis  proposed in this proposal is that some of the metabolic and innate immunity defects induced by alcohol are  caused through brain effects disrupting autonomic control of both metabolism and innate immunity. In  support ofthis novel paradigm we find that a central cause ofthe impaired hypothalamic insulin action is  decreased insulin signaling in the hypothalamus likely due to increased inflammation, ER stress and   expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase l b (PTPIb), a negative regulator of insulin signaling. Here we  propose to delineate the mechanisms through which chronic alcohol consumption impairs insulin action,  disrupts hepatic carbohydrate, amino acid and lipid metabolism and generates a pro-inflammatory  environment within the liver that predisposes to ALD.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY  Fibrinogen, coagulation factor VII (FVII) and factor VIII (FVIII), and its carrier protein von Willebrand factor (vWF) play key roles in modulating the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis. Similarly, D-dimer and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) reflect ongoing activation of the hemostatic system, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) is the principal inhibitor of tPA. These 7 factors reflect the primary hemostasis phenotypes that have been most commonly measured in population-based studies of healthy adults. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) successfully identified 70 loci contributing to these clinically relevant phenotypes related to thrombosis and hemostasis. The availability of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in many of the studies that contributed to these initial efforts will now allow us to expand our knowledge of the genetic variation contributing to plasma levels of these hemostasis traits. The goal of the proposed research is to utilize existing WGS-related resources in multi-ethnic studies to facilitate new genomic discovery in clinically-relevant phenotypes related to thrombosis and hemostasis.  We build upon a long-standing history of active collaboration and productivity, and have assembled the largest collection of studies with WGS data (n=37,036 individuals) and measurements for the 7 hemostasis phenotypes (fibrinogen, FVII, FVIII, vWF, D-dimer, tPa, and PAI-1). Generation of WGS data has been supported by NIH initiatives such as the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium, the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, the Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG), and others. This project provides a coordinated approach for detailed interrogation of genomic data by, (1) utilizing WGS from 10 multi-ethnic studies to assess the contribution of low frequency and rare genetic variation to 7 hemostasis phenotypes; (2) replicating significant findings in >135,000 individuals from an additional 26 studies with imputed genotypes based on TOPMed as a reference panel; and (3) integrating gene expression measurements with summary association statistics from a large- scale common variant GWAS for hemostasis traits involving all 36 studies, then using WGS to interrogate newly discovered genes. These approaches will identify genetic variation contributing to hemostasis traits that will then be evaluated for association with clinical outcomes (e.g., venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke).  This proposal brings together extensive WGS resources, hemostasis phenotypes, and capitalizes on advances in genomic technologies and computational analysis in order to contribute to the evidence base that may be used to deliver precision medicine in clinical settings.',\n",
       " 'Mammographic density (MD) and mutations in BRCA1 (BRCA1 MT) are two strong risk factors for breast cancer. Clarifying the molecular basis of the cancer risk in these highrisk women and identifying biomarkers to identify women who would benefit from closer surveillance and chemoprevention, and validating molecular pathways towards which approved therapies exist is clinically important. We found that the extracellular matrix (ECM) in women with high MD and those with BRCA1 MTs is stiffer and that a stiff ECM sensitizes mammary epithelial cells (MECs) to progesterone to induce more receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL). RANK stimulates breast cell growth, expands stem cells, and induces inflammation and breast cancer metastasis. We detected more RANKL in the breasts of women with high MD, and data suggest RANK receptors are higher in breast tissue from women with BRCA1 MTs who have more breast stem cells and develop triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Studies also suggest RANK activity may be higher in African American (AA) women who often develop TNBCs. Thus, we predict that risk to malignancy in women with high MD is fostered by a stiff ECM because it sensitives the epithelium to progesterone to increase RANK signaling that drives breast cell growth and tissue inflammation and expands breast stem cell frequency. This phenotype could also explain the predilection to develop TNBCs in other high-risk women with BRCA1 MTs and AA women who prior studies suggest may have higher RANK signaling. We will test this by: 1) Determining in mouse models if tissue mechanics drives mammary gland transformation and metastasis by enhancing Rank signaling and driving cell growth and inflammation and stem cell expansion. 2) Exploring associations and causality between Rank, inflammation and stem cell frequency and ECM stiffness in breast tissue from women at high risk for cancer and those who develop TNBCs, and in breast tissue from BRCA1 MT women treated with the RANKL inhibitor Denosumab. 3) Determining how ECM stiffness sensitives MECs to progesterone, and if the breast tissue in women at higher risk to malignancy or TNBCs are intrinsically sensitive to progesterone or RANKL. The studies will: 1) Identify RANK signaling as a biomarker for breast cancer risk and TNBCs and will provide evidence to support chemoprevention trials using RANKL inhibitors. 3) Provide a biological basis for the increased risk conferred by MD, 4) Clarify mechanisms whereby BRCA1 MTs increase breast cancer and provide biomarkers to stratify risk in this population. 5) Obtain insight into the biological basis of the aggressive TNBC breast cancers in AA women.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of the project is to understand the causes of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD). In HD polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin (Httexp) causes early synaptic dysfunction and eventual neurodegeneration through poorly understood mechanisms. We previously discovered that Httexp binds to and sensitizes inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 (InsP3R1) to InsP3. We also demonstrated that a novel inhibitor of neuronal store-operated calcium entry (nSOC) improved motor symptoms in transgenic HD flies and inhibited and neurodegeneration in YAC128 HD mouse medium spiny neurons (MSNs), the primary cell type affected in HD. Based on these results, we propose that excessive activation of InsP3R1 causes a persistent reduction in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium levels, elevated nSOC and neuronal and dendritic spine loss in HD-afflicted MSNs. To test this hypothesis, we will focus on the following aims: 1. To evaluate the causes and importance of supranormal nSOC in synaptic loss in HD MSNs To test the role of InsP3R1, we will use antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to knockdown InsP3R1 expression in YAC128 MSNs. We will also reduce levels of InsP3 by overexpressing a 5PP-RA phosphatase that metabolizes InsP3. To test the role of nSOC more directly we will use genetic strategies to knockout or knockdown STIM2, a regulator of synaptic nSOC. The effects of suppression of InsP3R1- and STIM2- mediated signaling will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo in experiments with the YAC128 HD mouse model. 2. To investigate the role of sigma 1 receptor (S1R) in HD and to evaluate S1R as a potential therapeutic target. Sigma 1 receptor (S1R) is an ER-resident protein that is activated in response to ER stress and ER calcium depletion. Activated S1R is thought to promote neuroprotection and stabilize InsP3R function, which may protect MSNs and their synaptic connections. Our preliminary data indicates upregulation of S1R in the striatum of both aged YAC128 mice and human HD patients. We will study changes in S1R- mediated signaling in the HD-afflicted striatum and investigate the potential relationship between S1R and ER Ca2+ signaling in HD MSN spines. We will also use a variety of pharmacological and molecular tools to validate S1R as a novel therapeutic target for HD. In these studies we will evaluate potential roles of dysregulated ER Ca2+ signaling, nSOC and S1R in synaptic loss in HD MSNs. We will also appraise InsP3R1, STIM2 and S1R as potential therapeutic targets for HD.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly-inherited, untreatable neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration associated with CAG repeat expansions in the gene, CACNA1A. Our recent evidence suggests that the disease is attributable to expression of a polyQ repeat expansion within a second CACNA1A gene product, a1ACT, that normally serves as a transcription factor (TF) critical for cerebellar cortical development, and that arises through the action of a cryptic cellular internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) within the coding region. SCA6-sized polyQ expansions in the ?1ACT TF interrupt its cellular and molecular function, cause cell death in vitro, ataxia and cortical thinning. The long-term goal of this project is to understand te pathogenesis of SCA6 by characterizing how a1ACTSCA6 alters gene expression, by confirming the role of the CACNA1A IRES in vivo and by developing a screening strategy for potential IRES-inhibiting compounds as potential therapies. Specifically we propose to ask: 1. Does the SCA6 polyQ expansion in a1ACT in the transcription factor (a1ACTSCA6) changes the gene binding patterns and the expression patterns of Purkinje cell genes? We will utilize chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to analyze in detail binding profiles of a1ACTWT and a1ACTSCA6 expressed in PC12 cells and isolate RNA from Purkinje cells of mice expressing a1ACTWT or a1ACTSCA6 to generate global gene expression profiles by RNA-seq to correlate a1ACTWT-DNA binding with transcriptional activity and to identify allele-specific changes in gene expression patterns. 2. Does a1ACT expression by CACNA1A IRES and promoter reproduce the normal and pathological functions of ?1ACT? We will generate new lines of a1ACT transgenic mice that will only yield a1ACTWT or a1ACTSCA6 protein by CAP-independent translation, and use the tet-off expression system to drive conditional expression and use a CACNA1A-tTA transgene to generate an endogenous pattern of expression. 3. Can we identify IRES-directed molecules that selectively suppress ?1ACT translation, but not a1A subunit expression? We will use our dual-luciferase bicistronic reporter to determine the optimal RNA sequences involved in IRES function, identify the ITAFs by EMSA and predict the secondary structure of CACNA1A IRES. We will carry out a high throughput screening assay to identify compounds that interfere with ?1ACT IRES function.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT  Microsatellite Instability (MSI), the spontaneous loss or gain of nucleotides from repetitive DNA tracts, is a molecular phenotype in oncology that is associated with genomic hypermutability and mutations in DNA repair enzymes. Although originally described in colorectal tumors, MSI has lately been regarded with newfound importance for cancers in general, owing to the recent discoveries that MSI-affected tumors are susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, and that MSI is a generalized tumor phenotype found across virtually all cancer types. Despite its emerging importance as a powerful pan-cancer therapeutic marker, existing diagnostics for MSI are limited in throughput, sensitivity, specificity, quantitation, prognostic capabilities, and generality across tumor types, among other important features. There is consequently a need for clinical diagnostics with improved performance and enhanced diagnostic capabilities. We have recently developed a new experimental paradigm (smMIP capture) that can overcome these limitations. In our approach, each copy of a target sequence that is present in a sample is molecularly tagged during the first cycle of a multiplex capture reaction with a unique random sequence. After amplification, target amplicons and their corresponding molecular tags are subjected to massively parallel sequencing. During analysis, the molecular tags are used to associate sequence reads sharing a common origin. Through oversampling, reads bearing the same molecular tag error-correct one another to yield an independent haploid consensus for each progenitor molecule, effectively bypassing length-altering slippage mutations which occur at repetitive microsatellite tracts (?stutter? artifact) and enabling sensitive quantitation of even low prevalence microsatellite mutations. Among other benefits, the approach is scalable to large numbers of genomic targets and is sensitive to at least 1 variant in a background of 10,000 unmutated templates. Here we propose the advanced development and validation of smMIP capture as a clinical diagnostic for MSI. In our first Aim, we will develop a multiplexed panel to broadly target ~1,000 highly informative microsatellite loci, as well as protocols and analytic methods for its use and interpretation. In our second Aim, we will define clinical performance characteristics of the assay, and will validate it against existing, clinical standard-of-care MSI diagnostics. In our third Aim, we will apply the smMIP panel prospectively in a clinical trial cohort, and assess its potential impact on clinical care and correlation with patient outcomes compared to standard testing. This work will provide information and deliverables with direct, transformative benefit cancer to patients, by expanding the scope of MSI testing across tumor types, and by providing better stratification for immunotherapy treatment, prognostic estimation, and quantitative data on mutational burden that is biologically-meaningful for understanding patient outcomes and identifying MSI subtypes.',\n",
       " 'The synaptic connections in our brain form circuits that control all mental activity and behavior. How these connections are specified during brain development and function is largely unknown. The problem is difficult to study in humans or model mammals because the synaptic connections in the large brains of these species cannot currently be determined. Some mental illnesses may be due to abnormalities in synaptic connectivity?the inability to address this possibility in the absence of known connectivity is a major barrier to understanding such diseases. This study focusses on specification of synaptic connectivity in the only animal where detailed maps of synaptic connections are available. In the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, the wiring diagram, or connectome, of the entire nervous system has been determined. The C. elegans genome contains a similar set of neural cell adhesion genes thought to specify connectivity as humans. The function of these and additional genes will be studied in a neural network in the male. The expression patterns of neural cell adhesion genes in the neural network has been determined. The function of multiple neural cell adhesion genes in specification of a particular synaptic connection will be examined in detail in genetic and molecular studies. The binding properties of neural cell adhesion proteins involved in synapse formation will be determined in biochemical studies. The complement of neural cell adhesion genes that specify different connections will be compared and their activities in ectopic contexts will be examined. The aim is to uncover the molecular determinants of connectivity in the network. The results will allow studies in higher animals to focus on genes with known functions in defining neural circuits.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT DESCRIPTION / SUMMARY Much of our collective knowledge on vascular growth has emerged from efforts to understand angiogenesis, a process by which endothelial cells depart from pre-existent vessels to form new vascular beds. Nonetheless, once formed, vascular tubes also expand in width, length, and are able to regenerate. Regeneration is extremely important to the repair of endothelial damage imposed by stents and other medical devises, as well as to mediate heal after physical/chemical trauma. However our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate endothelial growth and regeneration within the context of a fully functional, blood perfused and pulsatile vessel are limited. Our preliminary data show that expansion of the tunica intima in vivo occurs through intrinsic proliferation of intimal endothelial cells in a polarized and organized manner. In fact, a subset of endothelial cells flanking a wound are robustly induced to enter into the cell cycle as quickly as 12 hours following injury in a highly synchronized fashion. The process is initiated by changes in cell-cell junctions that trigger molecular rewiring and impressive physiological changes. Important outcomes of these responses include alterations in endothelial cell polarity, induction of chromatin remodeling, adjustments in metabolism and a quick emergence of a transcriptional signature that is unique to regenerative endothelium. This newly identified signature is finely tuned by the timed release of stress signals that appear to act differentially in the subsets of endothelial cells, revealing an intrinsic heterogeneity that controls the threshold for regeneration in a given vessel. In fact, genetic tracing analysis using endothelial-specific rainbow mice revealed the presence of cells with different proliferative potential suggesting the intercalation of progenitors within the wall of the endothelial monolayer. Taken together, these studies are paradigm shifting for understanding the mechanisms controlling endothelial regeneration and their deregulations in settings like chronic/acute inflammation, aging, chronic diseases and physical trauma. Through this NHLBI Outstanding Investigator Award application our goals are to (1) decode the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the process of endothelial expansion within a formed vessel; (2) clarify the process involved in endothelial regeneration and repair: (3) understand how hijacking these mechanisms might either accelerate or impair endothelial regeneration; (4) identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at endothelial repair during stenting or other injuries. These series of broadly defined aims have been conceptualize to fill gaps of our knowledge on fundamental biological processes in endothelial cell biology but also to exploit this information for application during medical interventions such as stent coverage. We are energized by the opportunity afforded by this grant mechanism and for the potential translational impact of these studies.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT:  The rapid drug sensitivity assessment from a panel of drugs within the tumor environment can realize the potential of individualized medicine in oncology. Our current work includes numerous collaborations that illustrate how the technology will be used in the future. We identified three areas i) in vivo use in a clinical setting, ii) ex vivo use in a clinical setting, iii) preclinical use to relate molecular phenotype of cancer to drug response. The focus of this R33 proposal is to address the major feasibility gaps that we identified for these uses. The gaps are identified in the following aims:  Aim 1: Increasing the yield of sample collection in a surgical setting. Clinical users achieved very low successful sample recovery in our early experiments compared with our trained technical staff in a preclinical environment. This aim will develop technology to achieve high sample yield with comparatively less skilled operators.   Aim 2: Increasing the rate at which individual devices can be loaded with many chemotherapeutic agents. Many important preclinical experiments require numbers of devices that exceed that which that can be prepared using our current method. Reservoir filling currently takes between 30 and 45 minutes for each device. This aim will reduce the time required to of the order of one minute with higher reliability.  Aim 3: Decreasing the time required to analyze the large number of histology slides that result from any one experiment. Microdosing using our device dramatically increases the number of histological sections that must be interpreted. Secondly, unprecedented spatial precision and accuracy are required to collocate the section with individual reservoirs on the device. This aim will ensure the spatial accuracy and not sacrifice the rate at which samples can be processed.   Our innovations center on addressing each of these gaps. Specifically, we have designed and prototyped and specialized biopsy instrument that will retrieve the device and surrounding tissue while being operated by a surgeon. Secondly, we have designed a dispensing device that can fill devices with 18 different drugs at high rates with the required accuracy and is capable of producing dozens such devices in a lot. Finally, we have prototyped a system to that can make precision specimens for histology and the resulting slides can be analyzed at high rates.  ',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Our knowledge of cochlear mechanics is currently undergoing a revolution. While the basilar membrane (BM) has long been considered the principal structure in cochlear motion, new techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have instead revealed not only that the reticular lamina (RL) moves in a different pattern from the BM, but that it moves 3?10 times more at low input sound levels. Additionally, RL motion is closer to the inner-hair-cell (IHC) stereocilia, making it more relevant than BM motion for triggering the output of the cochlea. The greater motion of the RL compared to the BM also suggests that RL motion may be the main source of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). Another long-held idea ? now realized to be inadequate ? is that the IHC stereocilia are driven only by shearing action between the RL and tectorial membrane (TM). Current evidence suggests that rotation of the RL and oscillatory fluid flow in the sub-tectorial space between the RL and TM also drive IHC stereocilia, and may even be more important than RL?TM shearing. We hypothesize that the stereocilia bundles of the IHCs are stimulated by multiple mechanisms, including classic RL-TM shearing, oscillatory fluid flow in the sub-tectorial space, and tilting of the RL near the IHC bundles; that the relative influence of these mechanisms changes with frequency, sound level, and species; and that OAE generation is dominated by RL motion. To test these hypotheses, a high-resolution OCT system (approx. 3 Âµm axial resolution) will be used to image and measure motions in the organ of Corti (OoC) in normal-hearing gerbils and mice, and in three mouse varieties with genetic mutations that affect the structure and mechanical properties of the TM. We will measure the transverse and radial motions of the BM, RL, and TM in response to acoustic stimulation at multiple sound levels and multiple cochlear locations. For comparisons to human hearing, responses will be measured from 0.5 to 12 kHz locations in gerbil and from 9 to 20 kHz locations in mouse. To translate the measured OoC motions into a detailed understanding of the mechanisms responsible for IHC and OHC stimulation and stimulus-frequency OAE production, we will use the OCT images to construct 3D cochlea finite-element models for gerbil and each mouse variety, and will test the models against the OCT vibrometry measurements. The models will contain, in a viscous-fluid environment, the key elements of OoC cytoarchitecture sandwiched between the BM and RL, including the pillar cells, three rows of outer hair cells, and IHCs, along with the TM, which together will allow clear relationships to be established between cochlear function and the structure and material composition of the OoC. This will improve our understanding of the various mechanical stages of hearing, will allow the health and structure of the OoC to be correlated with OAEs for diagnostic purposes, and will provide a powerful and efficient modeling framework appropriate for the future development of human cochlear models that can be validated using non-invasive hearing-threshold and OAE measurements.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating inflammatory bowel disease affecting approximately 10% of premature infants born <1500gm. There is currently no means of predicting, preventing, or specifically treating this disease. The two primary risk factors for NEC are prematurity and bacterial colonization. This proposal is focused on understanding the function of the early intestinal microbiota. Specifically, the goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of early human microbiota in the development of the immature intestine, and the mechanism by which this microbiota-host interaction alters susceptibility to NEC. Based on preliminary data demonstrating differences in the microbial communities of preterm infants who do or do not develop NEC, and differences in inflammatory signaling and barrier function associated with different preterm infant microbial communities, we hypothesize that optimal early microbial intestinal colonization enhances development of the immature preterm gut and exhibits stability despite clinical perturbations thus protecting against NEC. We propose to investigate the role of early microbial communities in infants who ultimately develop or do not develop NEC by using 1. Metagenomic sequencing to determine differences in functional microbial gene sequence of the overall community; 2. Germ-free mouse transfaunation to investigate the effect of the early microbial community on intestinal phenotype; 3. Chemostat bioreactors to measure the stability of the microbial community and volatile organic compounds (VOC) produced in response to clinically relevant perturbations; 4. Enteroid culture models to investigate mechanistic links between VOCs produced and inflammation or barrier function alterations in immature intestinal epithelial cells. Use of human preterm infant samples will ensure clinical relevance. We also propose to create defined experimental communities (DECs) of cultured organisms that are representative of the early microbiota from infants who do or do not go on to develop NEC. These DECs can form the basis for a potential future microbial ecotherapeutic intervention to optimize microbial colonization patterns in premature infants to promote normal intestinal development and prevent NEC in these vulnerable patients. These studies will also allow assessment of microbial community stability to enable understanding of how clinical interventions early in life are influencing this critical earl microbiota, to prompt informed clinical practice alterations.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Semi-occluded vocal tract (SOVT) therapy is widely used to treat various voice disorders, including vocal fold lesions and primary muscle tension dysphonia. The mechanism of SOVT therapy has not been thoroughly studied. The added vocal tract, which is often a straw, changes both supraglottal acoustic impedance, and static supraglottal pressure; however, how these parameters independently contribute to the voice therapy have not been clarified. We would like to observe the supraglottal effects as well as the acoustic impedance effects of phonation independently and quantitatively. Our long-term aim is to improve upon current methods of SOVT therapy by exploring the underlying mechanisms and finding the optimal SOVT configurations that allow for the greatest increase in best quality of phonation. The proposed research consists of two independent phases. During Phase I, an excised canine larynx model will be used for the independent scientific evaluation and optimization of three variables in SOVT therapy ? (1) length of vocal tract extension, (2) vocal tract outlet constriction, and (3) regulated supraglottal pressure input. Extending the length and constricting the outlet of the vocal tract increases the acoustic impedance which then increases supraglottal pressure and the ease of phonation. The use of a regulated pressure input is a novel addition to SOVT therapy, which allows the supraglottal pressure to be directly controlled. Wide ranges of each SOVT variable will be examined individually to determine the optimal levels of each modification. Vocal phonation will be systematically monitored through dependent aerodynamic, electroglottographic, and acoustic parameters, including vocal efficiency. During Phase II, in human subjects, we will independently assess the three variables of SOVT therapy on subjects with and without hyperfunctional voice disorders. The results from the studies using an ex-vivo model gives information based solely on the mechanism, with an unscaled pattern; whereas, Phase II studies will give insight into the dynamic and behavioral reactions present in human subjects. Effects on vocal economy will be evaluated using aerodynamic, electroglottographic, and acoustic parameters as dependent variables. Through a standardized therapeutic task, the effect of the modifications of SOVT therapy can be isolated. The studies outlined in this proposal will evaluate optimal SOVT therapy configurations through independently testing the three SOVT modifications. Further, we also will include long and short duration therapeutic tasks. By testing each modification across different task durations, we can identify the minimal task duration to achieve significant benefits. Monitoring the immediate and long-term effects allows further insight on the overall impact that this voice therapy can have.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary/ Abstract The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are both critical for learning and memory-guided behavior, with the hippocampus necessary for rapid episodic learning and memory, and PFC playing an integral role in long- term memory, retrieval, working memory and decision making. Coordination of neural activity between these regions is necessary for these cognitive processes, however, it is still unclear what features of neural activity mediate interactions for communication of memory-related information, and the explicit roles of these activity patterns in learning, retrieval and decision making. This proposal will investigate the roles of prominent physiological network patterns by combining behavioral methods in rats, high-density recording, and a novel closed-loop optogenetic perturbation technique that can detect network patterns in real-time and disrupt inter- regional coordination. First, we will simultaneously and continuously monitor activity of neural populations in the hippocampus and PFC over the course of learning of a novel spatial memory task. Previous work suggests that two prominent patterns can mediate hippocampal-prefrontal interactions; coherence during theta oscillations associated with place cell activity, and coordinated reactivation of behavioral experiences during awake sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). We will test if awake SWR reactivation during initial exploration supports memory formation by establishing associations between hippocampal-prefrontal neurons, and if theta coherence mediates retrieval of these associations during later exploitation to support ongoing decision making. Next we will use real-time detection and closed-loop optogenetic perturbation to disrupt coordination during specific physiological patterns. We will test if disrupting coordinated reactivation using optogenetic perturbation of prefrontal reactivation during awake hippocampal SWRs impairs memory formation and behavioral learning. Further, we will test if disrupting phase-locked prefrontal spiking during theta coherence impairs retrieval and memory-guided decision making. Finally, we will investigate if reactivation during sleep and awake SWRs play different roles in learning. We will examine differences in prefrontal reactivation for awake vs. sleep SWRs, and test the causal role of sleep SWRs in consolidation by disrupting prefrontal reactivation during sleep. Together, these aims will provide an integrated, causal understanding of the role of prominent network activity patterns in hippocampal-prefrontal interactions necessary for learning and memory- guided behavior. This proposal will thus provide crucial insight into memory disorders associated with these regions such as dementia, PTSD, Alzhiemer's disease, and also neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.\",\n",
       " \"In 2011, 721,800 healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) were reported in the United States. Daily and terminal disinfection of hospital areas such as patient rooms are critically important to help prevent HAI and involve extensive disinfection of the room before a new patient is admitted to the room. Additionally, portable medical equipment (PME) has been implicated in outbreaks of HAIs and the importance of systematic disinfection of PME has been recognized and included in infection control guidelines. Although the Joint Commission requires documentation of disinfection of hospital areas and PME, there is no systematic solution for tracking disinfection methods, location, personnel, and time/date of disinfection. Xenex proposes to beta-test a disinfection tracking system (DTS) based on a patent application licensed from the Veterans' Affairs (VA) Department and Phase I SBIR work, which will have the following capabilities: a display of disinfection status, RFID and sensors to manually or automatically detect a disinfection event, and cloud-based software to analyze disinfection practices. At the conclusion of the proposed project, a fully vetted beta device will have been create and field tested, including studies on the impact of the DTS on microbial contamination as well as user feedback and human factors information. At the completion of this project, we expect to be ready to field test the final design at parter sites and then begin marketing the product. This project will involve systematic observation of disinfection events in an acute care setting with and without the DTS present. The project team will consist of the same sites and PI/co- PIs as the Phase I SBIR. Our long-term goal is to improve patient outcomes through reducing the risk of contaminated surfaces and PME through fully commercializing the DTS.\",\n",
       " \"Project Summary/Abstract Symptoms of insomnia and anxiety are common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and detract from quality of life. These symptoms are further exacerbated in the setting of mental health disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although patients with COPD and comorbid PTSD may experience temporary relief from the use of benzodiazepines, these medications pose significant risks. In patients with COPD, benzodiazepine use is associated with a 45% increased risk of exacerbations, and increased risks for respiratory failure and mortality?although our understanding of these risks is incomplete. In patients with PTSD, benzodiazepine use reinforces PTSD symptoms, impairs recovery, and increases the risk of subsequent substance abuse. Given these findings, guidelines have advocated against the routine use of benzodiazepines in patients with either COPD or PTSD, although there may be utility for use in end-of-life symptom palliation. Despite these recommendations, we found that benzodiazepines are used in 35% of patients with COPD and comorbid PTSD in the Veteran's Health Administration (VA). This rate of use is approximately seven times that observed in the general population. We hypothesize that system level factors such as lower center volume, and lower complexity of care provided will be associated with benzodiazepine use after adjustment for patient level factors. Furthermore, as each condition predisposes patients to unique risks related to benzodiazepine use, we hypothesize that the use of benzodiazepines in patients with COPD and comorbid PTSD will result in excess mortality. The current project seeks to test these hypotheses in three aims: 1) identify predictors of chronic benzodiazepine use in a national population of patients with COPD and comorbid PTSD, 2) evaluate mortality risk related to chronic benzodiazepine use in patients with COPD and comorbid PTSD in a propensity-matched cohort, and 3) identify patient and provider perspectives regarding the use of benzodiazepine medications to reduce anxiety and insomnia symptoms in patients with COPD and comorbid PTSD. Knowledge of predictors and perspectives regarding benzodiazepine use gained from accomplishing aims 1 and 3 will inform targets for de-implementation of guideline inconsistent benzodiazepine use, and knowledge gained from aim 2 will help gauge the potential mortality impact of such an intervention. Future efforts aimed at de-implementation will focus on the substitution of alternative agents and education regarding the harms of benzodiazepine use in this setting.  \",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The leading cause of death in the US is heart disease, and the global problem of obesity is an important risk factor. Additionally, the offspring of overweight and obese women are more likely than those born to normal- weight women to develop cardiovascular disease as adults. This is especially distressing because over two- thirds of reproductive-age women are overweight or obese in the US. Work in mice has shown that maternal obesity programs mitochondrial dysfunction via germ-line changes and transmission of damaged oocyte mitochondria across three generations. The long-term goals of this applicant are to define the mechanisms by which maternal obesity impairs cardiac health in subsequent, non-obese generations and identify therapies to prevent adverse outcomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop a multigenerational model of cardiac deficiencies arising from maternal obesity. This model will then be used to test the central hypothesis that impaired cardiac function in offspring is due to a feed-forward loop in which offspring inherit damaged mitochondria that disrupt energy signaling, leading to further mitochondrial damage. This hypothesis is founded on preliminary and published work showing that when mice (F0) were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose diet from before conception and through weaning, they gained significant weight and developed peripheral insulin resistance; their F1 progeny developed heart disease as adults; and their F1, F2, and F3 descendants had misshapen and dysfunctional mitochondria in their skeletal muscle and oocytes, despite consuming a control diet. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two aims. Aim 1 will establish a multigenerational model of cardiac deficiencies arising from maternal obesity. Echocardiography will be used to measure cardiac function and high- resolution respirometry will be used to measure mitochondrial function in the F1 through F3 offspring of obese F0 dams. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that F1 through F3 offspring of obese dams have disturbed cardiac function due to defective cardiac mitochondria, disrupted autophagy, and increased lipid storage. Offspring will be treated with an activator of the low-energy state sensing protein AMP-activate protein kinase (AMPK). Activation of AMPK should enhance autophagy, and therefore result in diminished lipid droplet quantity and removal of dysfunctional/damaged mitochondria. Moreover, activation of AMPK should increase fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis, replenishing the pool of healthy mitochondria and restoring cardiac metabolic homeostasis, ultimately improving cardiovascular health. Completion of these aims will yield several basic science outcomes that are significant because they will add to our understanding of the relationship between maternal obesity and offspring cardiovascular health. The proposed studies support a postdoctoral training plan that includes interdisciplinary technical training, scientific meetings, and consultation with leaders in both cardiovascular and developmental biology fields, which will prepare the applicant to transition to independence as an investigator.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary RUNX1 is a major hematopoietic transcription factor and RUNX1 haplodeficiency (RHD) is characterized by familial thrombocytopenia and impaired platelet function. We have a longstanding interest in the molecular basis of inherited platelet dysfunction, particularly related to RHD. Numerous platelet abnormalities have been described in RHD, several by us, and include deficiencies of dense granule (DG) and ?-granules (AG). Our platelet expression profiling studies in a patient with RHD showed that several genes are down regulated (MYL9, PRKCQ, ALOX12, PF4, PLDN, PCTP); and we have shown that these are direct RUNX1 transcriptional targets and impact platelet/megakaryocyte (MK) biology. The overall objective of this proposal is to obtain new insights into the mechanisms of endocytosis, vesicle trafficking, and ?-granule formation in platelets/MK through the study of phenotypic abnormalities and genes dysregulated in RHD. This project builds on unique abnormalities identified by us in RHD. We have reported in our patient that platelet albumin and IgG (incorporated by bulk endocytosis into AG) are decreased. Our expression profiling studies show that platelet RAB1B, RAB31 and DNM3 ? three GTPases closely linked to vesicle trafficking are decreased. Little is currently known regarding the mechanisms regulating endocytosis in platelets/MK or the role of these GTPases. Our hypothesis is that mechanisms of endocytosis and vesicle trafficking are impaired in RHD. Aim 1 is to obtain insights into mechanisms regulating endocytosis in platelets/MK through the study of mechanisms leading to the decreased platelet albumin and IgG in RHD. We will study uptake and transport of albumin and IgG in normal and RHD platelets, study the effect of downregulation of RUNX1, RAB1B, RAB31 and DNM3 on these processes in MK, perform studies using markers of secretory and endocytic pathways of vesicle trafficking. Aim 2 is to understand the mechanisms leading to AG deficiency in RHD. We will study: platelet AG in normal and RHD platelets focusing on selected AG proteins; the effect of downregulation of RUNXI, RAB1B, RAB31and DNM3 on AG and trafficking of AG proteins in MK. These studies will be performed on 5-6 patients with RHD and using induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) already developed from a RHD patient. They will provide important new insights into endocytosis and vesicle trafficking in platelets/MK, about which little is presently known. Relevance Platelets play a major role in hemostasis, thrombosis, inflammation, atherosclerosis and handling of pathogens. Our studies will provide new information on the basic aspects of platelet/MK function through studies in human RUNX1 haplodeficiency, a unique reservoir of information. This information will lay the foundation for new therapeutic approaches for both thrombotic and bleeding disorders.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract There is no validated assay to reliably detect the early onset of the Lyme disease infection at the time when antibiotic therapy has the best chance of a cure without sequelae. Diagnosis is often difficult because most symptoms are often nebulous, with the telltale ?bulls-eye? rash only appearing and clearly recognizable in approximately half of cases. The standard types of infectious diagnostic tests ? both culture and serology ? require >3 weeks for a positive result after the onset of infection with Lyme disease and serology only indicates exposure but not active infection. This introduces a significant delay in treatment. While PCR for B. burgdorferi DNA in the blood has potential for a rapid, accurate result, past tests have not had sufficient sensitivity because of too few bacteria and low copy numbers of DNA in the blood. We have developed an approach that ?enlarges the targetability?, by 160,000 fold, thereby increasing the sensitivity of PCR test for B. burgdorferi. Our data show we are successfully accomplishing this by: using a larger amount of blood to start (10 fold); then selectively multiplying the target by using Borrelia-directed primers prior to PCR (2000 fold); and then probing the product for the B. burgdorferi on a multi-loci PCR platform (8 fold). To assure reliability and acceptance of a new test based on this approach, we formally consulted with the FDA from the beginning. We obtained a Qsub (pre-IDE) approval with guidance as to what we need for a cleared test. During this proposal we will continue to test blood samples (from eventually confirmed Lyme cases and control subjects) with our PCR-based assay at the time the patient presents to the doctor in order to prove the assay can detect the B. burgdorferi infection, earlier and with greater sensitivity, than the FDA benchmark of two-tiered serology taken at the same time. If successful, at the number agreed on with the FDA, this Phase II should result in a test that has FDA clearance. Our goal is deliver a functional and affordable diagnostic assay for Early Onset Lyme Disease that has superior sensitivity and specificity compared to two-tiered serology. The test will permit immediate diagnosis well before seroconversion or cultures become positive so treatment can be started right away.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The major goal of this NCI Clinical and Translational R21 application is to reveal the cancer therapeutic and diagnostic potentials of a novel antibody-like chimeric fusion protein, Avaren-Fc lectibody (AvFc), in mouse tumor models. AvFc consists of the high mannose glycan (HMG)-specific lectin Avaren and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of human immunoglobulin (Ig)G1. Recent studies have revealed that HMGs are elevated on the cell surface glycome of various tumors. In normal cells, these glycans are processed into more complex forms in the endomembrane system and therefore rarely found on cell surface. Hence, HMGs may provide a new target for cancer therapy and/or diagnosis. However, there is currently no agent selectively targeting tumor-associated HMGs. Our preliminary data showed that AvFc is capable of binding to a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines, including leukemia, melanoma, and lung, breast, colon and cervical cancers, but not to noncancerous human cells. Additionally, AvFc exhibited strong antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity against various cancer cells tested. AvFc showed good safety profiles in mice upon repeated systemic administration. Lastly, AvFc is efficiently bioproduced in tobacco plants using a plant virus vector. Given these promising developability profile, we hypothesize that AvFc could be developed as a first-in-class cancer therapeutic and/or diagnostic agent targeting tumor-associated HMGs. To prove this hypothesis we propose two specific aims in this application. In Aim 1, we will investigate AvFc's anti-tumor activity in murine tumor challenge models. We will use well-established syngeneic and human tumor xenograft models to determine the effectiveness of AvFc. In Aim 2, we will employ dynamic positron emission tomography scan and radiolabeled AvFc to determine their in vivo biodistribution and tumor specificity in mice. Additionally, we will attempt to isolate and identify tumor cell-surface glycoproteins targeted by AvFc, using a proteomics approach. Results generated in this project will provide a compelling preclinical data package for the development of AvFc as a novel therapeutic and/or diagnostic agent targeting tumor-associated HMGs. Additionally, our data will provide a new basis and a unique tool to investigate the as-yet-unknown roles and mechanisms of elevated HMGs in tumors.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract Interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment can facilitate tumor growth and progression by altering gene expression and modulating tumor cell behavior such as by enhancing growth, survival, spread or neovascularization. The transfer of bioactive molecules from one cell to another is a mechanism by which tumor cells interact with other cells within their microenvironment. Non-coding (nc) RNA molecules are capable of effecting genomic changes and can modulate gene expression. Thus, intercellular transfer of ncRNA provides a powerful mechanism by which tumor cells can epigenetically modify their environment. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which ncRNA are released within extracellular vesicles and their involvement in tumor cell-stromal cell interactions. The studies described are based on our observations of highly selective release of some ncRNA within extracellular vesicles from hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cells and their contribution to activation of cell signaling pathways in recipient cells. Using human HCC or myofibroblastic cell lines, patient-derived HCC, and primary human hepatic stellate cells, we will characterize vesicles and ncRNA that are functionally involved in inter-cellular RNA signaling. These studies will (a) identify extracellular vesicle ncRNA mediators of tumor-stromal interactions and their functional contribution to tumor growth, (b) define identifying characteristics of ncRNA-carrying vesicles and (c) evaluate ESCRT-II dependent mechanisms by which ncRNA are sorted for release within vesicles during tumor-stromal interactions. Using new approaches for the detection of RNA gene expression and inter-cellular transfer with in-vitro and in-vivo tumor-stromal cell co-culture models, these studies will define the mechanistic relationship between regulated release of extracellular vesicles, functional non-coding RNA and tumor cell- stromal cell interactions. Elucidating the essential contribution of inter-cellular RNA signaling to tumor growth will provide the basis for therapeutic strategies to target these interactions and mechanisms for the treatment or prevention of HCC.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary:  Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome resulting from loss of function mutations in the Nf2 gene locus, which codes for the protein, Merlin (Moesin-Ezrin- Radixin-Like Protein). Patients with NF2 suffer almost invariably from bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) and have a high propensity for sensorineural hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, and the development of meningiomas and ependymomas. Surgical resection is currently frontline therapy for the treatment of VS and the necessity for surgical margins can further compromise auditory, vestibular, and facial nerve function.  Merlin has an actin binding domain and localizes to the cortical membrane in the cell where it is believed to function as a negative regulator of cell growth during contact inhibition. In order to develop a better understanding of how loss of Merlin contributes to schwannoma genesis, the lab generated a murine model of NF2 in which Nf2flox/flox mice have been crossed with mice which express Cre recombinase driven by a 3.9kb fragment of the periostin (Postn) promoter. These Nf2f/f;Postn-Cre mice develop a clinical pathology similar to human NF2 patients with fully penetrant peripheral, vestibular, and dermal schwannomas along with sensorineural hearing loss.  We hypothesize that loss of Merlin drives oncogenic transformation of Schwann cells through up- regulation of the NF-?B pathway. In Aim 1, we will develop new tools to elucidate NF-kB signaling in our NF2 mouse model. By modulating the signaling of a specific NF-?B protein, we will attempt to prevent pathogenic schwannoma formation in our Merlin conditionally deficient animals and assess how tumor growth alters the sensorineural hearing loss. In Aim 2, we seek to modulate a therapeutically targetable protein as a way of ameliorating a particular disease process we have observed in the inner ear of our mice and that we hypothesize is primary driver of hearing loss in our mice. The studies in Aim 1 and 2 are designed to challenge the prevailing opinion about the pathophysiology driving sensorineural hearing loss in NF2. This proposal will lead to a better understanding of Merlin signaling and provide a data driven approach to how to think about and treat sensorineural hearing loss in NF2.',\n",
       " 'Summary  Endothelial cells play a critical role in multiple aspects of lung development and homeostasis, yet the precise mechanisms that regulate vasculogenesis and how endothelial cells signal to other cell types to orchestrate lung development have not been well defined. Accurate regulation of these processes is critical to ensure proper lung development and prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a lung disease of premature infants that often results in life-long complications. Hallmarks of BPD are impaired vasculature and arrested lung development. We created three-dimensional (3D) co-culture systems in which lung endothelial cells (LuMECs) drive the putative lung stem cells, BASCs, to produce bronchiolar or alveolar organoids. These organoid cultures provide an opportunity to model interactions that occur between endothelial cells and alveolar cells during lung development. Using this system, we discovered a novel BMP4-NFATc1- Thrombospondin (TSP1) pathway in endothelial and epithelial cells in the adult lung. We showed that TSP1, known as an anti-angiogenic factor, is required for the development of alveolar organoids. We also identified R-spondin2 (Rspo2), which regulates Wnt signaling in other systems, as a BMP4-regulated protein that may be downstream of TSP1 in endothelial cells. The mechanisms underlying TSP1 regulation of lung vascular development and alveolarization are unknown. We hypothesize that endothelial-derived TSP1 induced by BMP4-NFATc1 signaling inhibits pulmonary vascular development and is required for proper lung development. Further, we posit that vascular lung injury, such as that seen with hyperoxia exposure, impairs TSP1 signaling, thereby altering vasculogensis and blocking alveolar development. In Aim 1, we will determine how TSP1- CD47 interactions regulate vasculogenesis and lung development. Defective lung endothelial cells from mice exposed to hyperoxia will be used in lung organoid co-cultures to test the impact of impaired endothelial cell signals on alveolarization. Similarly, cells from knockout mice will be used in neonatal lung organoid cultures to determine the effect of CD47 deficiency on alveolar development. CD47-knockout mice and endothelial- specific TSP1-knockout mice will be used to test the role of TSP1-CD47 interactions in the response to neonatal hyperoxia-mediated lung vascular injury in vivo. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms by which TSP1-dependent Rspo2 mediates pulmonary vascular development by evaluating ligand response in vitro and after neonatal hyperoxic injury in vivo. Recombinant Rspo2 will be used in neonatal lung organoid cultures and in assays for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation. We will determine if lung endothelial cell secreted factors, and more specifically, Rspo2, is sufficient for prevention of neonatal hyperoxia-mediated lung injury. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which lung endothelial cells drive critical outcomes in development. This work will determine if defective TSP1-dependent signaling is a mechanism of interrupted lung development in premature infants with BPD, leading to new ways to direct therapy for BPD.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY A major regulator of synaptic function is local protein synthesis. Deep RNA sequencing has revealed that there are thousands of dendritically localized mRNAs. Local translation of selected mRNAs in dendrites provides a fast, adaptive mechanism for the experience-dependent formation of new synapses or the stability of pre- existing connections. This plasticity underlies changes in neuronal network dynamics and is therefore thought to be the foundation of learning and memory. Altered protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity are associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the pathways that regulate the dendritic proteome are not well understood. Protein synthesis in dendrites requires precise regulation of local mRNA stability and translation. A great amount of prior research has addressed the pathways that regulate translational derepression in dendrites. However, the mechanisms that control mRNA levels during synaptic function have not been demonstrated. We have recently shown that intra-axonal translation coupled to the mRNA-degradation pathway `Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay' (NMD) controls a switch in receptor expression and thereby regulates axon guidance; indicating that mRNA turnover is a key player in local protein synthesis. Currently, it is not known whether mRNA stability in dendrites contribute to the regulation of synaptic plasticity. The goal of this application is to understand the contribution of intra-dendritic translation coupled to mRNA- degradation pathway NMD to synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance. The synaptic plasticity protein Arc is a known target of NMD-mediated mRNA degradation, serving to limit the amount of Arc in dendrites. We have found that, in addition to Arc, NMD limits the amount of various other proteins involved in GluR1 regulation, which is essential for modulation of synaptic strength. Based on the published literature and our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that local NMD is as essential for synaptic function as it is for axon guidance. To test this hypothesis, we propose to determine whether NMD: 1) locally functions in dendrites; 2) promotes synaptic strength by restricting either internalization or translational repression of GluR1; 3) plays a role in different forms of synaptic plasticity (e.g. LTP and LTD); 4) is required for learning and memory. We will use a combination of techniques including a novel microfluidic device to uniquely study synaptic events, an inducible-genetic mouse model, electrophysiology and behavioral assays. Although NMD is the only RNA regulatory pathway linked to numerous neurocognitive disorders, it represents a relatively unexplored mechanism for regulating synaptic function. The successful completion of this research will provide a coherent view of local proteome dynamics in synaptic plasticity and might be valuable for providing new insights into the mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction and neurocognitive diseases.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract This grant request is for the third ?Emerging Issues in Cochlear Implantation? conference organized by the non-profit American Cochlear Implant Alliance (ACIA) to be held March 8-10, 2018 in Washington, DC. The first two such conferences were held in October 2013 and 2015; both were supported by NIH R13 Conference Grants. The timeframe for this conference has been moved from Fall to early Spring to avoid conflicts with Fall meetings that some clinicians regularly attend. Conference attendance will span scientists and clinicians from across the cochlear implant (CI) continuum of care including otolaryngologists, audiologists, speech pathologists, psychologists, and others on CI teams. Secondary audiences for these topics include health insurance plan representatives and Federal and state employees including CMS, Tricare, and the VA. The emerging issues format allows an in-depth look at topics needing greater exploration and clinical guidance to advance the field. With CI candidacy expansion, there is a need to address ways to appropriately serve new recipients as well as previously implanted individuals who require care throughout their lifetime. In the pediatric realm, for children who are prelingually deaf and identified at birth, there is a need for parents to be counseled as to how to support their CI child?s language development at an earlier age than has been typical in the past. Recent research supports pediatric CI at 12 months of age or less. The ACIA Board of Directors selected four topics determined to be particularly important to CI outcomes and access in the immediate future?topics that have not been thoroughly explored in a clinical research context specific to cochlear implant care. These themes, as well as submitted podium and poster talks, will provide timely research and clinical insights. The topics are consistent with feedback that ACIA has received from its members via conference surveys and other contacts. The four Emerging Issues are: (1) Parental Engagement in Pediatric CI Outcomes, (2) Quality of Life Associated with Cochlear Implantation, (3) Cochlear Implant Practice Management: Maximizing Value for Optimal Delivery of Care, and (4) CI Candidacy in 2018. In addition, attendees may submit abstracts to present papers or posters on related topics during the afternoon each day and on Saturday morning. Students are encouraged to submit poster presentations and there will be an opportunity for selected poster presenters to give brief (3 minute) podium highlight talks, a format that was used successfully at the 2017 San Francisco pediatric meeting. The Board Chair is the overall Conference Chair while the PI is the conference Co-Chair. Emerging Issues Chairs were selected by the Board for their specialized expertise in the topics. The Chairs then determined program focus. These individuals were drawn from universities and other clinical settings from around the country and serve as the Conference Organizing Committee. Invited speakers are from wide-spread clinical settings (university, private or non-profit clinic, hospital), and diverse geographic areas. Proceedings will be developed and published online open access to encourage the widest possible distribution to varied audiences.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an emerging epidemic of liver disease in the US and the basis for a rising incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH-associated fibrosis, regardless of other histologic features such as inflammation, is the major predictor of long-term outcomes in patients. Accordingly, there are increas- ing numbers of clinical drug trials to slow down or reverse fibrosis progression in patients with NASH. However, no drugs have been approved yet for widespread use. The direct fibrogenic mediators of liver fibrosis are he- patic stellate cells (HSCs), which become activated/differentiate into myofibroblasts that deposit excessive ex- tracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in an aberrant wound healing cascade. The stiff matrix produced by activated HSCs leads to the loss of major functions in hepatocytes. The differentiation of HSCs into myofibroblasts and their interactions with hepatocytes in NASH is the result of the complex crosstalk between numerous microen- vironmental signals. Thus, treating NASH-associated fibrosis effectively will require understanding and inter- rupting this complex crosstalk that distorts liver architecture and leads to liver decompensation. Differences across species in drug metabolism and disease pathways necessitate supplementation of animal data with human-relevant in vitro assays. Despite important progress in the development of culture techniques to stabilize the phenotype of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) in culture for several weeks, there is a need to develop a platform that enables the investigation of PHH-HSC interactions within physiological and disease settings. We have developed a cellular microarray that allows simultaneous modulation of the size/composition of patterned ECM protein domains, substrate stiffness, and soluble factor concentrations, while also enabling parallel measurements of cellular phenotype and contractility. Here, we will adapt this cellular microarray to test our hypothesis that the ECM protein composition, substrate stiffness, and soluble factors act collectively to modulate the phenotypes of PHHs and HSCs and their interactions in an NASH-like microenvironment. Our approach will enable hypothesis-driven studies incorporating controlled perturbations of extracellular signals. In aim 1, we will examine the effects of ECM composition and substrate stiffness on long-term phenotypic re- sponses of PHHs under normal and NASH-inducing conditions. In aim 2, we will investigate the cooperative microenvironmental regulation of the activation states of primary human HSCs. In aim 3, we will develop a co- culture approach to determine the roles of reciprocal interactions between PHHs and HSCs and establish a platform for evaluating NASH-relevant therapeutics. Our studies will reveal mechanisms underlying phenotypic alterations of human HSCs and PHHs, including interconnections between biochemical and biomechanical sig- nals. These efforts will aid the development of drugs aimed at reversing fibrosis.',\n",
       " 'Although hind limb remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is cardioprotective, the mechanism is unknown. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the mechanism of protection by remote hind-limb ischemia. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that transient ischemic episodes, away from the myocardial infarction (MI), contribute to the recovery through secretion of beneficial exosomes from skeletal muscle endocrine, improving mitochondrial metabolism, hydrogen sulfide (H2S, an anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, vasoactive gas) and mobilization of bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) to the site of injury (Figure 1). It is known that DNA hypermethylation by epigenetic modification inhibits the gene and produces homocysteine (Hcy), leading to hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) that decreases H2S. Interestingly, increase in cystathione ? synthase (CBS) and cystathionine ? lyase (CSE) enzymes increases H2S and decreases Hcy. Our preliminary data suggests that RIC induced musclin (a skeletal muscle hormone) attenuated myocardial muscle damage and dysfunction. The central hypothesis will be tested by the following three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine whether the RIC releases exosomes, induces musclin and reverses compromised skeletal and cardiac muscle function during MI and diabetes.

       " 'Project Summary This 3-year Phase II SBIR Application focuses on advancing the lead ?ultra-broad-spectrum? carbapenem (USBC) VNRX-4099, possessing an unprecedented antibacterial spectrum of activity including MRSA, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to IND filing status. The UBSC VNRX-4099 will be paired with a proprietary in-house ?-lactamase inhibitor VNRX-5133 (BLI) to protect against resistance by Ambler Class A, B and D carbapenemase-producing Gram negatives. In parallel, a discovery effort will be executed to identify a fast follower and/or chemically-diverse back-up UBSC that could be advanced into IND-enabling studies if required. Ultimately, it is envisioned that this new combination product will provide a unique clinical option for empiric therapy of multi-drug resistant polymicrobial infections in the hospital general ward and ICU, and as a second line therapy for susceptible organisms.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Although potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV infection to undetectable levels of plasma viremia, the stably integrated HIV genome continues to persist as a viral reservoir in long lasting resting CD4+ T cells (rCD4). There is substantial ongoing effort to identify therapeutic approaches that will eliminate or reduce the size of this reservoir. However, clinical investigators lack a universal measure to assess whether or not a decrease in the latent reservoir has been achieved. The quantitative viral outgrowth assay (Q-VOA) which quantifies inducible, replication-competent HIV-1 from rCD4+ T cells, is used extensively to quantify size of latent viral reservoir, but it provides only a minimal definitive estimate of the size of the latent HIV-1 replication- competent pool. Additionally, the Q-VOA cannot be used to measure the size of the latent replication competent pool HIV-1 in tissues, which represents a major sanctuary site for latent HIV-1.Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a high throughput, sensitive, and well-validated assay that can quantify replication competent HIV-1 in blood and tissues which will help in developing strategies to eradicate HIV-1. We have recently published a reporter cell-based assay, termed TZA, to quantify inducible replication-competent latent HIV-1. TZA has several advantages over existing technologies in that it (i) is more sensitive; (ii) requires only a small blood volume and (iii) is significantly faster and less labor intensive. Using this assay we show that the size of the inducible latent HIV-1 reservoir in aviremic participants on ART is approximately 70-fold larger than previous estimates. The primary goal of this application is to further develop and characterize this assay so that it can be universally used to quantify the pool of replication-competent HIV-1 in blood and tissues. The Specific Aims of the project are: 1) To characterize the inducible replication-competent latent HIV-1 reservoir in the blood of infected subjects using the TZA. To achieve this goal, we will validate the TZA in the HIV Reservoir Assay Validation and Evaluation Network (RAVEN) project by comparing its sensitivity, dynamic range, and reproducibility with other assays for quantifying replication competent HIV-1 in PBMC from a large and well characterized repository of samples from HIV-infected participants on suppressive ART therapy. As a part of the additional validation of the TZA we will measure the dynamics of the size of replication-competent pool of virus in these cells in subjects who initiated therapy during the acute or chronic stages of infection in subjects from the MACS; 2) To quantify replication-competent HIV-1 in semen and gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) from aviremic subjects under ART using the TZA. Ultimately, we anticipate that further development, refinement and validation of TZA will provide a much-needed tool to quantify viral reservoir in blood and tissues that could be widely used by investigators involved in HIV-1 cure studies.',\n",
       " 'Monoclonal antibody for autoimmune disease Abstract  B cells play a major role in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis, and type I diabetes mellitus (T1D), as indicated by the efficacy of B cell?targeted therapies, e.g. rituximab, in these diseases. Unfortunately, current therapies are predicated on B-cell depletion, which is problematic from a safety standpoint. Due to consequent immunosuppression, existing standard-of-care therapies generate adverse effects, notably opportunistic infections and activation of viruses from latency, due to long-term, severe B cell depletion. Recently, an alternative approach involving the targeting of CD79, the transducer subunit of the B cell receptor (BCR) has been suggested by our group. Unlike anti-CD20 mAbs, the protective effects of CD79-targeted mAbs do not require cell depletion; rather, they act by inducing a reversible unresponsive or anergic state, and thus do not participate in immune response generation. In the murine MRL/lpr model of SLE, anti-CD79 antibodies were potently immunosuppressive and effective at decreasing inflammation and improving survival (Li, 2008). In a collagen-induced arthritis model of rheumatoid arthritis, anti-CD79 antibodies delayed the onset of arthritis and decreased arthritis scores by inducing anergy with transient, reversible B cell redistribution (Hardy, 2014). Based on these studies, Phase 1 work identified and characterized a potent humanized monoclonal anti- human CD79 antibody. The activity of the antibody does not require ADCC, complement fixation, but rather acts by induction of a transient and reversible state of polyclonal B cell anergy. During this Phase II project, we will expand preclinical studies in a transgenic mouse model expressing huCD79 and in a NOD mouse model of T1D. In addition, we will explore the molecular basis of unresponsiveness and analyze toxicity, and pharmacokinetics, as well as activity in non-human primates. We expect this second generation immunosuppressive therapeutic to be significantly safer than existing B cell-targeted antibodies for T1D and potentially other autoimmune diseases. 1 R43 AI120433-01',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly evident that rationally designed combination therapies impacting multiple targets will most likely to improve outcomes in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). However, the selective delivery of multiple regimens to the right place, at the right time, and in the correct sequence with consideration of mechanistic interactions remains a major challenge. Light-activated approaches combined with nanotechnology provide a unique opportunity to deliver multiple agents targeted at several key molecular pathways. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a light-based cytotoxic modality that can synergize with chemo and biological agents. PDT is FDA-approved for several cancers and it is in phase III trial for GBM. The underlying hypothesis is that properly timed, nanotechnology-assisted combination therapies based on interactive mechanisms that target multiple non-overlapping tumor growth/survival pathways is key to improving treatment efficacy, and allows for non-overlapping toxicities and reduced dose. This proposal leverages image-guided approaches and polymer engineering to develop a photoimmunoconjugate-nanocarrier (PICNC) that integrates an FDA-approved PDT agent (verteporfin), a clinically promising chemodrug (SN-38), and a multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKi, cediranib). All the agents are compartmentalized for appropriate release kinetics to ensure the correct sequence of action that accounts for the mechanistic synergism of the combination treatment. During the K99 phase, SN-38-loaded nanocarriers will be decorated with cetuximab-verteporfin photoimmunoconjugates (PICs) for tumor targeting and image-guided combination therapy (PDT + SN-38). It is hypothesized that SN- 38 improves tumor tissue oxygenation to favor oxygen-dependent PDT, while PDT destroys efflux pumps to increase intracellular SN-38 levels, will improve the overall outcome. To prepare for R00 transition, Dr. Huang will leverage his chemical engineering background to develop a variety of modified polymer nanoparticles loaded with a third RTKi agent, engineered to modulate the RTKi release kinetics, which will be incorporated into the PICNC. The hypothesis is that the customized RTKi release kinetics will maximize the mitigation of the compensatory RTK survival pathways elicited by PDT and SN-38 to improve outcome. During the R00 phase, Dr. Huang will establish the molecular impact and the image-guided treatment planning of PICNCs, and then evaluate the therapeutic effects of PICNCs and customized PDT schedule. A strong mentoring committee has been assembled to guide Dr. Huang's research and facilitate his transition to independence. Dr. Tayyaba Hasan (primary mentor) will train Dr. Huang in photobiology, PIC-nanocarriers, and combination mechanism. Dr. David Boas (co-mentor) is an expert in optical and spectral imaging of tissue oxygen metabolism. Additional distinguished members are: Dr. Brian Pogue, a fluorescence imaging expert; Dr. Shiladitya Sengupta, an polymer nanoparticle expert; Drs. Robert Martuza, Xandra Breakefield, and Anat Stemmer-Rachamimov are experts in clinical management, animal models and molecular biology of GBM.\",\n",

       " 'The Xpert MTB/RIF assay, an automated, integrated nucleic acid amplification diagnostic test, has been a major breakthrough in tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics. Yet, large proportions of TB suspects are placed on TB treatment based on empirical decision-making even in settings where Xpert MTB/RIF is available. Empirical TB treatment decisions can be problematic, resulting both in under-treatment and in over-treatment. A major driver of empirical TB treatment is Xpert MTB/RIF?s modest sensitivity in smear-negative pulmonary TB patients ? Xpert MTB/RIF detects only about one-half to two-thirds of such patients. A TB test with exceedingly high sensitivity and negative predictive value would substantially increase clinicians? confidence in a negative test result and thereby shift therapeutic decision making away from empiricism and towards a microbiological evidence-based approach. To maximize the individual and population level impact of rapid TB diagnostics, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay has been re-engineered to substantially increase test sensitivity, as demonstrated by preliminary data. The proposed research will establish the clinical diagnostic accuracy of the new Ultra test in adults with signs/symptoms of pulmonary TB, and will provide information about the potential impact of Ultra-based diagnostic algorithms on individual and public health. Project aims are 1) to determine the clinical diagnostic accuracy of the Ultra test for detection of M. tuberculosis in sputum; 2) to refine estimates of Ultra specificity for detection of rifampin resistance; and 3) to characterize short-term participant outcomes including initiation of treatment and to model the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of TB diagnosis using Ultra. Two hypotheses will be tested with regard to TB case detection ? first, that Ultra sensitivity is superior to that of Xpert MTB/RIF in adults with smear-negative/culture-confirmed pulmonary TB; and second, that the sensitivity of a single Ultra test is non-inferior to that of a single liquid culture in adults with pulmonary TB. To accomplish these aims, a multi-site clinical diagnostic accuracy study will be conducted in Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil. This study will incorporate a robust gold standard of multiple sputum cultures at the time of a participant?s enrollment; an observational component comprised of follow-up over two months will allow characterization of treatment initiation patterns and collection of parameter estimates for mathematical models. This proposal will extend an ongoing early phase Ultra accuracy study currently being performed by the DMID/TB-Clinical Diagnostics Research Consortium in the same settings, and thereby accrue sufficient participants to test these novel hypotheses in a step-wise technology evaluation process that is seamless and efficient. Study results are expected to form the evidence base for World Health Organization policy guidance; a finding that Ultra sensitivity is non-inferior to that of a liquid culture test could transform TB diagnostic algorithms and clinical care.',\n",
       " 'Central questions in the neurobiology of learning and memory are where and how experience modifies the brain to alter behavior. Recently we have described a physiological phenomenon in head-fixed awake mice termed stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP), in which responsiveness of primary visual cortex is markedly enhanced as a result of repeated exposure to specific visual stimuli. This robust form of plasticity is induced and expressed in the adult primary visual cortex and displays many of the features that are characteristic of perceptual learning. The primary aims of this research are to; a) to determine the behavioral significance of SRP using two novel behavioral assays; b) determine how SRP is expressed at the cellular level within visual cortex and; c) pinpoint the synapses that are modified. Beyond the relevance of our proposed research to identifying the mechanisms underlying perceptual learning and/or visual recognition memory, they will broaden our understanding of how primary sensory areas are modified by sensory experience in order to modify behavior, which remains one of the great challenges in basic neuroscience.',\n",
       " 'Gastrointestinal (GI) function is regulated by the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS contains all of the circuitry needed to regulate GI function but it does this in collaboration with information coming from visceral afferents, sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent neurons as well as being sensitive to neuromodulators released from the intestinal epithelium. A rich literature exists demonstrating the importance of these individual inputs for normal GI function, but until recently it has been difficult to investigate the connectome within the ENS or the connectivity between the ENS and its extrinsic inputs that might underlie pathological states. The first step in exploring the use of neuromodulation approaches to treating GI disease is elucidating the intrinsic and extrinsic connectome that allows the ENS to maintain gut homeostasis. To do this we propose to use electrophysiology, imaging, optogenetics, and molecular phenotyping to identify how ENS neurons communicate with each other, extrinsic sensory and autonomic neurons and the gut epithelium. This OT2 application follows successful competition of our OT1 application in response to RFA-RM-15-018 with the goal of developing a comprehensive functional map of neuroanatomy and neurobiology of the enteric neural circuits and associated extrinsic innervation. We will stimulate or monitor specific subsets of neurons based on chemical coding, electrophysiological membrane properties or synaptic components in new mouse models. The goal of generating a predictive functional and anatomical neural circuit map will be accomplished by the following specific aims: 1) Generate a dynamic anatomical map of the ENS circuitry, in genetically modified mice expressing the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6, ChR2 and/or fluorescent markers; 2) Generate a dynamic anatomical map of ENS intrinsic and extrinsic afferent circuits to determine how input from the epithelium and peripheral nervous system interfaces with the ENS in mice expressing optogenetic actuators/sensors, and 3) determine the molecular signature of mouse and human ENS neurons. Taking all anatomical and functional data together we will generate testable predictive mathematical models of ENS circuitry and its extrinsic innervation.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The burden of prostate cancer among Veterans is substantial with over 200,000 survivors and  12,000 new diagnoses annually. Most men live with rather than die from this common disease  making prostate cancer survivorship care especially important. Because of its leadership in  chronic disease care and the proportion of older men served, the Veterans Health  Administration (VHA) is well positioned to become one of the national leaders in prostate cancer  survivorship care. However, the quality of Veteran prostate cancer survivorship care is largely  unknown. In addition, there is poor consensus about whether primary care providers or cancer  specialists should have primary responsibility for ongoing cancer surveillance and management  of treatment-related side effects (e.g., incontinence, osteoporosis). Ultimately, the design and  implementation of tools to optimize prostate cancer survivorship care rests upon understanding  how responsibility for survivorship care is managed and the barriers to good survivorship care.  This research program will improve our understanding of Veteran prostate cancer survivorship  care and seek to improve it using state-of-the-art implementation science methods. This  program has three aims. Aim 1: To examine variation in 2 key quality indicators of prostate  cancer survivorship care. Using national VHA data (2005-2011), we will examine variation in  the quality of prostate cancer survivorship care for cancer surveillance and bone density testing.  Aim 2: To assess barriers and facilitators to delivering high quality prostate cancer  survivorship care. Guided by theory, we will perform focus groups and interviews with primary  care providers and prostate cancer specialists to better understand how to improve survivorship  care. Aim 3: To develop, implement and pilot a theory-based intervention to improve the  quality of prostate cancer survivorship care. We will use our findings to pilot an intervention  that addresses quality gaps in cancer surveillance and bone density testing uncovered in Aim 1,  in preparation for a randomized trial. Due to the expanding population of Veteran prostate  cancer survivors, optimizing their quality of survivorship care is of the utmost importance. Our  findings will inform models for cancer survivorship care across VHA and guide future  implementation efforts to improve the quality of cancer care.',\n",
       " 'Abstract (Project Summary) The overall goal of the proposed project is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying the relationships between a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and alcohol and other substance use outcomes in women. Women with CSA history have earlier onset of alcohol misuse and higher rates of alcohol use disorders, even after controlling for family background factors influencing both CSA exposure and problem drinking, such as family history of alcoholism. Converging evidence suggests that CSA and its consequences for brain development may constitute a distinct etiological pathway to alcoholism in women. However, neural, cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes and mechanisms underlying the link between CSA and alcohol abuse are not well understood. Existing research on neurobehavioral consequences of CSA have typically relied on small samples and insufficiently matched control groups limiting control for family-level confounding factors and causal inferences. The proposed study seeks to address these gaps in knowledge and methodological challenges by utilizing a unique resource consisting of several large, well-characterized, longitudinal samples and implementing a model-driven set of experimental paradigms to test the hypothesis that problem drinking in CSA+ women is mediated by biased affective processing and dysfunction in cognitive control, leading to dysregulated affect and, consequently, coping motives for drinking. The proposed studies are strongly grounded in the current theories of addiction and supported by preliminary findings from our laboratory. Young adult women with a history of early CSA (n=80) and propensity score-matched controls (n=120, including 40 CSA- co-twins from CSA-discordant MZ twin pairs) will participate in a laboratory session involving face-to-face interviews, behavioral and cognitive testing, and the recording of quantitative EEG and ERPs in several behavioral paradigms. The following Specific Aims will be pursued: 1) to elucidate behavioral and psychophysiological mechanisms underlying the relationship between CSA, alcohol, and other substance use outcomes in women, 2) to examine alcohol cue reactivity (ACR) in CSA+ and CSA- women and its relationship with drinking motives and problem drinking, and 3) to determine whether observed differences associated with CSA represent consequences of abuse rather than pre-existing vulnerabilities by using the cotwin control design. In summary, the proposed project is aimed at bridging important gaps in knowledge and will be one of the first well-powered and well-controlled inquiries into the neurobehavioral pathways and mechanisms underlying an important etiological pathway to alcoholism in women. Several aspects of the proposed research are particularly novel: the use of propensity score matching and discordant twin analyses to control for potential confounding variables, focus on a specific etiological pathway to alcoholism in women; and explication of neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying the link between CSA and alcohol problems.',\n",
       " \"ABSTRACT We can see things in three dimensions (3D) because the visual system reconstructs the 3D configuration of objects from their two-dimensional images projected onto the retina. Previous studies have described loss of 3D binocular vision and constructional apraxia after parietal lesions, although the neurophysiology of this effect remains poorly understood. Furthermore, many studies have characterized the neural basis of binocular disparity processing, although few have dealt with the representation of 3D object orientation and how this is maintained invariant in the world. In the proposed studies we will examine neural selectivity for 3D planar orientation in the caudal intraparietal area (CIP), visual posterior sylvian (VPS) and area V3A of macaque monkeys. We employ a multi-faceted approach, combining neural recordings, behavior, population decoding and chemical inactivation. We will directly test the role of each of these areas in slant discrimination by first recording and then manipulating neural activity while macaques perform a fine slant discrimination task. Neural firing rates will be analyzed using signal detection theory and we will quantify neuronal variability by measuring noise correlations and choice probabilities. We will also probe for causal links between neurons in these areas and slant orientation perception by employing reversible inactivation. Furthermore, it has been known that gravity plays a critical role in shaping our visual experience of the world, influencing both sensory perception and motor planning, but surprisingly little is known about where and how the brain may use a neural estimate of gravity to transform visual signals from retinal to an allocentric representation. The proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that the transformation occurs progressively, beginning with an egocentric representation in V3A (CIP's main visual input) and culminating in a primarily gravity-centered representation: V3A (egocentric) ? CIP ? VPS (mostly gravity-centered). Finally, we will test earth-vertical slant orientation perception in animals after bilateral labyrinthectomy to monitor deficits in visual orientation perception, both acutely and after recovery from peripheral vestibular lesion. We hypothesize acute deficits, but also a functional recovery as the role of proprioceptive signals increases. This research is important for understanding multisensory visual?vestibular influences on 3D vision in a 3D world.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major clinical and public health problem. AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke, embolic events, heart failure exacerbation, and all-cause mortality. Most of the evidence on the consequences of AF has focused on patients with persistent AF. However, the most common type of AF in the US is paroxysmal AF (PAF) which is often asymptomatic and unlikely to be identified except in subjects undergoing continuous cardiac monitoring. Hence, the natural history and health consequences of PAF and its progression towards persistent AF remain incompletely understood. Recent efforts focusing on understanding the role of PAF in triggering strokes and other major adverse events have been inconclusive and current evidence is insufficient to quantify the risk of stroke and other major adverse events associated with PAF episodes due to limited follow-up and sample size.  To better understand the short- and long-term effects of PAF on the risk of death and other cardiovascular events, we will assemble a unique dataset of ~238,000 patients with dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) using remote monitoring implanted from 2006-2017 and with no persistent/permanent AF at the time of implant but who are at particularly high risk for PAF. This dataset represents the largest cohort of individuals with continuous monitoring of atrial arrhythmic events and is the result of an unprecedented combination of data from the three major ICD manufacturers (Medtronic, Boston Scientific, and St. Jude Medical), which collectively have 95% of the US ICD market. Reliable automated algorithms for detecting PAF episodes of duration >30 minutes are available in all dual-chamber ICDs which record time of onset, duration and heart rates. We will link PAF episode data with patient characteristics at the time of implant from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry and with hospitalization outcomes data from the Medicare utilization files and the National Death Index with up to 12 years of follow-up (~990,000 person-years of follow-up) through well-established linking methodologies using indirect data elements. The primary endpoint will be ischemic stroke (expected number of events ~4,700) and the secondary endpoints will be myocardial infarction (~8,600 events), other embolic events (~4,500 events), hospitalization for heart failure exacerbation (~20,500 events) and all-cause mortality (~96,700 events). We hypothesize that PAF episodes increase the short-term and the long-term risk of the primary and secondary endpoints and that faster rates of progression toward persistent AF are also associated with an increased risk of outcomes. The scope and size of this study will allow us to describe the consequences and progression of PAF and to quantitatively estimate, for the first time, the short- and long-term increase in risk associated with PAF episodes. These results will have important implications for clinical risk assessment and health policy.',\n",
       " 'Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) is an attractive technique for cellular applications. It determines kinetic and molecular properties of proteins with submicron resolution and single molecule sensitivity in the living cell. Brightness is a unique FFS parameter that specifies the average fluorescence intensity of a protein complex. Because brightness is directly proportional to the number of labeled proteins in the complex, it identifies the oligomeric state of the labeled protein. This conceptual idea has been successfully applied to measure the stoichiometry and binding curve of proteins in the living cell. We seek to build on this success by proposing projects with the potential for significant impact on quantitative cell studies that continue to push the envelope of the FFS method. The formation of ternary or higher-order protein complexes are ubiquitous features of protein interactions and play an important role in the regulation of cellular processes. However, current methods are mostly limited to the detection of interactions involving two proteins inside the cell. We seek to overcome this technical bottleneck and develop an FFS approach with the capacity to detect and characterize the interactions of ternary protein systems in the living cell. Another topic of interest is the nuclear envelope (NE), which consists of a double membrane layer that separates the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. It is now being recognized that the NE integrates a number of important cell functions, which include the regulation of signal transduction pathways and mechanical force transduction between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The NE has over 60 distinct membrane proteins, whose physical and functional interactions remain largely unexplored. Characterization of these interactions will be crucial to understand the cell biology of the NE and to develop treatments for the growing range of human disorders linked to NE proteins. To facilitate such research, we propose to develop a quantitative FFS technique that explores the interaction and oligomerization of NE proteins inside the living cell. The environment of the NE poses a unique challenge for brightness measurements, which will be addressed by a novel analysis approach. We next propose to complement FFS with photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) in order to harness the strength of both techniques. While PALM determines stoichiometry and surface density of membrane proteins at low concentrations, which are often closer to physiological conditions, FFS complements these results at high surface densities, which facilitates the detection of weak interactions. We will implement combined FFS and PALM studies and perform tests on simple model systems before moving to applications. These projects are expected to open up new avenues for exploring protein-protein interactions in cells with potential applications ranging from basic research in cell biology to pharmaceutical drug screening. Advances in FFS could help fight diseases by providing detailed information about protein interactions and may lead to the identification of targets for drug development.',\n",
       " 'Project title: Pathogenic Role of EPAC1 Signaling in Retinopathy of Prematurity SUMMARY Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the leading cause of vision impair and blindness in the USA in the childhood. Laser photocoagulation is the standard-of-care for treating retinal neovascularization (NV) in ROP, and supplement cryotherapy is occasionally used in severe cases. These treatments only target pathological neovascularization (NV) and have many limitations. There is great need for new strategies and therapies to target other aspects of the disease, including retinal neuronal injury, and promote vascular repair in addition to the control of NV. This study is to determine the role of Epac1 in neuronal injury, pathological NV and physiological vascular repair, and determine the therapeutic effect of Epac inhibitors. Our central hypothesis is that Epac1 activation plays a key causal role in retinal neuronal injury, impairing vascular repair and promoting retinal pathological neovascularization during oxygen-induced retinopathy. This application will, for the first time, use Epac1 global KO mice, Epac1 conditional KO mice and novel Epac inhibitor to investigate the cAMP/Epac1 pathway in retinal neuronal injury, NV and vascular repair. It will address specific contributions of neuronal vs. endothelial Epac1 in these processes, and investigate potential mechanisms of Epac1-induced retinal neuronal and vascular alternations. The research is expected to significantly advance the mechanistic understanding of retinal neurovascular pathologic changes and should facilitate the development of novel strategies to prevent NV, protect retinal neurons and improves vascular repair in ROP.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION: With 35 million HIV-infected individuals worldwide, the challenge to improve health in these individuals is vast. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV replication, which prevents AIDS and reduces overall mortality; however ART does not fully restore health. Indeed, despite sustained suppression of viremia, individuals cannot discontinue ART as residual HIV persists, and virus rebound is inevitable if ART is discontinued. This residual HIV reservoir is associated with ongoing inflammation. Cannabis is a widely used drug in the United States, and derivatives of cannabis such as cannabinoids are commonly used in treatment of nausea and cachexia in severe conditions such as cancer. Several studies have demonstrated that cannabinoids have the propensity to alter immune responses and decrease inflammation in vivo. We hypothesize that cannabis use in the context of ART-treated HIV infection may decrease inflammation and the persistent HIV reservoir. Here, we provocatively propose to test this hypothesis in humans by measuring inflammation, immunity, and the HIV reservoir from blood and gastrointestinal (GI) tissues from HIV-infected individuals who report using cannabis daily compared to those reporting no drug use. Furthermore, we will assess mechanisms of cannabinoid anti- inflammatory activity ex-vivo using cannabinoid receptor agonists in co-cultures. In addition, we will exploit the non-human primate model of SIV infection to test causality of this unconventional idea, by treating ART- treated, SIV infected macaques with cannabinoids to assess the effects on SIV reservoir and inflammation. With an outstanding team of researchers, we will assess the following: (i.) Global systems biology, including species-specific transcriptional analysis and bioinformatics; (ii.) The HIV and SIV reservoir using novel assays to measure integrated, total and inducible virus; (iii.) Inflammation and immunophenotype of immune cell subsets; (iv.) Systemic microbial translocation and GI tract barrier integrity; and (v.) drug levels and kinetics in blood and GI tract. We believe these proposed studies will be integral to better understanding facets associated with the HIV reservoir and may provide a novel therapeutic approach, exploiting a drug of abuse, towards development of an HIV cure.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The heart is the first organ to develop, a process that involves multiple cell fate decisions and morphological processes. Key among these is the orientation of specific morphological events such as trabeculation and septation toward the heart lumen. Failure of these processes can result in congenital heart disease, a major cause of mortality and morbidity. The objective of this proposal is to identify the mechanism whereby atypical Protein Kinase C Iota (Prkci) and the downstream PAR polarity machinery direct myocardial polarization at the single cell and whole organ levels. The central hypothesis is that directional cues from the endocardium and cardiac jelly direct Prkci and the Par complex to orient the spindle apparatus and the cell division plane of luminal myocardial toward the heart lumen and propel trabecular formation. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratory and is tested with three specific aims: 1) determine how Prkci directs cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation during ventricular trabeculation; 2) define the molecular mechanism through which Prkci controls the Par complex and the spindle machinery to regulate polarized cell division in luminal myocardial cells; and 3) define the non-cell autonomous inductive signaling cues that direct myocardial polarization. Under the first aim, single cell clonal analysis is performed to determine how Prkci directs oriented cell division. Highly innovative cell labeling and genome editing techniques are coupled with cutting-edge spectral confocal microscopy to define the role of Prkci-dependent polarized cell division in the initiation of trabeculation. In the second aim, the applicant determines how Prkci controls the downstream Par machinery and explores the potential of this pathway to direct polarized cell division in human stem cell derived myocytes. In the third aim, the applicant identifies the upstream inductive cues that feed into Prkci and its interacting partners and adapts the knowledge gained from developmental biology to stem cell biology. The rationale for these studies is that they are the first to address how the highly conserved PAR complex orients the mitotic spindle and axis of cell division to control myocardial alignment during in vivo cardiogenesis and in vitro cellular differentiation. The advent of stem cell based approaches to regenerative cardiology and the necessity of ensuring the proper cellular alignment of transplanted cells or constructs make this research highly significant. Thus, the overall impact of this project is to provide a mechanistic understanding of how the highly conserved Par machinery directs polarized cell division to control normal cardiac organogenesis. This study provides a fundamental understanding of a key morphological event in cardiac development that can be applied to regenerative cardiovascular medicine where it is necessary to expand the number of functional CMs and promote their alignment and cellular integration with the native myocardium.\",\n",
       " \"Neurodegenerative diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly Veterans. No cures exist for neurodegenerative diseases, because the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms that cause neurons to die with age are poorly understood. Our long-term objective is to decipher the mechanisms required for neuronal function and survival and to identify how dysfunction of these mechanisms contribute to progressive age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Comprehensive genome wide studies of patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy recently identified the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2? kinase 3/PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (EIF2AK3/PERK) gene as a genetic risk factor for neurodegeneration. EIF2AK3/PERK encodes an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein kinase that is essential for cells to survive pathologic and environmental conditions that cause misfolded proteins and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In response to misfolded proteins and ER stress, EIF2AK3/PERK dimerizes to activate its kinase domain. Multiple EIF2AK3/PERK haplotypes with various amino acid substitutions are found in the human population. The function of EIF2AK3/PERK in neurons and the mechanism by which some EIF2AK3/PERK haplotypes cause neurodegeneration are unknown. We recently discovered that EIF2AK3/PERK haplotypes associated with neurodegeneration have significantly reduced kinase activity compared to protective haplotypes. We also found that neurons generated from skin fibroblasts of patients with high-risk EIF2AK3/PERK haplotypes showed impaired EIF2AK3/PERK signaling in response to ER stress. Last, we found that EIF2AK3/PERK signaling is robustly activated in a mouse model of tauopathy neurodegeneration. Based on these preliminary findings, our central hypothesis is that EIF2AK3/PERK is activated during neurodegeneration to preserve neuronal cell function and viability, and loss of EIF2AK3/PERK function leads to increased protein misfolding and increased ER stress that ultimately cause neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration. We propose cellular, molecular, and genetic experiments to test this hypothesis and determine the function of EIF2AK3/PERK in neurodegeneration. First, we will characterize the biochemical and enzymatic activities of high-risk and low-risk human EIF2AK3/PERK associated with neurodegeneration. We will perform biochemical studies of recombinant EIF2AK3/PERK proteins to analyze the functional consequences of amino acid alterations associated with human haplotype variants. Second, we will test if modulation of EIF2AK3/PERK signaling prevents disease in the PS19 transgenic mouse model of neurodegeneration. We will cross PS19 mice with genetically modified mice that increase EIF2AK3/PERK signaling. We will treat PS19 mice with orally available drugs that increase or inhibit EIF2AK3/PERK signaling. We will perform molecular, histologic, and behavioral studies to examine how EIF2AK3/PERK modulation affects neuropathology and neurodegeneration in this animal model. Last, we will evaluate EIF2AK3/PERK signal transduction in stem cell-derived neurons generated from patients with high-risk and low-risk EIF2AK3/PERK haplotypes. We will determine how genetic variants of EIF2AK3/PERK affect neuronal tau protein folding and neuronal susceptibility to ER stress-induced cell death. In parallel, we will test novel pharmacologic modulators of EIF2AK3/PERK signaling to see if we can prevent neuronal cell death when PERK is artificially activated. In summary, EIF2AK3/PERK variants are important genetic risk factors for developing neurodegeneration but their function and mechanisms are unknown and treatments are lacking. These studies are significant because they will reveal the role of EIF2AK3/PERK in neurons and why EIF2AK3/PERK variants in people can increase risk for developing neurodegeneration. Our studies will positively benefit the mission of the VA by identifying potential treatments to prevent neurodegeneration in Veterans and patients carrying the high-risk alleles.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Candidate: From my residency training in Pediatrics, through fellowship in Allergy and Immunology, to my current position as an Assistant Professor at the University of Utah, I worked towards the overarching goal of improving diagnosis and treatment by understanding the genetic and pathophysiologic basis of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). I am committed to an academic career as a physician scientist, elucidating disease mechanisms and translating discoveries in genetics to improving the care of patients with PIDs. I have demonstrated this commitment based on my development of outstanding mentorship at my institution, and have generated two first-authored, high-impact research articles involving the genetic investigation of a form of common variable immunodeficiency, and a population genetic analysis of RAG mutations associated with PIDs. Further, I have developed collaborations with key investigators within and outside of the University to maximize both relevant patient samples and efforts involving functional and genetic analyses of PIDs. Institutional Environment: I work in the laboratories of both Lynn Jorde, PhD, (Department of Human Genetics) and Guy Zimmerman, MD, (Molecular Medicine Program) and both laboratories are situated within the Eccles Institute of Human Genetics building located on the University of Utah Health Sciences campus. The University of Utah is an institution rich with resources to support physician scientists and includes the Health Sciences Center, which includes both a network of patient clinics and an adult hospital at the School of Medicine; a pediatric tertiary hospital; and support for researchers including vast core facility resources and the University of Utah Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS). My research environment is ideal for support of my research project and training aims. The Department of Pediatrics has demonstrated a commitment to support my career goals by providing intensive mentoring and training through the departmental Pediatric Clinical and Translational (PCAT) Research Scholars Program as well as being selected as a scholar in the K12 Child Health Research Career Development Award Program. Career Development and Training: My short-term career objective is to gain an understanding of the genetic and molecular pathogenesis of CVID caused by defects in the noncanonical NF-?B pathway. My longterm career objective includes development into an R01-funded, independent principle investigator who is able    to lead multiple projects in translational investigations of CVID and other PIDs. I crafted my career    development activities together with an outstanding mentorship team with two primary co-mentors and three advisors to build on my past research experiences and to address new skill development. My scientific training includes development of laboratory bench skills in functional immune assays utilizing human cells, development of my technical skills and understanding of bioinformatics in next-generation sequencing modalities, as well as development of clinical diagnostics for improved immunophenotyping of PID patients. My professional development and training includes continued development of my leadership skills to improve my ability to manage an independent laboratory, as well as continued development of collaborative relationships in the national and international PID community. The training plan includes regular meetings with my co-mentors, didactic courses, seminars, and national/international meetings. Project Description: We recently identified NFKB2 (NF-?B2), and its signaling pathway, the noncanonical NF-?B pathway, as the etiology of a form of CVID. Our preliminary data have demonstrated that the NFKB2 mutations in our CVID cohort result in reduced NF-?B2/p52 nuclear translocation. The resultant phenotype includes early age-onset of panhypogammaglobulinemia, autoimmune features and adrenal insufficiency. Little is known about the direct downstream signaling and transcriptional effects of NF-?B2 in humans, and why mutations in NFKB2 may result in the specific CVID phenotype. We aim to delineate the effects of NFKB2 mutations at the transcriptional, molecular, and cellular levels to better understand the contribution of the noncanonical NF-?B pathway in maintaining humoral immunity. First, we will perform functional B cell assays to identify defects contributing to poor antibody production. Second, we will perform RNA-Seq to determine differences in gene expression caused by mutant NFKB2, in order to identify the targets that have protein level changes. Using RNA-Seq, we will identify the major signaling pathways regulated by NF-?B2 and confirm alterations at the protein level. Finally, we will perform exome sequencing followed by state-of-the-art bioinformatic analysis to investigate pathways regulated by NF-?B2, identify and phenotype additional CVID patients with noncanonical NF-?B defects, and discover new disease-causing variants. The research proposed here will allow me to combine my clinical skills with thorough training in cutting-edge genomic and molecular analysis. It will position me at the forefront of the genetic revolution.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Florida, College of Medicine has a long tradition and record of accomplishments in the training of medical students for careers in academic medicine and research. This application is a resubmission of a competitive renewal of a T35 Short-Term Training for Medical Students in Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Research that was first awarded to the School in 1981 and now in its 30th year. The purpose of the training grant is to provide intensive, short-term (2.5 month) training in research for twenty 1st year medical students (MS1) whose projects focus on heart, lung, and blood topics that will be conducted under the guidance of faculty mentors who have a proven record of outstanding research and training of pre-doctoral and post- doctoral medical and graduate students. Beginning in the Fall of 2013 with the entering Class of 2017, the core medical curriculum will include the Discovery Pathways Program (DPP), which will extend across all four years of medical training. All 135 medical students in the Class of 2017 will select a research and discovery (R&D) project and faculty mentor from the hundreds of projects grouped within one of the six Discovery Tracks, and they will initiate their R&D projects in the 10-weeks of the summer following completion of the Spring semester courses. This broad range of potential research topics is made possible because of the diversity of the research areas of the more than 800 faculty members of the College of Medicine, including the 42 T35 Program Faculty. The participation of all MS1s in the DPP will ensure an even larger pool of quality R&D projects from which the 20 MS1s will be selected to receive the T35 NHLBI scholarships (2 of the 20 scholarships will be funded by the College of Medicine). The DPP curriculum during the first year includes instruction in fundamentals of R&D, including tools for literature surveys, generating hypothesis driven questions, biomedical statistics, scientific report writing, interpreting evidenced based medicine guidelines, and responsible conduct of research. The T35 students will receive additional enrichment in R&D training through weekly T35 student group meetings, peer presentations of research projects, extensive training in preparing abstracts, posters and grant proposals, attending special lectures and participating in activities with key personnel from the Clinical and Translational Science Institute. During the 2nd and 3rd years of medical classes, the T35 students and their classmates will continue meeting with their faculty mentor and advancing their research projects through various mechanisms including elective courses, seminars, research group meetings. During the 4th year, T35 students and their classmates will take two 4-week elective courses to complete their R&D projects and they will generate a capstone scholarly work product such as a research journal paper. Long term follow up of T35 trainees indicates the research experience gained by the T35 trainees has substantial impact on their research productivity and careers, and the DPP and the enriched T35 program will enhance that outcome.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) infection leads to a spectrum of neurological and cognitive abnormalities, known collectively as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HAND remains prevalent, particularly in its milder forms, despite effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The pathogenesis of HAND is involves HIV-infected perivascular macrophages and microglia, whose activation leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other soluble factors toxic to neurons. One factor that may be involved in macrophage-mediated HIV neurotoxicity is cathepsin B, a cysteine protease. We recently demonstrated that monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) secreted, cathepsin B has increased neurotoxic activity in vitro. In studies of our Hispanic women cohort, we observed increased expression of both cathepsin B and cystatin B in monocytes of women with HAD on cART with no comorbid conditions. Studies are needed to determine the role of monocyte cathepsin B, cystatins B and C, as potential biomarkers for HAND by flow cytometry. A pilot study of limited samples post-mortem brain tissue indicated that cathepsin B is also upregulated in the CNS of patients with HAND [1]. New preliminary studies of MDM secreted interactome demonstrate that cathepsin B interacts with MMP-9 in uninfected cells but this interaction disappears in HIV infection and develops a new interaction with serum amyloid P component (SAPC), related to amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies in the literature also suggest that cathepsin B might be involved in amyloid-beta (AÂ¿)- related inflammatory response, which results in neuronal death. This new role of cathepsin B in HIV infection deserves further studies. Our long-term goal is to determine the potential of the cathepsin B system as a diagnostic tool and therapeutic target for HAND and the mechanisms whereby cathepsin B dysregulation causes neuronal cell dysfunction and death. Our central hypothesis is that increased secretion of monocyte-derived cathepsin B after HIV infection causes neuronal dysfunction and death, and contributes to the pathogenesis of HAND. The proposed research is conceptually innovative because the role of the cathepsin B as a potential early blood biomarker of HAND has not been explored. Understanding how dysregulation of the cathepsin B interacting proteins in the HIV-infected MDM secretome contributes to neurotoxicity using primary human neurons could elucidate novel targets for therapy. The specific aims are: 1) Create a longitudinal expression profile of cathepsin B and cystatins B and C in CD14+ monocytes from HAND patients. 2) Characterize of the interactome of MDM-secreted cathepsin B and its involvement in HIV-induced neuronal death; 3) Determine the translational significance of cathepsin B interactome in human post-mortem brain tissue. The proposed studies will significantly advance the HIV field by providing new clinical diagnostic tools, new pathways, and possible complementary therapies against HAND.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY: Vertebrate photoreceptors are an elegant example of form being finely tuned to support function. These primary sensory neurons are linearly organized into a series of morphologically and functionally distinct compartments. All of the compartments contribute in different ways to the maintenance and signaling activity of this neuron. For instance, photons are captured in the outer segment, the synapse communicates that event to downstream neurons, and the inner segment, typically thought of as the housekeeping compartment, houses the ion channels, pumps, and transporters needed to set and maintain the circulating current that is ultimately used to communicate the presence or absence of light. The polarized trafficking of select ion channels to the different photoreceptor compartments is well recognized as essential for the health and function of this cell. Yet, the mechanisms controlling the subcellular trafficking and localization of ion channels in this cell or for that matter, most others, is poorly understood at best. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms that control polarized protein trafficking in photoreceptors. In this proposal we are building on the knowledge we gained in our earlier studies of HCN1, a hyperpolarization activated channel that filters light responses and is essential for vision in bright light. Aim 1 probes how the assembly status and permissiveness of HCN1 to leave the ER is coordinated. This aim also tests if the mechanisms controlling HCN1 processing are used to regulate Kv2.1/Kv8.2, a related ion channel also found within the inner segment that when absent results in aberrant signaling and cone dystrophy. Aim 2 probes the function and mechanism of a second trafficking signal within HCN1 that we propose is required, at least in part, to recruit the protein coat needed for the generation of HCN1-bearing transport vesicles. A suite of genetic, biochemical, imaging, and physiological tools are used. Altogether, this work will reveal fundamental mechanisms used in the polarized trafficking of photoreceptor proteins, shed light on the contributions made by the early secretory pathway to the regulation of ion channels, and is anticipated to transform current views of the fundamental organization of photoreceptors in health and disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How the sizes of the mitotic spindle and interphase nucleus are regulated within a cell remains largely unknown. This gap in knowledge prevents us from understanding the functional significance of organelle size control, particularly in the context of various cancers in which the scaling relationship between organelle and cell size has gone awry. Our long-term goal is to identify mechanisms of organelle size regulation in order to better understand how organelle size and morphology impact cell function. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular basis of organelle size control. Specifically, we will address the question of how physical constraints imposed by cell-size impact the size, shape, and function of both the mitotic spindle and interphase nucleus. Our central hypothesis is that scaling of nuclear and spindle size with cell size is mediated through a limiting component mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we have developed an innovative experimental platform that utilizes microfluidic-based technology to encapsulate cell-free extracts, allowing us to address previously intractable questions regarding organelle scaling. The rationale for completion of this research is to provide information that can be used to develop more accurate and predictive models of organelle assembly and function, which in turn may lead to new strategies for treatment of cancers and other conditions linked to improper nuclear and spindle function. Aim 1: To determine how cytoplasmic volume regulates nuclear scaling. In this aim we will utilize microfluidics and Xenopus extracts to assemble nuclei in cytoplasmic droplets of defined size, shape, and composition to determine whether changes in cytoplasmic volume are sufficient to account for in vivo nuclear scaling. Aim 2: To identify molecular effectors of mitoti spindle and interphase nuclear scaling using microfluidic encapsulation. In this aim, we will employ microfluidic emulsion/droplet-generating devices to characterize the molecular mechanisms of the scaling relationship between cytoplasmic volume and spindle/nuclear size. Using an unbiased biochemical screen in combination with candidate molecule approaches, we expect to identify components, i.e. scaling factors, whose relative amounts determine spindle/nuclear size. Aim 3: To develop microfluidic droplet manipulation techniques to enable dynamic control over cytoplasm volume and content in four dimensions (geometry and time). This aim will develop microfluidic techniques by which droplet volume or composition may be changed at specified time points to induce and observe dynamic changes in organelle size. Completion of the work proposed in these aims is expected to (i) produce a fundamental advance in our basic understanding of the mechanisms that control the size of the mitotic spindle and nucleus and (ii) demonstrate the tremendous utility and potential of combining microfluidics with an already powerful biological model system, cell-free extracts derived from Xenopus eggs and embryos. This is significant because it will fundamentally advance our knowledge of how the size of the mitotic spindle and nucleus are regulated, providing targets for new therapeutic approaches.',\n",

       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Younger potential unrelated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donors aged 18-30 are both the most clinically desirable and least available to donate after having preliminarily matched a patient in need of an HSC transplant. The ultimate goal of the proposed investigation is to improve availability of this younger donor group. The proposed study is focused on individuals aged 18-30 and will (a) identify differences between this group and older HSC registry members, (b) identify factors in younger registry members that are associated with opting out of the registry after having preliminarily matched a patient, and (c) generate and evaluate the acceptability and desirability of intervention strategies to improve younger donor availability. Within group comparisons by sex and race/ethnicity and comparison of younger new recruits to a matched sample of older registry members aged 35-44 will provide nuanced information that will allow us to tailor our potential intervention strategies. Our partner for the investigation is the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) which manages the largest registry of unrelated HSC donors in the world (> 11 million) and with whom we have an established history of collaboration. This investigation is important because (a) HSC transplantation is now a preferred treatment for life-threatening diseases of the blood, (b) increasing numbers of patients must seek HSCs from unrelated donors, (c) younger donors are the most clinically desirable group of donors, and (d) younger donors have the highest rates of unavailability when asked to donate. Innovative aspects of this research program include that (a) this will be the first systematic investigation focused on better understanding a younger group of potential donors who are both clinically desirable and less available, (b) we include variables such as community engagement, media and technology use, impulsivity, and parental influence which have not been previously included in this type of research but may be increasingly important to donation-related decisions among younger potential donors (c) the differential association of these characteristics with age, sex, race/ethnicity, and donation decisions have not been examined, and (d) this will be the first investigation to lead to the systematic development of intervention strategies to improve availability of younger HSC donors. Study aims are to (a) use web-based surveys to quantitatively describe younger newly recruited donors on five key classes of variables and to examine differences within this cohort by sex and race/ethnicity and between this cohort and an older cohort of newly recruited donors (n=1,248), (b) use web-based surveys to quantitatively compare younger registry members who continue toward donation after matching a patient with those who opt-out of the registry (n=1,440), and (c) to generate and qualitatively evaluate potential intervention strategies to improve younger donor availability. The NMDP strongly supports this investigation and is committed to using study findings to improve recruitment and management strategies for this group of highly valuable younger registry members.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Ionizing Radiation kills cancer cells by generating DNA damage. Resistance to Ionizing Radiation is generally determined by DNA repair mechanisms that can repair radiation-induced DNA damage. The most toxic effect of radiation is represented by the formation of double stranded DNA breaks. These breaks can be repaired by Homologous Recombination, and Non-Homologous End Joining DNA repair mechanisms. Inhibition of these mechanisms results in increased radiosensitivity since repair of radiation-induced double strand breaks is blocked. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms of double strand break repair is essential for designing novel radiosensitization therapies.  We have recently uncovered a novel mechanism that regulates radioresistance, centered on the protein PARP14. PARP14 is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, which unlike its well-known cousin PARP1 is unable to catalyze poly-ADP-ribose chain formation but can only transfer a single molecule of ADP-ribose to substrates. Mono-ADP-ribosylation is a still mysterious post-translational modification, and its functions in the cell are poorly characterized. Or preliminary results presented here show that PARP14 promotes repair of double strand breaks by activating Homologous Recombination DNA repair. Moreover, our preliminary results presented here indicate a mechanism for this activation: PARP14 mono-ADP-ribosylates the recombination factor RAD51 to promote RAD51 removal from D-loops thus allowing D-loop extension past the break and complete the recombination reaction. Thus, our work shows that PARP14 inhibition results in radiosensitivity by downregulating Homologous Recombination-dependent repair of radiation-induced double strand DNA breaks.  In this proposal, we test the hypothesis that PARP14 promotes the repair of radiation-induced double strand DNA breaks by Homologous Recombination, through RAD51 mono-ADP-ribosylation. We will employ a comprehensive, integrative approach to study: 1) the impact of PARP14 on the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage by Homologous Recombination and other DNA repair mechanisms, and 2) the role of RAD51 mono- ADP-ribosylation by PARP14 in repair of radiation-induced double strand breaks.  Our study is highly innovative since it addresses a novel, previously unrecognized function of mono- ADP-ribosylation in radioresistance. Our work will unravel how mono-ADP-ribosylation by PARP14 promotes radiation resistance, and describe novel radiosensitization approaches, based on PARP14 inhibition.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Aging is universal and underlies chronic disease as well as tissue and cellular deterioration. The female reproductive system is the first to age in humans, with functional loss occurring decades prior to other organs. Reproductive aging is associated with both a decline in the number of eggs within the ovary and a decrease in their quality, which together, contribute to increased incidences of miscarriages, infertility, and birth defects. Our long-term objective is to attenuate the negative consequences of female reproductive aging, which are becoming more prevalent as women globally are delaying childbearing. Reproductive transitions, such as reproductive aging, is a priority of the Fertility and Infertility branch of the National Institutes of Health, and thus our work is tightly aligned with the mission of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Although considerable research has focused on age-associated changes in the egg, correspondingly less is known about how the ovarian stroma, the microenvironment in which the egg develops, changes with age and influences egg quality. A key stromal molecule found in the ovaries is hyaluronan. Hyaluronan is synthesized and fragmented in inflamed tissues and provides signals that exacerbate inflammation and drive fibrosis in several organs. Changes in hyaluronan are also implicated in aging tissues. Here, we will test the overarching hypothesis that ovarian hyaluronan levels decrease with age along with a corresponding increase in fragmentation of existing HA into a population of small molecules central to the pathogenesis of ovarian fibrosis and inflammation, which impacts egg quality. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. First, we will examine how hyaluronan content, fragmentation, and function change in the ovary with advanced reproductive age. These studies will be performed using reproductively young and reproductively old mice and will include analysis of ovarian biomechanical properties and the impact of hyaluronan fragmentation on ovarian follicle development. Second, we will investigate the extent to which perturbation of hyaluronan expression in vivo induces ovarian stromal inflammation and fibrosis. To accomplish this goal, we will evaluate indices of inflammation and fibrosis in mice genetically or pharmacologically deficient in hyaluronan and correlate this with fertility. Third, we will determine how human ovarian and follicular fluid hyaluronan levels and fragmentation profiles change with age using human material provided by two established research repositories at Northwestern University. We will investigate the clinical relevance of our findings by correlating hyaluronan levels and fragmentation profiles with reproductive aging markers and pregnancy outcomes after assisted reproductive technologies. The premise that the ovarian stroma contributes to reproductive aging represents a novel research frontier. Completion of the studies outlined in this proposal may reveal novel hyaluronan-related therapeutic targets or points of intervention aimed at improving fertility.',\n",
       " 'Abstract  Understanding complex comorbid conditions of intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) is an NICHD priority. Severe problem behavior (e.g., self-injurious behavior, aggression) of children with IDD is prevalent, potentially dangerous, and negatively impacts social integration and quality of life. Function-based differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) interventions reduce such behavior effectively, but treatment relapse often occurs when a caregiver does not deliver reinforcement for the alternative behavior. Such relapse is known as resurgence. The efficacy of DRA interventions in reducing severe problem behavior has long been theorized to be related to the same basic processes that govern choice between concurrently available sources of reinforcement. However, quantitative theories of such choice behavior (e.g., the matching law) have not previously been applicable to resurgence following DRA because they could not account for situations in which one or both behaviors no longer produced reinforcement. This project represents a collaboration between a basic scientist/theorist and clinical scientists with expertise in DRA treatments to evaluate and translate the predictions of a novel choice-based theory of resurgence. This innovative theory is built from two fundamental and well-established principles of reinforcement: (a) individuals allocate proportionally more responding to responses that produce proportionally more reinforcement (i.e., the matching law); and (b) the value of reinforcement decreases hyperbolically as it recedes further into the past. By combining these two principles into a mathematical model, the theory accounts for resurgence in situations in which the only existing quantitative theory of resurgence (behavioral momentum theory) has failed. The choice-based theory generates novel predictions about the precise conditions under which resurgence might be expected to occur and how treatments might be altered to reduce resurgence (e.g., extending treatment duration, dynamically adjusting schedule thinning). This project empirically examines these and other novel predictions about variables of high potential clinical relevance, but for which clear data are lacking (e.g., effects of different response efforts for the target and alternative responses) and directly translates insights from the theory and basic research with animals in order to improve treatment of problem behavior in the clinic and reduce treatment relapse. Our overarching hypothesis is that DRA interventions informed by this novel theory will be less susceptible to resurgence of problem behavior: (a) during periods when reinforcers are unavailable; (b) when reinforcer availability diminishes during reinforcement schedule thinning; and (c) when other response or reinforcement parameters change, such as increases in response effort. Thus, this project seeks to fill existing gaps in basic/theoretical knowledge about resurgence and represents a rare close collaboration between basic and clinical scientists to better align basic research and clinical practice.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary The coronary vasculature plays essential roles in maintaining a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients to the heart. Coronary heart disease is a major cause of myocardial infarction and heart failure, which continues to be the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Despite its importance, the mechanisms that regulate coronary vascularization of the myocardium remain a major gap in our knowledge. We observed that during zebrafish heart development, coronary vessels form a close association with a specific subpopulation of cortical cardiomyocytes marked by the transcription factor Gata4. gata4+ cardiomyocytes follow the tracks of coronary endothelial cells when they emerge onto the surface of the juvenile zebrafish hearts. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest that expression of the Cxcl12b chemokine, a critical angiogenic factor during zebrafish coronary vessel development, is increased in expanding gata4+ cardiomyocytes. Moreover, gata4+ cardiomyocytes fail to associate with coronary vessels in hearts lacking Cxcr4a, the receptor for Cxcl12b. Importantly, adult cxcr4a mutant zebrafish fail to regenerate after heart injury. We hypothesize that heart development occurs in two phases that are regulated by temporally distinct mechanisms: newly formed coronary endothelial cells provide instructive cues, such as paracrine factors, during the emerging phase to guide gata4+ cardiomyocytes when they emerge, while during the expanding phase, cxcl12b expression increases in gata4+ cardiomyocytes to attract coronary vessels that are essential for their morphogenesis/development and regeneration. We propose to 1) To determine how new coronary vessels guide gata4+ cardiomyocytes to populate the heart ventricle by analyzing differentially expressed candidate genes identified from RNAseq encoding secreted molecules (e.g. cxcr4, erbb4) using CRISPR mutant fish lines and a novel explant culture system; 2) To determine how coronary vessels affect morphogenesis and the regenerative capacity of gata4+ cardiomyocytes during myocardial expansion using multicolor clonal analysis and by manipulating Cxcl12-Cxcr4 chemokine signaling. We will further determine how cxcl12b expression is regulated by hypoxia and Gata4. Our proposed study will reveal potential developmental causes of coronary heart diseases. Furthermore, elucidation of the mechanisms underlying myocardial vascularization in zebrafish will shed light on potential therapeutic approaches for humans.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY. TP53 is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancer. However, about half of cancers retain a wild type version of the p53 protein, which is commonly attenuated by other mechanisms, such as overexpression of the repressor MDM2. The presence of wild type p53 opens a window of opportunity for therapeutic reactivation of this transcription factor. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that modify the p53 network in a cell type-specific manner, affecting cell fate choice and tumor suppression downstream of p53 reactivation. The ultimate goal is to enable effective p53-based targeted therapies. Using a comprehensive multi-omics experimental and analytical pipeline we identified three major regulatory mechanisms affecting p53 signaling in a cell type-specific fashion: chromatin architecture at target loci, secondary ?amplifying? transcription factors, and cell type-specific translational regulators. We will investigate each mechanism in detail by developing the following Specific Aims: 1. To define the impact of cellular transformation on the direct p53 program. We discovered that cell type-specific variations in the direct p53 transcriptional program are associated with distinct patterns of chromatin architecture, including differences in DNA methylation. We will now test the hypothesis that the direct p53 program is attenuated during tumor evolution via chromatin-based mechanisms that restrict the number of available direct p53 targets. We will do this by applying our multi-omics pipeline to study the direct p53 program in intestinal organoids derived from normal epithelium and colorectal carcinoma explants. 2. To define the role of secondary transcription factors in the p53 response. We identified two novel direct p53 target genes, the transcription factors ETV7 and POU2F2, which are predicted to elicit the indirect transcriptional program in cells where p53 has an intact tumor suppressive activity. We will define the role of ETV7 and POU2F2 in the observed amplification of p53 effects on the global transcriptome, as well as their contribution to p53-dependent cellular responses in vitro, and tumor suppressive activity in xenograft models. 3. To identify translational regulators controlling the cellular response to p53 activation. Translation of hundreds of mRNAs is activated or repressed downstream of p53 in a cell type-specific manner. We identified 3?UTR motifs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that are predicted to mediate cell type-specific translational control. We will continue to identify and characterize functional RNA motifs and interacting RBPs acting in different contexts, and define their contribution to p53-dependent cellular responses in vitro and to the ability of p53 to induce tumor regression in xenograft models. Upon completion, this proposal will significantly advance our understanding of regulatory mechanisms within the p53 network, and contribute to the future design of improved p53-based therapeutic strategies.',\n",
       " \"ABSTRACT Although significant progress has been made in neonatal intensive care units, preterm infants continue to suffer from significant morbidities and comorbidities such as hypoxia-ischemia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and white matter injury/periventricular leukomalacia. For example, 65-85% of extreme preterm infants (? 28 weeks of gestational age) have patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) at first week of life, which leads to shunting of blood between the systemic and the pulmonary circulations. Because of many complications associated with PDA, the majority of extreme preterm infants receive medical or surgical therapy in an attempt to close the PDA. However, PDA and associated treatment procedures may cause large perturbations in cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism, thus impacting neonatal brain health. Currently, there is no clinically accepted quantitative monitor for continuous bedside assessment of neonatal brain health. We propose to develop and test a near-infrared diffuse speckle contrast flow-oximeter (DSCFO), which will enable simultaneous quantification of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood oxygen saturation (StO2), and cerebral metabolic rate of tissue oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in infants' brains. The DSCFO uses two small laser diodes at different wavelengths (690 nm and 830 nm) and a tiny bare complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor chip with no lenses to rapidly quantify spatial diffuse speckle fluctuations resulting from moving red blood cells for CBF measurements in relatively deep tissues (up to 8 mm). Alternative measurements of light intensity changes at the two wavelengths will enable quantification of StO2 variations. Knowing CBF and StO2 together will allow for the derivation of CMRO2. Compared to conventional near-infrared diffuse optical technologies, DSCFO is an innovative design with significantly lower cost (<$2500), a faster sampling rate (milliseconds), more detection channels on the high- resolution CMOS pixel array, and a smaller probe (25 mm x 15 mm), which is particularly applicable to cerebral monitoring in the small heads of newborn infants. In Specific Aim 1, the proposed DSCFO device will be constructed and calibrated in head-simulating tissue phantoms and adults' forearms against other established standards. In Specific Aim 2, the calibrated DSCFO device will be further examined in clinic to measure CBF, StO2, and CMRO2 in preterm infants with PDA undergoing indomethacin treatment. We hypothesize that neonatal cerebral hemodynamics/metabolism altered by the PDA and treatment can be detected by the DSCFO, which should reasonably correlate with other physiological measures and clinical outcomes. The measurement of multiple cerebral hemodynamic/metabolic variables together (i.e., CBF, StO2, and CMRO2) is expected to provide better assessment of neonatal brain health than a single parameter alone, which may help optimize patient care and reduce adverse cerebral impacts. Furthermore, the DSCFO has the potential to be used for cerebral diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of many other diseases in infants (e.g., hypoxic/ischemic injury, shock/hypotension, intermittent hypoxemia).\",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT This K08 Mentored Career Development Award proposal describes a 4 year training program for the candidate, a neurosurgeon-scientist whose long term goal is to become an independent investigator in the field of primary malignant brain tumors, with a particular focus on the relevance of microRNA-mediated interference with GBM biology and survival response to conventional therapies. The basic science expertise earned by the candidate during his graduate studies while a resident in neurosurgery, put him in the ideal position to carry over this research. Previously, the candidate has shown that miR-128, a microRNA preferentially expressed in neurons, has an antitumor effect by targeting multiple GBM proteins involved with stem cell maintenance, as well as resistance to radiation therapy. He now hypothesizes that there are other microRNAs whose abnormal expression in GBM parallels that of miR-128, and thus that multiple microRNAs could work in functional clusters to effectively reprogram GBM cells into neuron-like cells by acting on a multiplicity of proteins with an epigenetic role. He also proposes that this can be harnessed to obtain a major sensitizing effect to radiation and chemotherapy. To test his hypothesis he proposes the following 3 specific aims: 1) to investigate the mechanistic and biological relevance of this observed clustering of several microRNAs in the regulation of multiple epigenetic complexes; 2) to design and construct a viral-based delivery method to re-express multiple microRNAs in GBM cells thus achieving substantial reprogramming of GBM cells into a more benign phenotype; 3) to explore how multiple microRNA re-expression can affect key cellular survival responses implicated in resistance to radiation and temozolomide treatment. This is extremely relevant because GBM is characterized by multiple aberrancies in several oncogenic pathways, which can not be targeted by single drugs, but could be regulated by these microRNAs clusters and their unique ability to simultaneously target multiple proteins fundamental to tumor biology. It is also very innovative, as it proposes a new approach to investigating the role of microRNAs in GBM, and also outlines a feasible method for producing artificial DNA sequences encoding multiple microRNAs that can be used in a gene-therapy setting. The candidate works in an exceptional academic environment, where he has already been able to set up his research laboratory, and will perform his experiments and proposed research under the guidance of Dr Chiocca and Dr Godlewsky as his co-mentors. Also, Dr Ligon, an expert in Neural and GBM stem cells and Dr Haas-Kogan, expert in DNA repair mechanism in brain tumors, will function as advisors for their respective areas of expertise. The candidate has already proven himself to be a dedicated and productive researcher, as demonstrated by his publications, awards, and funding, the last in chronological order being a K12 career development award obtained last year. To further advance his career development, the candidate has outlined his plan for specific hands-on training for mastering different research methodologies, such as comprehensive RNA and protein screening, interpretation of gene transcriptional analysis, and techniques for studying DNA damage and repair. In addition, the candidate will be involved in formal coursework in grant writing and responsible conduct of research.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY NETosis was identified as a distinct mode of cell death in neutrophils more than a decade ago. Dysregulation of NETosis has been implicated in the etiology of human pathologies such as preeclampsia, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, cystic fibrosis, lupus nephritis, and coagulopathies that include cancer-associated thrombosis. The literature consistently cites the lack of a standardized methodology for quantitation of NETosis as an impediment to basic and translational research. Thus, the premise is that there is a compelling, unmet need for a standardized, quantitative and automated method for the measurement of NETosis to accelerate neutrophil and inflammation-based research and facilitate the discovery and development of therapeutic compounds. The scope of this STTR project is to develop a high-throughput image analysis and quantitation method by using high content imaging and the revolutionary technology of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the identification and quantitation of NETosis in human neutrophils. The target readout is based on the primary morphological difference between NETotic and non-NETotic nuclei--the decondensation of chromatin. This image-based quantitative method will be observer-independent and will enable robust and rapid evaluation of a large number of samples that would exceed any attempts at manual assessment. In Phase I we will complete the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Optimize and standardize the high- throughput platform for quantitation of NETosis in adherent human neutrophils. This includes standard assay optimization procedures, training the CNN to identify and quantitate NETotic neutrophil, and demonstrating that the CNN reliably distinguishes between necrosis and NETosis, whose phenotypes appear similar to the human eye. Aim 2: Validate the NETosis assay biochemically and clinically. This includes concentration-response assays with NETosis agonists, assessment of NETosis inhibitors, and evaluation of the NETotic status of Sickle Cell Disease patient samples (a disease in which aberrant NETosis has been implicated). The expected outcome of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate proof-of-concept for this automated high- throughput NETosis assay. Further, we expect to provide insight into the utility of the assay for assessment of inhibitors of NETosis as therapeutic agents. Upon completion of our Phase I aims, our Phase II program will focus on further optimizing and validating this NETosis assay and preparing it for commercialization.  ',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY Hearing loss is one of the most prevalent sensory deficits that affect one in five individuals in the United States. While the underlying etiology can vary widely, viral infections are speculated to be associated with hearing loss with a sudden onset. Lassa fever (LF), caused by Lassa virus (LASV), is a major public health threat in West Africa and is characterized by acute hemorrhagic disease and/or neurological sequelae, and up to 500,000 cases are reported annually. Approximately 30% of LF survivors develop sudden onset hearing loss weeks or months after leaving the hospital, placing a huge burden on the public health system and impacting patients' quality of life. This phenomenon is quite unique because it typically develops at later stages of the disease process, thus making LF the only viral infection described in medical literature that induces hearing loss mostly in the convalescence phase. Until now, the lack of a robust animal model exhibiting sudden onset hearing loss induced by LASV prevented the mechanistic study of this clinical feature. To address this need, we developed a novel murine model for LF that mimics many symptoms of human LF. Most importantly, our model consistently reproduced the hearing loss in animals that were recovering from infection. This powerful tool will allow us, for the first time, to study the pathogenesis of hearing loss associated with LF, in a maximum containment BSL-4 setting. The long-term goal of our research is to identify the immunological and pathological mechanisms responsible for LASV-induced hearing loss in human patients to enable future treatment. The objective of this application is to use our physiologically relevant LF mouse model to study the mechanism of LF associated hearing loss, as well as to assess auditory damage of LF survivors in West Africa. Therefore, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine the mechanism of hearing loss in LASV-infected Stat1-/- mice. We will investigate the underlying mechanism by focusing on the inner ear, as well as determining the involvement of the central nervous system in hearing loss, by studying the auditory behavior of infected mice in order to define the localization of the injury and assess histopathological changes in the inner ear. 2. Identify the role of T cells in the development of hearing loss by performing loss/gain of function experiments. We will utilize T cell depletion and adoptive transfer techniques to determine the contribution of T cells to hearing loss in infected Stat1-/- mice. We will also identify the viral antigen most essential for T cell recruitment to the auditory nerve. 3. Determine the degree of hearing loss and location of functional damage in human patients exhibiting SHL after surviving LASV infection. We propose to investigate the underlying the hearing loss in documented LF survivors in Nigeria by using noninvasive diagnostic tests routinely performed during newborn hearing screening in the USA.\",\n",
       " 'OVERALL ABSTRACT  Mast cells and eosinophils are essential effector cells in both acute and chronic allergic inflammatory responses. The overall goal of this Program is to exploit eosinophil and mast cell Siglecs (sialic acid binding, immunoglobulin-like lectins) to prevent or treat immediate allergic reactions and chronic allergic inflammation. The overarching hypothesis is that specific mAbs, endogenous tissue glycans, or synthetic ligand analogs, can specifically and selectively engage complementary glycan binding Siglecs (CD33, Siglec-6, and Siglec-8) on eosinophils and/or mast cells to prevent or limit IgE-dependent and IgE-independent eosinophil and mast cell- related allergic responses.  This application focuses on the role of three mast cell and eosinophil Siglecs that we hypothesize provide ideal targets for dampening allergic effector cell responses in a variety of acute and chronic allergy-related disorders. Dr. Bruce Bochner will serve as the PI of Project 1 (Defining Siglec-6 and Siglec-8 function on effector cells of allergic diseases as well as Core A (Administration) and Core B (Human mast cell and tissue acquisition core). Dr. James Paulson will serve as the PI of Project 2 (Siglec-targeted nanoparticles for treating mast cell mediated allergic disease) while Dr. Ronald Schnaar will serve as the PI of Project 3 (Human siglec ligands control mast cell and eosinophil mediated inflammation). This is a Program team with a proven track record of productivity and synergy.  This application includes projects that examine Siglec/eosinophil/mast cell pathways from various perspectives including pharmacology, biochemistry, cell signaling, glycobiology, and cellular and molecular biology, using in vitro experimentation and in vivo humanized models. The majority of the proposed research utilizes human material including primary human cells and biologic samples, along with animal models involving humanized mast cell mice and novel knock-in strains of mice expressing human Siglecs of interest to provide more in-depth hypothesis testing on mechanisms and outcomes that cannot yet be assessed with human research. Each Project provides numerous elements of novelty ranging from human Siglec knock-in mice to development of unique reagents for targeting specific Siglecs to discovery of endogenous human tissue ligands for specific Siglecs.',\n",

In the past 18 years, I have built a successful research program in Botswana with a focus on the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT), understanding adverse birth outcomes among infants exposed to antiretrovirals in utero, and improving survival among HIV-infected and HIV-exposed children. I have successfully mentored or co-mentored over 30 young investigators in my career, but through a K24 mechanism I can improve my mentoring expertise and expand opportunities for mentees. My K24-supported research will have the following aims: 1) to expand analyses of the virologic and immunologic predictors of successful outcomes following use of a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody as an ART-sparing intervention in a cohort of early-treated HIV-infected children; 2) to expand the objectives of existing NIH- funded nationwide birth surveillance in Botswana by adding first-ever birth outcomes surveillance of Dolutegravir-exposed infants and marginal structural modeling to simulate a clinical trial comparing birth outcomes by ART regimens used in pregnancy; and 3) to combine data from 6 large research cohorts to evaluate the reasons for declining mortality among HIV-exposed uninfected children in Botswana. My training plan will specifically expand my expertise in maternal-fetal medicine, and my mentoring plan will involve a team approach in Boston and Botswana to efficiently utilize opportunities within both large clinical trials and existing datasets and specimens.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery ? whole- cell screening of compound collections ? has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the major cause of prostate cancer (PCa) mortality. Targeting the androgens-androgen receptor (AR) axis by the second-generation endocrine therapies such as abiraterone (ABI) and enzalutamide (ENZ) has been effective initially for CRPC treatment in clinic. However, most patients develop resistance that undermines survival and quality of life and the therapy resistance is likely due to expression of AR splice variants (AR-Vs) such as AR-V7 and/or other undefined mechanisms. Prostate- specific antigen (PSA or known as KLK3) is one of the genes that are highly transcriptionally activated by AR. Despite being extensively utilized as a biomarker for PCa diagnosis and prognosis, the significance of the PSA gene or the entire genomic locus of this gene in PCa growth and survival has yet been well established. We demonstrated that non-coding RNA transcribed from the PSA enhancer, or called PSA eRNA, is aberrantly upregulated in CRPC cells in culture, xenografts and patient tissues. We further showed that expression of PSA eRNA is regulated by AR-Vs in ENZ-resistant CRPC cells. Moreover, we showed that PSA eRNA has cis-effects on PSA mRNA expression as well as broad trans-effects on expression of AR-regulated biologically important genes in CRPC cells. Mechanistically, we found that PSA eRNA contains a HIV-1 TAR RNA like (TAR-L) motif that is crucial for binding to CYCLIN T1, a key component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex and P-TEFb-mediated RNA polymerase II serine 2 phosphorylation (Pol II-Ser2p). Importantly, we demonstrated that targeting PSA eRNA with generation 2.5 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) inhibits growth of ENZ-resistant CRPC cells. Our further studies showed that eRNA transcribed from the FTO gene enhancer, one of the AR-eRNAs induced by ENZ, binds to RNA splicing factors and regulates expression of AR splice variant AR-V7 in ENZ-resistant CRPC cells. These findings support the hypothesis that aberrant expression of AR-eRNAs including PSA and FTO eRNAs acts as a new proxy of AR functional abnormality that promotes endocrine therapy-resistant growth of CRPC, thereby representing a novel target for CRPC treatment. In this application, we will determine the mechanisms by which PSA eRNA regulates gene transcription and FTO eRNA regulates AR-V7 expression in ENZ-resistant CRPC cells (Aim 1) and to determine the functional importance and clinical significance of PSA eRNA expression in ENZ- and ABI- resistant CRPC cells using mouse models and human patient samples (Aim 2). These studies will employ a comprehensive approach bringing complementary expertise in tumor biology, molecular biology, medical oncology, pathobiology, computing science and bioinformatics and biomedical statistics. Findings from the proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms that drives aberrant AR activity and therapy-resistant growth of CRPC cells, but also allow us to develop new strategies by targeting PSA eRNA to inhibit aberrant AR activity for effective treatment of CRPC.',\n",

Describe how students will participate in research activities such as planning, execution and/or analysis of research. Formal training plans (e.g., non-research activities, didactic training, seminars) should not be provided. A sound rationale should be offered as to why the approach and the research team, including undergraduate and/or graduate students, are appropriate to accomplish the specific aims and to make an important scientific contribution. Drs. Stephens and Hess have developed a 10 week laboratory module, piloted in Spring quarter of 2017, that will expose dozens of students to hypothesis-driven science utilizing whole-genomic sequencing and multidimensional phenotypic data. This portion of the supported research will have the broadest impact on student research and is detailed in multiple sections of the grant including the Introduction to the Resubmission and the Main Proposal. Santa Clara University Department of Biology does not have a graduate program, thus our research groups consist of the P.I., undergraduate researchers and a lab technician when the lab is funded extramurally. Both Dr. Stephens and Hess have a proven track record of recruiting motivated undergraduate students to collect and analyze primary data in both public health and genomics. We each have several undergraduate student co- authors, including first authors, on peer-reviewed manuscripts. We will continue to recruit and train undergraduate researchers using our methods that have proved successful. Importantly these extramural funds will provide our labs with a lab technician. This position is critical to act as primary point of contact for undergraduate researchers, especially during the academic year when the P.I.s have significant teaching responsibilities. We have recruited for these positions from amongst our best graduating research students and have had excellent success in this regard. Recent technicians supported by extramural grants used those positions to further their career paths.

       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mucormycosis, most commonly caused by Rhizopus oryzae, is a lethal infection in patients with increased available serum iron (e.g. from diabetes), or in patients with neutropenia or steroid-treatment. The population- based incidence rose by more than 50% during the first decade of the 21st century. Unfortunately, the mortality rate of mucormycosis has remained ?40%. New strategies to combat mucormycosis are urgently needed.  Using small molecule iron chelators, we found that iron sequestration can protect diabetic mice from lethal mucormycosis. However, animal models showed that small molecule chelation therapy was much less effective, and had substantial toxicity, in neutropenic mice. Consistent with this finding, the follow on clinical trial was enriched for neutropenic patients with mucormycosis, and had very few diabetics--the drug failed.  The current application is based on a novel biological approach. Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of transferrin to restrict microbial growth via iron sequestration. We showed that treatment of mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Candida albicans markedly improved survival. A major advantage of transferrin over small molecules is its safety. Small molecule chelation alters iron excretion patterns, chelating iron away from myeloid cells, which are normally the predominant recyclers of iron in the host, with resulting hematopoietic toxicity, and delivering iron to renal tubules where iron does not normally get excreted, with resulting nephrotoxicity. Thus, serious toxicity to bone marrow, kidneys, and other organ systems can occur, which offsets efficacy benefit in neutropenic hosts. In contrast, administration of transferrin utilizes and enhances normal myeloid iron sequestering routes in the body, and thus may overcome limitations of small molecule chelation, avoiding myeloid and nephrotoxicity in such patients. Specific Aims: 1. To dose-optimize rhTransferrin in treatment of mucormycosis in diabetic, steroid-treated, or neutropenic mice. Two rounds of transferrin dose optimization will be studied vs. placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint will be time to moribund condition, and secondary endpoints will include tissue fungal burden, inflammatory cytokines, and tissue histopathology with rhTransferrin vs. placebo. 2. To determine the impact of combination therapy with rhTransferrin plus liposomal amphotericin with or without an echinocandin during mucormycosis in diabetic, steroid-treated, or neutropenic mice. The efficacy of rhTransferrin alone vs. plus liposomal amphotericin (LAmB) vs. plus both LAmB and an echinocandin, will be compared to LAmB plus echinocandin without transferrin (positive control). Outcomes will include time to moribund condition, fungal burden, inflammation, & histopathology. The results of these experiments will support a follow-on R01 to define mechanism of protection, breadth of protection across fungal species and genera, and pharmacodynamics. Furthermore, results will support rapid translation of transferrin as an adjunctive therapy for mucormycosis in patients.',\n",
       " 'Mechanistic understanding of HIV-1 broad neutralizing antibody evolution Recent advances in animal experiments and clinical trials using broad neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) as prophylactic and therapeutic agents hold a great promise for more effective treatments of HIV/AIDS. In order to make the passive immunization become a real therapy, new bnAbs should be isolated and their activities should be characterized at molecular levels. However, the mechanism underlying the development of bnAbs is largely unknown and there is no vaccination regimen known to elicit bnAb effectively in vivo. BnAbs are developed in a subset of human patients after years of chronic HIV-1 infection, which exhibit great potency and breadth of the neutralizing activities. Up to date, all HIV-1 bnAbs were directly isolated from patients, which is costly, time-consuming, and completely by chance. The goal of this project is to establish an in vitro mutagenesis platform to derive new HIV-1 bnAbs, and to delineate the stepwise accumulations of mutations critical for the bnAb maturation. For most bnAbs, their germline precursors do not bind to native HIV-1 epitopes, or bind very poorly. Finding the proper antigens to stimulate the initial or intermediate precursor B cells remains a daunting task. Without proper stimulation, precursor B cells do not enter the germinal center reaction necessary for acquiring somatic hypermutations (SHM) for affinity maturation. Although the affinity selection process in germinal center is difficult to recapitulate in vitro, several human B cell lines are capable of constitutive or inducible SHM. Therefore, for the purpose of antibody diversification, mutating V regions in a hypermutating human B cell line is as good as in germinal center B cells. It can be envisioned that knock-in of bnAb progenitor genes into a hypermutating human B cell line (Ramos) can give rise to a large pool of mutants from which new bnAbs can be derived. Once this in vitro system is established, we will test two hypotheses: i) bnAbs can be evolved in vitro by mutagenizing their germline or intermediate precursors; ii) the potency and breadth of bnAbs can be further increased by SHM in vitro. The expected outcome of this project is to establish a new method of generating therapeutic bnAbs against HIV-1 (and other viruses), and a new platform for mechanistic study of the evolution of mutations critical for broad neutralizing activities. The Scientific Premise of this project is based on the promising testing results of HIV-1 bnAbs in preclinical and clinical experiments and the extensive studies of SHM in the Ramos cell line.',\n",
       " 'Abstract The goal of this proposal is to provide a foundation to prepare the applicant, Dr. Tim Heden, for a career as an independent scientist. Dr. Heden has previously undergone Ph.D. training in the field of nutrition and exercise physiology and has completed his first year as a postdoctoral trainee studying phospholipid metabolism. The proposed training plan will enhance the applicant?s scientific skills and better equip him to reach his long-term goal of becoming an independent scientist. The proposed research will identify the role of skeletal muscle mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis in respiratory capacity and substrate metabolism in skeletal muscle. PE is synthesized by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD) that resides in the inner- membrane of mitochondria. Preliminary data in mice show that exercise training increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial PE content and PSD expression, whereas an 8-wk HFD reduced mitochondrial PE content without changing PSD expression. These findings suggest mitochondrial PE may mediate the differential metabolic phenotype between muscles from exercise-trained and HFD-fed mice. To better understand the biological function of skeletal muscle PSD, we performed preliminary mechanistic experiments to examine the effects of PSD knockdown in C2C12 myotubes. A lentivirus-mediated knockdown of PSD in these myotubes reduced mitochondrial PE content, maximal respiration, fatty acid oxidation, and complex II activity, but also increased fission, mitophagy, and glucose utilization. These data suggest that mitochondrial PE biosynthesis directly regulates skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity and substrate metabolism. To gain better insight into the role of skeletal muscle mitochondrial PE biosynthesis in vivo, we generated mice with skeletal muscle- specific knockout of PSD (PSD-MKO). In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle mitochondrial PE modulates cellular respiration, and its absence results in mice that have low aerobic capacity and are more prone to developing insulin resistance. Data from these studies will provide fundamental insights into the regulation of skeletal muscle respiration and substrate metabolism and introduce mitochondrial PE as a potential key player in metabolic disease development.',\n",
       " 'This project will map the neuroanatomical connections of the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) in  both male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, a model of healthy humans, and the neurobiological  effects elicited by electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic chains that innervate the  SCGs. We expect to extend our present work that suggests that the left and right SCG have different  physiological functions and that the left and right SCG talk to one another within the brain to  co-ordinate breathing and blood pressure. This work is vital because we believe that a loss of  activity of SCG input to the brain and key structures within the body is responsible for the  expression of numerous inflammatory disorders including sleep apnea and nocturnal hypertension. As  such, we are confident that the work performed in this project will form the basis of future  development of novel stimulating devices that will be implanted around the post-ganglionic nerves  emanating from the left and/or right SCG in order to specifically treat a disease process that is  normally suppressed by the SCG projection.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the most common cause of death in the US. CVD currently claims nearly one million lives yearly in the U.S., accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths. The total cost of CVD in the U.S., including hospitalizations and lost productivity, is approximately $300 billion annually. Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for the largest number of deaths and the majority of these costs. While the efforts aimed at treating this disease in recent decades have concentrated on surgical and catheter-based interventions, limited resources have been directed toward prevention and rehabilitation. Over the last decade, the use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has increased exponentially. Between 1996 and 2007, the number of PCIs performed in the U.S. increased more than 4-fold, from approximately 300,000 to more than 1.3 million yearly. During this time, PCI has accounted for 10% of the overall increase in Medicare expenditures. In light of the extraordinary increase in the use of this technology in recent years, questions have been raised regarding the cost-effectiveness of PCI, the extent to which PCI is overused, and whether selected patients may benefit from optimal medical therapy in lieu of PCI. Despite the fact that PCI is expensive, repeat PCI is common and there is no evidence for improved survival, alternative therapies are rarely considered. One alternative therapy that has been shown to improve outcomes in PCI candidates is exercise training. In the PCI vs. Exercise Training (Leipzig) study, PCI candidates randomized to one year of exercise training had improved coronary anatomy, higher exercise capacity, an improvement in quality of life and event-free survival, as well as lower health care costs when compared to the PCI group. However, the Leipzig study employed invasive angiographic methods which do not provide information on dynamic coronary flow or atherosclerosis specifically, and do not provide insight into the mechanism of atherosclerosis progression or regression. In addition, economic analyses were limited to cost per change in Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class; the Leipzig study did not assess cost effectiveness. Given the high volume of PCI, its high cost, its lack of effect on survival and the potential for alternative treatments including exercise and risk reduction in PCI candidates, the current proposal is termed PCI Alternative Using Sustained Exercise (PAUSE). The primary aim of PAUSE is apply newer imaging technologies to determine whether patients randomized to an exercise program have greater improvement in coronary function and anatomy compared to those randomized to PCI. Both groups will receive optimal medical management. We will also compare health care costs, symptoms, quality of life, and clinical outcomes between the two groups. At baseline and one year after randomization, patients will undergo an assessment of physical activity patterns and fitness using standardized questionnaires and maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX). Patients will also undergo a detailed evaluation of coronary function and anatomy with positron emission tomography combined with computed tomographic angiography (PET/CTA). PET will be used to measure myocardial perfusion and endothelial function. CTA will be used to evaluate anatomical progression of atherosclerotic disease based on a qualitative scoring system and quantitative measurement of calcified and noncalcified plaque burden. The combination of PET/CTA provides information that previously could only be obtained invasively using coronary flow wires and invasive x-ray angiography. This will permit a noninvasive way to evaluate both functional and anatomical adaptations to exercise. Our overall objective is to demonstrate the utility of a non-invasive technology to document the efficacy of exercise as an alternative treatment strategy to PCI for coronary lesions.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobile phone technology offers a variety of opportunities for innovative approaches to health communication and intervention. These opportunities have been amplified by the emergence of next-generation smartphone devices that are capable of rich multimedia and sophisticated interactivity. Smartphone-based programs can be integrated seamlessly into a user's daily life and natural setting to deliver tailored healt messaging, interactive psychosocial activities, cognitive exercises, momentary assessments and much more. Few studies to date have evaluated strategies for leveraging smartphone applications to promote tobacco prevention and cessation, and very few examples of evidence-based tobacco control programs currently exist for this nearly ubiquitous technology platform. This 3-year Phase II STTR is proposed to enhance and evaluate a smartphone-based program, AppSPIRE, which provides tailored tobacco cessation and prevention training for adolescents and young adults. The intervention is based on an existing evidence-based computer-based program entitled ASPIRE, and is guided by the Transtheoretical Model of Change, Social Cognitive Theory, and Addiction Framework. The aims of this study are to enhance a prototype application that was found to be feasible, usable and acceptable in a Phase I study, and to evaluate the program for efficacy among 400 ethnically diverse students at a large urban community college system. The proposed research will build upon our extensive federally funded line of tobacco and youth projects utilizing behavioral theory and innovative computer technology. The application is based on the considerable experience gained in a number of highly promising tobacco projects conducted by our investigative team. This study will significantly advance our understanding of mobile phone technology-assisted tobacco control among young tobacco users. It will inform future work to investigate ways in which m-technology may be used for health communication and cancer prevention.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric retinal detachment is a leading cause of childhood blindness in developed countries. One of the common characteristics of inherited or acquired pediatric retinal detachments is the subretinal exudation of fluid, hemorrhage and lipid, causing separation of photoreceptors from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the death of photoreceptors. However, a significant portion of children re-gain limited vision once the retina re-attaches after the resolution of subretinal exudate, which indicates that some photoreceptors are able to survive the prolonged separation from the RPE. The primary aim of this research study is to characterize the neuroprotective pathways regulating the survival mechanisms to keep photoreceptors alive despite persistent ischemia and toxicity. The long-term goal of this work is to design therapeutic agents to enhance intrinsic neuroprotective pathways to improve visual recovery.  The over-arching hypothesis we are using to formulate this research proposal is that activation of retinal neuroprotective pathways inhibit photoreceptor apoptosis and prevent outer retinal degeneration during periods of pediatric exudative retinal detachment. We are proposing to identify these neuroprotective pathways using clinical samples from pediatric patients with exudative retinal detachment and characterizing them in a rodent model of exudative retinal detachment. We will test our central hypothesis with three specific aims: 1) Targeted analysis of retinal neuroprotective factors in pediatric exudative retinal detachment; 2) Functional analysis of neuroprotective proteins in rodent subretinal hemorrhage, an animal model for exudative retinal detachment; 3) Identification of novel neuroprotective and apoptotic pathways activated in pediatric exudative retinal detachment using human proteomics.  My academic appointment as a pediatric retina specialist provides the ideal environment to translate clinical problems into research questions and transform research findings into clinical tools. As a faculty member at the University of Michigan, my clinical duties will include treating children with pediatric retinal disorders and my research program will explore the neuroprotective networks that regulate photoreceptor survival in diseased retinas. My ultimate goal as a physician-scientist is to develop new therapeutic agents to improve vision in children with retinal diseases. The Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and the University of Michigan has a world-class faculty and facilities. I will benefit from thoughtful hands-on mentoring by experienced scientists and clinicians who are deeply committed to my success. This training will be further enhanced by my interaction with the leading experts in the field of pediatric retina from Oakland University and Beaumont Eye Institute. Some of the proposed experiments involve the use of proteomics and bioinformatics. The new expertise gained in these areas through hands-on biotechnology training courses and didactic sessions will allow me to apply the power of proteomics to pediatric retinal diseases.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) precede ultimate liver failure. The current epidemic of childhood obesity has increased NAFLD in children, and the global form of NAFLD due to undernutrition occurs in lean individuals with insulin deficiency. This form is also seen in intra-uterine growth restricted (IUGR) infants who express postnatal cholestatic liver disease. Despite certain standard interventions, some infants at both extremes of malnutrition, progress to requiring liver transplantation in Western countries. Many infants succumb, awaiting organs and despite successful liver transplantation develop complications. Given this dismal outlook, it is essential to discover novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets towards preventing NAFLD before biochemical features manifest and clinical complications arise. To this end, we developed in rat gestational models, undernutrition induced IUGR and high fat (HF) diet induced postnatal obesity, both developed NAFLD. Preliminarily, the adult HF or IUGR offspring, both displayed increased hepatic and serum microRNA (miR)-122, a biomarker of hepatic damage in human adults. Similar to rat, miR-122 was detected in human umbilical cord and infant sera providing the possibility of predicting hepatic disease in large for gestational age (LGA) and IUGR high risk children. Two of the novel target genes that contain complementary sequences to miR-122 in their 3'-untranslated region (UTR) are nocturnin (Noc; rhythmic output gene) and Methyl-CP-binding protein 2 [Mecp2], a nuclear protein, that binds methylated CpG islands in gene promoters. Based on our preliminary novel observations related to miR-122, Noc and Mecp2, we hypothesize that 1) hepatic miR-122 via its target mRNAs, predicts subsequent NAFLD, and 2) postnatal suppression of miR-122 can reverse the subsequent trajectory of NAFLD, possibly translating a preventive therapeutic modality to high risk children. To test these hypotheses, we plan to employ rat models of gestational exposure to a HF diet (HF offspring) versus calorie restriction (IUGR), both with postnatal exposure to a HF diet, and human umbilical cord and infant sera in the following specific aims: 1. To investigate the mechanistic role of miR-122 and its target genes Noc and Mecp2 in enhancing hepatic lipid synthesis resulting in NAFLD. 2. To examine the effect of postnatal in-vivo suppression of miR-122 on key hepatic gene expression thereby aborting development of NAFLD. 3. To explore the possibility of miR-122 serving as a biomarker in a) human LGA and IUGR infants by detection and quantification in umbilical cord serum and b) serum from older infants with established liver injury. Results of our proposed studies will provide a biomarker by which LGA and IUGR infants can be tracked for their hepatic health and a pre-clinical therapeutic strategy that prevents NAFLD. These results will provide tools necessary to translate our findings to high-risk infants towards ameliorating subsequent NAFLD, a pre-runner of liver failure with its morbidity and mortality.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder associated with a heterogeneous phenotype that includes social, linguistic, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. Anecdotal reports and selected research results suggest that individuals with ASD exhibit difficulties in motor coordination, especially when interacting with dynamic objects, like catching a ball. Yet, these challenges are not included in the diagnostic criteria. Motivated by a theory recently developed by members of this collaborative team, the overarching hypothesis guiding this project is that individuals with ASD have impairment in prediction when interacting with moving objects and events. Using motor skills that involve interaction with a ball as a first test bed for analysis, three sets of experiments aim to quantify predictive impairments. In addition, fast actions such as ball interception require feedforward control, which relies on internal prediction of limb movements. To test predictive impairments three sets of experiments manipulate time for prediction and coordinative challenges. Aim-1 examines naturalistic catching of a ball using 3D motion capture and electromyography to quantify predictive features of the complex task in ASD and neuro-typical children. Manual catching is compared to catching with a funnel that eliminates hand and finger coordination for the catch. Aim-2 examines ball interaction in a virtual set-up that affords controlled manipulation of the time window for prediction, while simplifying the coordination challenges for the hand movement. Confining ball and hand movements to one dimension, tasks will comprise kinematic and dynamic interception of a ball, the latter requiring prediction of the ball trajectory before and after contact. Computationally advanced metrics of hand movements, postural adjustments and eye kinematics relative to the ball will rigorously test the hypothesis of predictive impairment in autism. Aim-3 tests postural control and uni- and bimanual reaching to assess more elementary motor abilities, such as postural sway, reaction, movement time, and smoothness of hand movements. Potential impairments in these elementary movements will be entered as covariates in the statistical analyses. Both the theoretical framework and the rigorous experimental testing are innovative and promote a hypothesis-driven and unifying understanding of the heterogeneous profile of autism spectrum disorder. The investigator team combines Dr. Sternad's long- standing expertise in computational motor neuroscience at Northeastern University with Dr. Sinha's experience in computational neuroscience of visual cognition and autism, supported by Dr. Kjelgaard at Massachusetts General Hospital with long-standing expertise in autism. Given the safety risks to children with ASD acting in a world of dynamically evolving events, searching for the underpinnings of this pervasive impairment holds great significance. Better understanding of the disorder is relevant for making environments not only safer for autistic children and adults, but also for designing early biomarkers and interventions that address the underlying neuro-cognitive issue, i.e. prediction, and not merely the manifestations of the heterogeneous phenotype.\",\n",

These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.',\n",

       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of this project is to characterize how intratumoral heterogeneity is influenced by tumor suppressive mechanisms. Specifically, the consequence of p53 loss on the development and maintenance of cell-cell genetic diversity will be investigated, based on preliminary data from mouse models. Intratumoral heterogeneity produces a substrate for evolutionary selection and adaptation to a changing environment, for example, as cells disseminate to a new site or are challenged by therapeutic intervention (13). Acquired resistance to therapy is a major roadblock in achieving durable cures for B-cell lymphomas and other cancers (4). In many contexts, resistance has been shown to originate from pre-existing drug-resistant subclones (19, 20), and thus, the level of genetic variation in the tumor underlies the robustness of the tumor to clinical intervention. Central Hypothesis: As genetic abnormalities occur, they have a greater probability of persisting in the population, as a lack of p53 levels the playing field by reducing the differences in relatve fitness between a broader array of otherwise nonviable genotypes. The inevitable result is the accumulation of intratumoral heterogeneity. Specific aims: 1) Intratumoral genetic diversity of a collection of human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) will be measured using a single cell sequencing approach (29). The association of heterogeneity and p53 status will be investigated. 2) The role of p53 in the development of heterogeneous lymphomas will be functionally evaluated in a mouse model of B-cell lymphoma. 3) The mechanism of intratumoral heterogeneity will be explored by lineage tracing and by inactivating various p53-related sensors and effectors to determine if modification of a variety of p53-realted processes, including the DNA-damage response, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and lineage commitment, can recapitulate the diversity phenotype achieved with the loss of p53. Training Plan: The applicant will rely on an interdisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators to develop an expertise in cell & molecular biology, mouse genetics, and computational analysis of genomic data. Sufficient oncology clinical exposure will be pursued to optimize the relevance of laboratory investigations and to obtain the skills necessary for cultivating future clinical and translational partnerships. Implications/Relevance: This fellowship will effectively realize the goals of the NIH by fostering creative and innovative research regarding the cause and cure of human disease (i.e. treatment failure), and by developing the applicant to contribute over the long term to the Nation's capability to prevent disease and economic well-being through biomedical innovation.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Recent experience suggests that post-zygotic or mosaic mutations are a common cause of developmental disorders that can involve any organ system, although they are most easily recognized in vascular anomalies and skin. Several genes underlying rare syndromes with vascular anomalies have been identified, but so far only two that contribute to the more common non-syndromic forms: TEK for venous malformations and PIK3CA for lymphatic malformations, the latter recent work reported by the investigators. For both of these and several syndromic forms, the mutations are found in only or primarily in affected tissue and represent mosaic mutations.  We propose to identify and study the genes underlying other vascular anomalies using new genomics technologies. The genetics community has rapidly moved to whole exome (WXS) or whole genome (WGS) sequencing to investigate disorders such as these, but the success rate of such studies is only ~25% when germline inheritance is expected, and much lower for patchy or asymmetric disorders that suggest mosaicism. Our first aim is to develop new genomic and bioinformatics methods that will more reliably detect low level mosaic mutations using massively parallel (NextGen) sequencing approaches. We will next study how the level and distribution of mosaicism affects the phenotype, focusing first on disorders with known causative genes (initially PIK3CA) that can be evaluated reliably because of vascular and/or lymphatic involvement. Finally, we will use existing and new methods to search for novel genes underlying vascular anomalies, focusing first on more common and clinically important types such as such as arteriovenous malformations, the remaining unexplained lymphatic malformations (that is, not due to PIK3CA mutations) and hemangiomas. We expect this work to significantly expand our understanding of vascular anomalies specifically and the nature of mosaicism more broadly.',\n",
       " 'Short-term memory, the ability to hold information in mind over short timescales, is a fundamental cognitive process underlying an array of complex abilities. In contrast to long-term memory, which involves modification of synaptic connections, short-term memory is associated with sustained neural activity in cortical and subcortical structures. In particular, recent studies have suggested that the posterior parietal cortex plays a key role in maintaining mnemonic traces. However, it is not understood how the neural activity in these regions supports the maintenance of short-term memory. The goal of this project is to develop a short-term memory task for head-fixed mice and to leverage recent advances in 2-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics to dissect the neural circuits underlying short-term memory. This goal will be undertaken with the following aims: (Aim 1) Develop a short-term memory task for mice, and measure the neural signature of short-term memory in visual and parietal cortices using 2-photon calcium imaging. (Aim 2) Determine the necessity and time course of sustained activity in specific cortical regions using targeted optogenetic inactivation. (Aim 3a) Investigate the role of norepinephrine on sustained cortical activity during the short-term memory task by optogenetic modulation of noradrenergic tone. (Aim 3b) Determine whether the duration and accuracy of short-term memory maintenance can be improved by optogenetic modulation of norepinephine release. Developing a systems-level understanding of short-term memory will yield critical insights into how the brain represents and maintains information, and may have translational implications for treating deficits in short-term memory commonly observed in normal aging and psychiatric disorders.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of stem cell-based therapies is currently not being fully realized due to the lack of appropriate pre-clinical animal models. Consequently, there remains a critical need to develop better animal models that better translate results from preclinical research trials to the patient. Scientific advancements addressing this problem have been realized through the identification of a naturally occurring Severe Combined Immuno- Deficient (SCID) line of pigs. The SCID pig model has been preliminarily characterized as both T and B lymphocytes deficient and thus is deficient in adaptive immunity. The pig is known to be an excellent model for human biology due to similarities in size, physiology and genetic code; and this novel SCID model has been successfully engrafted with multiple human cancer cell lines, indicating high potential as an in vivo model for many areas of regenerative medicine testing. We have received multiple requests and interest in obtaining this model. The research areas of these interested scientists spans many areas of regenerative medicine research, from cardiac progenitor cell therapies to cartilage regeneration studies, to the use of mesenchymal stem cells for bone regeneration and wound repair, to improving treatment of graft versus host disease in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants. A pig SCID model will have a specific positive impact in that it will provide researchers with alternative and comparative models for such stem cell research. Our long-term goal is to create validated SCID models for broad use in preclinical testing of such stem cell based therapies. The specific objectives of this application are to further develop this model for regenerative medicine testing, as well as improve its ability to engraft human cells into the bone marrow so that a human immune system can develop. Such an advanced model could be broadly used for vaccine testing and the study of human-specific pathogens. To maximize the broad use of these models, we will further develop protocols and design and test biocontainment facilities for practical utilization of our current pi lines. Our rationale for the proposed research is that the SCID pig is physiologically and phylogenetically more similar to humans than the mouse and therefore may more accurately reflect how proposed stem cells will survive and function in humans. This project is innovative because a SCID pig model has not been fully developed, and development of such model may result in significantly and rapidly advancing the fundamental knowledge of SCID into translational medicine capable of accelerating regenerative medicine research. With regard to expected outcomes, the successful completion of this project will create multiple genetic resources and associated animal procedures that will be highly desirable for SCID based modeling for research projects focused on the efficacy of stem cell therapeutics. Thus these unique resources are expected to have a significant impact in accelerating the translation of regenerative medicine research into the clinic.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In parallel with major recent advances in basic immunology, opportunities for clinical exploitation of this understanding have broadened, as has our ability to perform direct assessment of immunological mechanisms in humans. This is a cornerstone of the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) approach - clinical assessment of novel tolerance therapeutics, while simultaneously evaluating the cellular, genetic and immunologic mechanisms of disease and how they are altered in response to therapy. In this renewal application, we describe the scientific and operational framework that we propose to enable the ITN to successfully accelerate the development of tolerance therapies in transplantation, autoimmunity, and allergy. We will outline a process to evolve our current strategies into the next generation of planned trials, as well as how we plan to operate a nimble, future-focused organization, poised to lead and adopt future innovations that are currently unknown. We propose a collaborative structure involving hundreds of investigators, advisors, and clinical sites working in tandem with a core group of ITN staff, operating a program that is both scientifically and financially efficient. Several new innovations recently adopted by the ITN will encourage widespread involvement from academic investigators, including expanded resource sharing and data sharing operations. Three major institutions, the Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the University of California, San Francisco, form the administrative backbone for this application, with another twenty institutions represented in leadership and major advisory roles.         RELEVANCE: The proposed Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) grant addresses major unmet health needs. In the United States, autoimmune diseases affect >5% of the population, and allergic diseases affect another ~15%. Transplantation is a life-saving intervention for organ failure, but it comes with a significant burden and risk, in each area, pre-clinical studies show that immune tolerance should be an achievable therapeutic prospect for many affected individuals. Successful tolerance offers the possibility of long-term freedom from immunosuppressive therapy, bringing a radical improvement in terms of quality of life, disease burden, and health care cost.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Lassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of Lassa fever, is a persistent global public health threat that has infected and killed more people than all Ebola outbreaks combined. Unlike Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF), Lassa fever is perennial and endemic in West Africa resulting in approximately 300,000 infections and 5,000 deaths each year, principally in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the incidence of Lassa fever is increasing, perhaps as a consequence of climate change, as is the severity and case fatality rate of the disease. As LASV has been imported into non-endemic countries ? with more than 32 cases reported, one third of which were fatal ? the significance of enhanced detection and management of Lassa fever extends beyond West Africa. Many of these deaths could be prevented with better diagnostics, supportive clinical care, and therapeutics. Yet despite being a major cause of death in West Africa, Lassa fever remains under-diagnosed, understudied, and largely ignored. For these reasons, in 2016, the WHO released a research and development blueprint call-to-action, which identified LASV as a ?top priority emerging pathogen? that is likely to cause a severe outbreak in the near future and urgently needs to be studied. Civil unrest coupled with inadequate healthcare and research infrastructure in West Africa have prevented clinical research on this high-priority pathogen, thereby limiting our understanding of the true burden of Lassa fever, the pathogenic mechanisms, and the infectivity of survivors. The primary goal of this proposal is to leverage clinical infrastructure established during the Ebola epidemic to fill critical gaps in our understanding of Lassa fever. Specifically:  ? In AIM I we will establish molecular diagnostics at Phebe Hospital in Bong county, Liberia ? a  hyper-endemic area for Lassa fever to determine the prevalence of acute Lassa fever among  admitted febrile patients as well as the seroprevalance of prior LASV exposure.  ? In AIM II we will probe putative pathogenic mechanisms of acute and convalescent Lassa fever  including immune activation, endothelial dysfunction, and persistence of viral antigens in genital compartments.  ? In AIM III we will characterize the compartmental dynamics of LASV in blood, semen and  cervical-vaginal fluid to determine the duration of viral shedding and assess the infectivity of  PCR-positive samples. We will conduct this work in the context of close and strong working relationships with healthcare leaders in West Africa and a well-developed infrastructure for clinical research we have established in Liberia where we have recruited, enrolled, and longitudinally followed and sampled over 300 Ebola survivors. Establishment of these cohorts allowed our team to determine the feasibility of our approach and develop, pilot, and refine the procedures needed to sustain high-quality data collection during the study of VHFs. This work also allows us to build and support capacity. Our team in Liberia has been trained in research methodology and is being encouraged to develop their own proposals. We have also established a state-of-the-art molecular diagnostic lab and validated a diagnostic platform for the detection of Ebola RNA in blood, semen, and vaginal fluid at Phebe Hospital and have trained this site in quality control. This experience will be applied to the study of Lassa fever. Collectively, the proposed work will provide a much-needed characterization of Lassa fever epidemiology, pathogenesis, and compartmental viral dynamics and will provide a wellspring of data that will inform public policy and individual care. Furthermore, the re-establishment of a Lassa fever center in one of the hardest hit areas will facilitate on-going research to advance the management and prevention of this deadly infectious disease. While much about Lassa fever remains understudied, it is clear that each year this infection will continue to kill more people than all other hemorrhagic viruses combined. What we propose is a series of studies that are long overdue.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four neural structures in the Drosophila optic lobes (lamina, medulla, lobula and lobula complex) sequentially process visual information through neural networks of specialized cell types organized in a retinotopic manner. We will continue our investigations to understand how neuronal diversity is generated in the developing optic lobes, which are comprised of more than 100 cell types. Our observations suggest that neuronal specification in the medulla results from the integration of three mechanisms: (i) 800 neuroblasts express a sequence of temporal transcription factors to generate distinct types of neurons as they age, each contacting one of the 800 columns innervated by photoreceptors. (ii) The temporal series is modified locally by regional transcription factors and produces neurons that innervate multiple columns. (iii) Binary fate choice via Notch further diversifies daughters of the terminal cell division. In the posterior-most region of the developing medulla and in the progenitor region of the lobula complex, neurogenesis differs significantly with a different set of transcription factors that act not only to specify neuronal fate but also to control the precursor mode of division and the death or survival of neurons. This illustrates how complex brain structures use different strategies to adapt and produce the correct number of specific cell types with the appropriate characteristics. We will investigate the mechanisms controlling this neurogenesis. Aim 1: Temporal progression of neuroblasts: Timing and transition mechanisms Temporal patterning is a general mechanism to generate neural diversity in flies and vertebrates. We will explore the molecular processes controlling the temporal progression of neuroblasts in the medulla. Aim 2. Regionalization of the medulla neuroepithelium and specialization of neuroblasts We will investigate the rules that modify the output of the temporal series in different regions of the medulla progenitor domain. This allows the local production of neurons that migrate to occupy the entire medulla. Aim 3. Correlation between transcription factor expression and neuronal characteristics To understand how transcription networks control the characteristics of neurons, we will use large-scale single cell transcriptomics to identify regulatory interactions and determine how these define the identity of each neuron. Aim 4. Regulation of the mode of neuroblast division and neuronal survival or death by temporal patterning We will investigate how temporal transcription factors act on the cell cycle and on pro-apoptotic genes to characterize the different strategies used by distinct parts of the optic lobes to produce specialized neurons. Aim 5. Temporal patterning-independent neurogenesis in lobula complex progenitors We will explore the molecular mechanisms that control a different mode of neurogenesis that produces 3 types of lobula neurons without a temporal series by controlling the rapid exit of neuroblasts from proliferation. This ambitious work will allow us to identify basic principles of neural patterning and diversity generation, which have broad implications for other neuronal systems in flies and vertebrates.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a multisystem disorder caused by defective telomere maintenance. Bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis, solid tumors, and liver disease are life-threatening manifestations of DC. The goal of our research is to understand the molecular genetics of DC, thereby opening avenues for targeted interventions that may be relevant not only to DC but also to other conditions associated with telomere shortening. Mutations in TINF2, which encodes the telomeric shelterin complex component, TIN2, are causes of DC. An outstanding question is why heterozygous and de novo mutations in TINF2 result in extreme telomere shortening and severe, early-onset disease whereas heterozygous mutations in telomerase component genes lead to more severe manifestations of disease and progressively earlier onset disease over generations in kindred's. All DC-associated TINF2 mutations reported to date, whether missense or truncating, cluster in a 34-amino acid segment located centrally within both the short (TIN2S1-354) and long (TIN2L1-451) TIN2 isoforms. Our research focuses on the unstudied TIN2L isoform, which either harbors missense mutations within the DC cluster or is not expressed when truncating mutations are present. Our preliminary data indicate that TIN2L and TIN2S are not equivalent components of shelterin and that the most common DC-associated missense mutation has deleterious effects on TIN2L but not TIN2S. Additionally, we found that TIN2L contains a conserved phosphorylation site that, when mutated, has the same functional effect on TIN2L as mutations within the DC cluster. Lastly, we found that the enhanced interaction between TIN2L and TRF2 requires TRF2-F120, a key residue within the TRF homology (TRFH) domain that serves as a docking site for various DNA-processing and DNA damage response factors. We hypothesize that TIN2L regulates the ability of TRFH domain-interacting proteins to access TRF2 and that altered TIN2L activity and enhanced recruitment of TIN2L to telomeres drives telomere shortening in patients. In Specific Aim (SA) 1 of this proposal, we will determine the relative impacts of TIN2S and TIN2L on telomere structure and function by generating an allelic series of mutant cell lines and performing complementation tests with patient-derived TINF2 mutant cell lines. We will also determine if TIN2L, compared to TIN2S, differentially interacts with other proteins in addition to TRF2 using a novel immunoprecipitation protocol followed by mass spectrometry sequencing methods. Finally, we will screen genetically uncharacterized patients with very short telomeres for specific mutations in TIN2L. In SA2, we will elucidate the function of TIN2L phosphorylation by identifying its impact on TRF2 binding and clarifying its relationship with the DC cluster through an array of in vitro and in vivo analyses. In SA3, we will determine the functional interplay between TIN2L and TRF2 TRFH domain- interacting proteins and identify how they are altered in TINF2 mutant cell lines. This work is expected to not only shed light on DC pathogenesis but also generate new paradigm shifts in telomere biology.\",\n",
       " 'The goal of this proposal is to continue studying the development of functional circuits in the retina. Immature retinal neurons spontaneously generate correlated activity in the form of waves of action potentials that sweep across the retinal ganglion cell layer. These retinal waves occur during the developmental period when functional circuits within the retina are emerging and retinal projections to the brain are undergoing a tremendous amount of refinement. Recent discoveries indicate that light penetrating through the closed eyelids may also influence retinal firing patterns during development. In this renewal, we focus on two Aims that explore the impact of early vision on retinal activity and the potential roles it plays in development and early light guided behaviors. In the first Aim, we explore the mechanisms by which spontaneous activity modulates early light responses mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) during the first postnatal week. IpRGCs, which express the photopigment melanopsin, are the first photoreceptors that mature in the retina, and they therefore provide the earliest light-driven signals to the brain. We recently published that blockade of retinal waves increase the number of light responsive cells via an increase in gap junction coupling between ipRGCs and other retinal neurons. Here we explore the mechanisms underlying this activity-dependent modulation of coupling and its function in early light-guided behaviors. In the second Aim, we investigate how retinal waves interact with these emerging visual circuits of the retina during the second postnatal week, just prior to eye-opening. Specifically we will test the novel hypothesis that light stimulation alters the properties of retinal waves and determine whether this light modulation of waves is critical for refinement of retinofugal projections. Experiments are based on state-of-the art technologies that include volumetric two-photon imaging of genetically encoded calcium sensors. This work will address the principles that establish the mechanisms underlying spontaneous activity in developing circuits and the role these principles play in activity- dependent developmental processes. It will also elucidate the principles that govern the normal development of the human nervous system, thus making it possible to understand the origin of neurological birth defects and to devise strategies that enable the nervous system to regenerate functioning neural circuits after injury.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary Chronic stress for children growing up in poverty may lead to lasting effects on social, behavioral, and cognitive development. The difficulties of living in economic hardship has, indeed, been associated with deficits in cognitive and academic performance. The current study examines the link between poverty and executive functions (cognitive processes that facilitate learning, self-monitoring, and decision making) which are known to undergo rapid developmental change during the first years of life. Early neurological development will be examined as a mediator of this association examined from pregnancy to age 3. In addition to distal risk associated with living in poverty, we will investigate critical experiences within the proximal context (i.e., language exposure, caregiver behavior, child sleep hygiene) that may mediate the effect of this risk on child structural and functional brain development. Participants (n= 230) will be seen during the 28th week of pregnancy, and at 5 visits across the first 3 years of their child's life. Neuroimaging will be conducted at 2 weeks, 15 and 24 months (with an accompanying lab visit at 15 months). We will focus on developing white matter tracts that support cognitive processes of emerging executive functions: anterior cingulum (error monitoring); uncinate (joint attention); arcuate fasciculus (language processing) and individual differences in functional brain development, including resting state networks of salience, attention, executive control, and default-mode. At 6 and 24 months of age, an intensive home visit will include observational and objective measures of caregiver behavior, language exposure (via speech recorders) and sleep hygiene (via actigraphy for 7 days). Child cognitive development will be assessed at each assessment and an executive functioning battery will be administered at 36 months of age. This study will be the first to investigate the influence of poverty on emerging executive functioning at age 3 via effects on child neurological development over the first two years of life. In addition, findings will contribute critical information regarding whether specific measures of proximal experience (language exposure, caregiver behavior, child sleep hygiene) may mediate this risk.    \",\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract A fraction of germinal center-derived B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (~12% of Burkitt lymphomas, ~9% of Diffuse Large B cell lymphomas, up to 36% of relapsed Diffuse Large B cell lymphoma cases) carry recurrent missense mutations in FOXO1, a member of the Fox-O family of Forkhead transcription factors. FOXO1 controls critical stage transitions during B cell development, and is a main target of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which relays key survival signals downstream of the B cell receptor. While FOXO1 is inactivated and thus classically regarded as a tumor suppressor in diverse cancer types and in animal models, lymphoma- associated FOXO1 mutations are predicted instead to lock FOXO1 in a constitutively active state by rendering it insensitive to PI3K-dependent nuclear export and degradation. In a recent study we found that FOXO1 is critical for the maintenance of specific B cell fate programs required for the control of zonal polarity in the germinal center. Consistently, FOXO1 null germinal centers fail to support some key biological functions that are typically associated to zonal polarity, including affinity maturation and class-switch recombination. This project seeks to understand how lymphoma-associated mutations impact FOXO1 activities in germinal center B cells, and how these events may contribute to the pathogenesis of germinal center-derived B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We propose that FOXO1 mutations actively contribute to B cell lymphomagenesis by altering the control of germinal center polarity and B cell responses to specific immune signals. To test this idea, we will develop the following specific aims: 1) Investigate how FOXO1 mutations alter B cell responses driven by stress-activated protein kinase pathways, combining in vitro and in vivo chemical genetics strategies in normal, cancerous germinal center B cells to measure and manipulate FOXO1 responses to these specific pathways; with further validation through the analysis of primary B-NHL cases; 2) Determine the impact of FOXO1 mutations on germinal center B-cell homeostasis, by engineering germinal center B cells with specific missense mutations in order to evaluate their effects on germinal center polarity and the control of germinal center-specific FOXO1 transcriptional programs; 3) Evaluate the role of FOXO1 mutations in the pathogenesis of MYC-driven B-cell lymphomas, by using adoptive transfer strategies to mimic in vivo the genetics of a fraction (~12%) of Burkitt lymphomas in which MYC deregulation and FOXO1 mutations coexist. Given the role of FOXO1 in normal germinal center physiology, the results of this study are expected to provide direct insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of germinal center-derived B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. These studies are likely to be clinically relevant because of the growing interest on PI3K inhibitors as therapeutic agents in this group of malignancies.',\n",
       " 'Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent, poorly-managed, and disabling in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). Exercise training is a promising approach for managing cognitive dysfunction in MS; however, results from previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been equivocal. This is inconsistent with the well- established literature from the general population that consistently documents beneficial effects of exercise training on cognition and brain function. Indeed, the MS RCTs suffer from significant methodological flaws and are not on par with the rigor of exercise training studies on cognition in the general population. To that end, we recently completed a line of research that identified progressive (i.e., both intensity and duration) treadmill walking exercise as an optimal exercise training intervention for improving cognitive processing speed (CPS; the most commonly impaired cognitive domain in MS) and thalamocortical resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), in particular, among fully-ambulatory persons with MS. To that end, the purpose of the present proposal is to conduct an adequately-powered, single-blind, RCT, using an active control condition for improving CPS and brain function in cognitively-impaired persons with MS at a single research site. This study will examine the effects of 3-months of supervised, progressive chronic treadmill walking exercise (designed based on pilot work) compared with a placebo control condition (i.e., stretching- and-toning activities) on CPS, fMRI (i.e., thalamocortical RSFC), and functional outcomes in 88 persons with MS who present with slowed CPS. We will collect data on CPS, thalamocortical RSFC, and functional outcomes at baseline and follow-up (i.e., at the conclusion of the 3-month intervention period) time points. We hypothesize that treadmill walking exercise training will result in significant improvements in CPS, thalamocortical RSFC, and functional outcomes. We further speculate that improvements in thalamocortical RSFC might explain exercise-related improvements in CPS. If successful, the proposed study will provide the first Class I evidence for the effects of treadmill walking exercise training as a rehabilitative approach to improve CPS, its neural correlate, and functional consequences in persons with MS who need such an intervention the most. This line of research will lay the groundwork for the development of exercise training guidelines that can be adapted by clinicians for use by MS patients for specifically improving cognition and brain health. Such an evidence-based approach for rehabilitation, using exercise training, is paramount considering the prevalent, disabling, and poorly-managed nature of MS-related CPS impairment. This is consistent with the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research?s mission to foster development of scientific knowledge needed to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of persons with physical disabilities.',\n",
       " \"Flaviviruses including dengue, West Nile, and Zika viruses, pose significant threats as emerging diseases and potential bioterror agents. Despite the considerable impact of flavivirus infection on world-wide health, no antiviral therapies are available, and existing flavivirus vaccines are of limited utility. Our long-term goal is to obtain detailed structural and biochemical information regarding the flavivirus replication complex and to use this information for the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. The flavivirus replication complex, consisting of virally-encoded non-structural proteins (NS), unidentified cellular proteins, and the viral RNA genome, is responsible for copying the viral genome and 5' RNA capping. However, how the various components of the replication machinery are arranged as a functional complex is not known. Specifically, the 5' RNA capping machinery is functionally and physically linked to the replication machinery as multi-domain (i.e., methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) within NS5) and larger multi- protein (i.e., NS3 and NS5) complexes, but little is known regarding how RNA synthesis and RNA capping are coordinated. We have recently determined the crystal structure of the full-length dengue virus (DENV) NS5, in which MTase and RdRp could coordinate their respective activities in both monomer and dimer configurations. In the current application, we will determine how NS5 interacts with viral RNA and the NS3 protein, two other essential components in the viral replication complex. In Aim 1, we will probe how NS5 interacts with the 5' end of viral RNA, called stem loop A (SLA), to promote viral RNA synthesis. We will determine the structure of the SLA by cryo-electron microscopy, and its interactions with NS5 by a competition binding assay. In Aim 2, we will determine specific interactions among NS3 and NS5 domains during coordination of RNA synthesis and 5' RNA capping using infectious DENV RNA. In Aim 3, we will determine the X-ray crystal structures of NS5 and its RNA complexes, including SLA, dsRNA, and a `dual' substrate that binds simultaneously to both MTase and RdRp domains to represent different steps along the viral replication pathway. The combined structural, biochemical, and virological studies will help elucidate the mechanism for coordinated RNA synthesis and capping reactions in NS5.\",\n",

       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Multicellular life is defined by its organization of diverse cell types into higher-order tissues and organs. Millions of cells take part in a complex synthesis of gene expression, signaling cascades, and environmental sensing to maintain normal physiology. Disturbances in these processes can lead to illness like cancer, which results from aberrant cell growth and dysregulation. Understanding how cells behave at an individual level is therefore crucial to understanding both normal and abnormal physiological states. Previous investigations into cellular diversity have been limited by available technology. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) averages transcriptomic data across all cells present in a sample; while this is sufficient for relatively homogeneous organs, it is inappropriate for complex tissues. Single-cell RNA-seq is now revealing previously unappreciated heterogeneity in systems long thought to have been uniform, such as stem cells, neutrophils, and skeletal muscle. In a typical experiment, tissues are dissociated into a single cell suspension; individual cells are isolated, either into a microwell or in a microfluidic droplet; cells are lysed; and mRNA is uniquely barcoded and collected. Throughput of these techniques ranges from a hundred to several thousands of transcriptomes obtained in a single workflow. As a result, investigators have discovered several new and rare cellular subtypes in heterogeneous tissues like the retina. While the ability to catalog cell types is rapidly increasing, the capacity to infer meaningful information about these cell types lags behind. Open problems include dissecting the gene regulatory networks governing cell states and deciding whether rare cell types are biologically meaningful. How do rare cell states arise and how are they developmentally related to common cell types? This proposal aims to develop a new technology, single cell calling cards, to address these concerns. The calling card method relies on fusing a transcription factor (TF) to a transposase which directs the insertion of a transposon into the genome near TF binding sites. These marks are recovered from genomic DNA and subsequently analyzed. Aim 1 of this proposal merges our existing method with single-cell RNA-seq to create single cell calling cards, which can simultaneously characterize cell identity and record TF binding sites. Calling card insertions are permanent and can be used to study TF localization throughout development. Moreover, they can serve as genealogical markers. Aim 2 develops new from single cell calling cards data to delineate phylogenetic relationships between cell types. Successful completion of these aims will yield new technologies to study how, and when, diverse cell fates arise.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary: One in seven men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) in his lifetime. While androgen deprivation therapy has achieved considerable success as the mainstay of PCa therapy since the 1940s, castration resistance remains common and devastating. As the third leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States, PCa results in over 26,000 deaths annually. Of patients who die from PCa, 90% are found to have bone metastases at autopsy. Strikingly, the five year survival rate for all PCa patients with spread to distant sites is 29%, while the same statistic for those with bone metastases is less than 3%. Any significant attempt to increase overall survival for patients with PCa must, therefore, be targeted to prevent, delay or eradicate bone metastasis. Tumor-derived exosomes have recently garnered significant attention for their potential as biomarkers, and also as mediators of pro-malignant signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor derived exosomes have been implicated in a diverse set of malignant processes including the epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, local and systemic immune suppression, and metastasis. The long term goal of the proposed work is to study the role of prostate tumor-derived exosomes (PCa exos) in promoting bone metastasis, and to investigate the therapeutic potential of agents capable of attenuating exosome-mediated malignant phenotypes. Preliminary evidence indicates that PCa exos are capable of (1) robust uptake efficiency in osteoclast precursors, (2) activation of NF-kB in a monocyte reporter line, (3) stimulating osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow macrophages in vitro, and (4) trafficking to bone when systemically injected in vivo in mice. Furthermore, preliminary evidence shows that a synthetic nanoparticle-based HDL mimetic (HDL NP) is capable of inhibiting each of the four PCa exo-mediated effects stated above. Given these observations, it is hypothesized that PCa exos play a role in promoting bone metastasis by signaling to osteoclast precursors to stimulate bone resorption. Further, it is hypothesized that HDL NPs are capable of reducing PCa bone metastasis by inhibiting PCa exo-mediated signaling. In the first aim of the study, we will investigate the relationship between the osteolytic activity of PCa exos and the bone metastatic potential of their tumor cell lines of origin. We will conduct molecular and functional studies of PCa exo-induced osteolysis in vitro and in vivo. In the second aim, we will investigate the role of PCa exos in promoting bone metastasis in a clinically relevant model of castrate-resistant bone metastatic PCa, assessing the impact on bone tumor establishment and growth, and overall survival. In the third and final aim of the study, we will investigate the potential of HDL NPs as inhibitors of PCa exo-mediated signaling in bone, and as inhibitors of skeletal metastasis in a bone metastatic model of PCa. Through these studies, we hope to clarify the role of PCa exos in bone metastasis, and determine the efficacy of HDL NPs as inhibitors of PCa exo-mediated signaling.',\n",
       " 'R13 ? Project Summary This application seeks partial support for the 2018 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Antibody Biology and Engineering, together with an accompanying Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) to be held on March 24- 30, 2018 at the Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco, Lucca (Barga), Italy. This is the 5th GRC and the 3rd GRS on this topic which is representative of a highly exciting and influential meeting in the community. The aim of this meeting is to provide in-depth coverage of important recent developments in the rapidly evolving field of antibody biology and engineering, in an informal setting designed for maximal discussion and interaction. This field has broad implications for a wide variety of biologic and clinically significant topics that cut broadly across the multiple fields within the biomedical community, including immunity, infectious diseases, inflammation and oncology. Furthermore, for the third time in this meeting series, we will incorporate a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS). This has proved to be a highly successful addition to the Gordon Research Conference (GRC). The GRS will run immediately prior to the GRC. It will provide seminar and poster sessions specifically for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and early career scientists to allow them to present and discuss their research. As before, a GRS keynote speaker together with the GRC chairs, will offer support and advice through a mentorship session and continuous interactions with the trainees during the course of the GRS and subsequent GRC meeting. The GRC will host approximately 28-30 talks from invited speakers, spanning topics in basic research through clinical applications with a very dynamic mix of scientists from academia and industry. It is envisioned, that an additional 10-14 shorter talks will be given primarily by young scientists, selected from submitted abstracts. In addition, the GRC will also incorporate 4 poster sessions. Taken together, the 2018 GRC will report the most significant recent research advances in an international field of antibody biology and engineering. The discoveries presented this conference are at the leading edge in the therapeutic antibody development and clinical applications. Building on the long history of creative academia-industry interactions which have characterized the three previous meetings in this series, this GRC and its associated GRS will provide an ideal opportunity for academic and bio-pharma researchers from around the world to network and forge new collaborations. We envision that novel therapeutic applications are likely to ensue from the cross pollination of the ideas that will be presented at this meeting. Furthermore, by providing opportunities for younger researchers to present their studies and to discuss their work with more established scientists, this meeting will act as an important spring board for the development of a future group of investigators in this rapidly emerging and critically important field.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Blood disorders could be cured by transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, because of lack of matched donors, many patients cannot undergo curative therapy. Thus, there is an unmet demand for engineering autologous HSPCs. The long-term goal of this project is to enable conversion of readily accessible autologous adult endothelial cells (ECs) into engraftable HSPCs. To enable this, we need to uncover the niche signals that drive the birth of human HSCs. To this end, we have devised a tractable in vitro method to reprogram readily accessible human and mouse adult ECs into hematopoietic cells. In this approach, we expressed four transcription factors (TFs), FOSB, GFI1, Runx1 and SPI1 (FGRS) in adult primary ECs along with coculture with vascular niche, to reprogram adult ECs into engraftable human HSPCs (rEC-HSPCs). While human rEC-HSPCs could engraft NSG mice, we could not assess whether these cells could give rise to functional T cells. Therefore, we isolated adult lung ECs from Runx1-IRES-GFP reporter mouse for conversion and to tract and modulate the emergence of HSPCs. We show that transient FGRS transduction of Runx1-IRES-GFP ECs along with vascular niche induction, over a 28 day period, enable transition through 3 steps of Induction-Specification-Expansion to generate repopulating mouse rEC- HSPCs. Notably, shutting off FGRS on day 28 before transplantation of CD45.2+ rEC-HSPCs was key to enable multi-lineage engraftment in 1o and 2o CD45.1+ lethally irradiated recipients. Engrafted T cells restore immune response in Rag1-/- mice eliciting adaptive immune response. Single cell clonal and limiting dilution transplantation of day 28 rEC-HSPCs show that these cells are capable of clonal expansion and contain 1/557 competitive repopulating units (CRU) thereby subsets of HSPCs represent long-term rEC-HSCs. Thus, we hypothesize that transient expression of FGRS in adult ECs along with induction by vascular and stromal niche signals will enable deciphering the hierarchy of signals that orchestrate accelerated transition of ECs to abundant engraftable long-term immunocompetent human rEC-HSPCs. These approaches set up the stage for generation of human rEC-HSCs. We will test this hypothesis by examining the following specific aims: 1) Employ non-integrative modified RNA (modRNA) delivery of FGRS TFs into adult human ECs to augment the efficiency, efficacy and safety of conversion of adult human ECs into rEC-HSPCs. 2) Identify tissue- specific specialized human vascular and stromal cell niches that orchestrate the induction, specification, and expansion of FGRS-transduced ECs into abundant immunocompetent long-term engraftable human rEC- HSPCs. 3) Decipher the role of human vascular and stromal niche derived signals, including Cxcl12:Cxcr4/Cxcr7 and BMP4/TGF-?1 in stepwise conversion of human adult ECs into rEC-HSPCs.! Collectively, our mechanistic studies will not only identify ontological pathways involved in differentiation of ECs to rEC-HSPCs, but also translate the potential of engineered autologous HSPCs to the clinical setting. !',\n",
       " 'The annual cost of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the United States is estimated to exceed $1.2 trillion by 2035, with the costs of CVD hospitalizations driving that estimate.[1] Despite this projected growth, many hospitalizations for CVD are potentially preventable if patients receive appropriate and timely ambulatory care. The role that healthcare delivery and payment reform may play in attenuating the expected rise in both the rate of CVD hospitalizations and associated costs is currently unknown. Examples of innovative models of healthcare delivery and payment include the patient centered medical home (PCMH), shared savings accountable care organizations (ACO), meaningful use of electronic medical records (EMR), and the presence of regional health improvement collaboratives (RHIC). These four approaches saw widespread adoption during the last decade. For example, between 2008 and 2014 the number of medical home sites rose nationally from 214 to 6,800. In Ohio, the number of medical home sites rose from zero in 2008 to 520 in 2014.[2] Despite this rapid growth, uncertainty exists about the effect of these four approaches on patient outcomes and cost of care for cardiovascular conditions. For chronic illnesses such as CVD, these approaches demonstrated early successes across a range of disease management indicators such as provider experience,[3] patient experience,[3-5] processes of care,[5, 6] preventive care utilization,[7] and high cost care utilization.[3] Importantly, prior studies of the effects of these paradigms on potentially preventable CVD hospitalization have focused on each approach individually and have not addressed associated costs. Moreover, no prior study has mapped the evolution of the healthcare market penetration of these four approaches. Thus the question of whether and how the growing healthcare market penetration of these four approaches affects the hospitalization rate and costs for CVD remains unanswered. The overall objective of this proposal is to address this question with two specific aims: first, to quantify the healthcare market penetration of patient centered medical homes, shared savings accountable care organizations, regional health improvement collaboratives, and electronic medical records throughout the state of Ohio; second, to model the relationship between changes in the rate of CVD hospitalization and changing healthcare market penetration of each of the four approaches. Successful model development will empower policy makers to make data-driven decisions regarding further implementation and support of integrated models of healthcare delivery and payment transformation that will help improve care quality and reduce costs.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary/Abstract - The long-term goals of the proposed research program are to provide insight into the complex dialogue that occurs each generation between humans and their microbiota during the critical period following birth. Recent research has indicated a strong correlation between outcomes of these early events and life-long health. However, the inaccessibility of colonized tissues and high diversity of the microbiota renders an in-depth study of early colonization of human tissues extremely challenging. When faced with such complex phenomena, biologists often turn to simpler model systems to provide insights into evolutionarily conserved features and reveal basic principles. To decipher the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of bacterial associations with apical surfaces of mucosal epithelia, the proposed program exploits the binary symbiosis between the bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its squid host, Euprymna scolopes. This relatively simple association has been studied for over two decades as a model for the chronic colonization of mucosa by Gram-negative bacteria. As in humans, the squid-vibrio association begins anew each generation, requiring a `winnowing' of other environmental bacteria that results in persistent association restricted to the coevolved partners. In this system, the process of symbiosis initiation occurs across ~100 microns over minutes to hours. It can be directly imaged in its entirety using confocal microscopy, which offers the rare opportunity to define, with high temporal and spatial resolution, the reciprocal molecular and biochemical dialogue that results in the establishment of a specific, life-long beneficial symbiosis. This project brings together two collaborators, each with expertise in the biology of one of the symbiotic partners, and introduces new technology to the study of host-microbe interactions, including: Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS), which allows precision tracking of symbiont molecules into host tissues; Hybridization-Chain-Reaction Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (HCR-FISH), which enables visualization of rare transcripts in host and symbiont cells; NanoString, a new technology for simultaneous analysis of dozens to hundreds of targeted transcripts; and high-efficiency RNAseq, which produces robust transcriptional libraries from as little as 10 ng total RNA (~105 bacteria). Specific aims to be addressed are: (1) the examination of how symbiotic bacterial strain variation affects symbiosis onset and persistence; (2) the characterization of outer membrane vesicle (OMV) contents, their trafficking into host cells, and host responses to OMV cargo; and, (3) the investigation of the roles of vibrio virulence determinants in a non-pathogenic association. An understanding of the human microbiome is in its infancy, and this frontier field is currently at the stage of building paradigms. Within this context, as the squid-vibrio system has in the past, the results of the current study will shed light upon fundamental principles governing the onset of both beneficial and pathogenic associations.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injury to the renal proximal tubular epithelium (PTE) represents the underlying cause for acute kidney injury (AKI) following exposure to various stresses including ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and nephrotoxins. Kidney cells possess intrinsic mechanisms that can be activated to protect their survival under stress conditions. Facilitating repair of PTE cells will have beneficial effects in the treatment of AKI; however, the knowledge gap in understanding the mechanisms associated with repair of injury to these cells has been a setback in the development of novel therapies for AKI. Our group previously identified MG53, a novel member of the TRIM family protein, as an essential component of the cell membrane repair machinery. Although native MG53 protein is predominantly expressed in striated muscles, it is also present in the kidney particularly in PTE cells at a low, but significant concentration. PTE cells derived from the Mg53-/- mice are more vulnerable to membrane injury than normal cells, a phenotype that is also observed in striated muscles, suggesting that MG53 contributes to repair of renal epithelial cells. Compared with wild type mice, the Mg53-/- mice develop renal disorder and are more susceptible to I/R- induced AKI. We found that the recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) protein can cross the glomeruli and target to injury sites on PTE cells to facilitate the renal protective effect against various stresses. Intravenous administration of rhMG53 could protect I/R and cisplatin-induced injury to the kidney in rodent models. These data suggest that upregulating the MG53-mediated repair mechanism in PTE cells may be beneficial in preventing AKI and treating established AKI. Since native MG53 is present in circulation, systemic administration of rhMG53 would be unlikely to induce an immune response, and potentially be a safe biologic approach for treatment of AKI. The long-term goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that MG53 contributes to maintenance of renal function under physiological conditions, and targeting MG53-mediated repair of injury to PTE cells represents an effective means for prevention and treatment of AKI. Two specific aims are proposed: a) to elucidate the mechanism for MG53-mediated membrane repair in maintenance of renal function under physiological and AKI conditions; and b) to conduct proof-of-concept studies on rhMG53- based therapy for prevention or treatment of AKI. Fulfillment of these studies should advance our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the protection of renal cells from stress-induced injuries, and help development of novel therapies for prevention and treatment of AKI.',\n",
       " 'FAM46C (Family with sequence similarity 46, C) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in multiple myeloma (found in over 20% of the patients). Mutations of other FAM46 family members (A, B and D) are also associated with various human diseases. Despite the strong connections with diseases, the functions of FAM46 in either physiological or pathological settings are unknown. The goal of the project is to fill the knowledge gap on the functions of the FAM46 proteins and the underlying mechanisms, paving the way for developing therapeutic strategies for the associated diseases. The project is based on our preliminary work showing the direct physical interactions of FAM46 with polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) and BRCA2 and CDKN1A(p21) interacting protein (BCCIP). Plk4 is the master regulator of centrosome duplication and ciliogenesis. BCCIP has been shown to be involved in regulating DNA repair and centrosome duplication. These together suggest that the FAM46 proteins regulate centrosome duplication, ciliogenesis and DNA repair. Centrosomes organize the bi-polar spindle formation and proper chromosome segregation in the cell cycle. In non-dividing cell, centrosomes mediate the formation of primary cilia, specialized signaling organelles critical for organogenesis and tissue homeostasis. A role in regulating these processes are consistent with the strong connection between FAM46 mutations and cancer. These hypotheses will be tested in three aims by combining X-ray crystallographic, biophysical, biochemical and cell-based functional approaches. Aim 1 will be focused on biophysical and structural analyses of the FAM46/Plk4 interaction. These studies will reveal the binding mode between FAM46 and Plk4, and identify key residues that can be tested by mutations in functional assays. In addition, potential mutual regulation of the enzymatic activities between FAM46 and Plk4 will be analyzed. Aim 2 will be focused on biophysical and structural analyses of the FAM46/BCCIP interaction. The crystal structure of the FAM46 and BCCIP complex will be determined to elucidate their interaction in atomic detail. Structural analyses will also be directed at the potential FAM46, Plk4 and BCCIP? tripartite complex. Mutational analyses will follow to test the binding mode and interface residues. The goal of Aim 3 is to analyze the roles of the interactions among FAM46, Plk4 and BCCIP? in regulating centrosome duplication, ciliogenesis and DNA repair. Fluorescence microscopy will be used to probe the localization of FAM46, Plk4 and BCCIP?, and their colocalization in and out of centrosomes in various stages of the cell cycle. The regulation of centrosome duplication, ciliogenesis and DNA repair by FAM46 through the interactions with Plk4 and BCCIP will also be analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.',\n",

However, despite important research into the biologic and molecular functions of Myc, no tractable therapies have emerged to inhibit this oncogenic transcription factor. TNBC and other Myc-driven cancers remain recalcitrant to current targeted therapies, underlining the urgent need to identify new vulnerabilities in these malignancies.  In addition to promoting tumorigenesis, oncogenes such as Myc also produce unique stresses in cancer cells, collectively termed oncogenic stress. Using parallel whole-genome RNAi screens, we discovered that Myc imposes a new type of oncogenic stress on TNBCs that we term RNA splicing stress, or RSS (Kessler, Science 2012; Hsu, Nature 2015). In many cancer types, Myc (or other oncogenic insults) globally amplifies transcription leading to increased pre-mRNA burden on the spliceosome. Consequently, Myc-driven TNBCs are exquisitely sensitive to modest perturbations in the spliceosome (by enhancing RSS). Importantly, pharmacologic or genetic inhibitors of the spliceosome impair primary and metastatic progression of TNBC and are well tolerated in animal pre-clinical models. While spliceosome inhibitors have entered clinical trials, the mechanisms by which RSS and spliceosome inhibitors selectively kill cancer cells are unknown. Herein, we propose to discover the pathway(s) sensing and responding to RNA splicing stress and to delineate the mechanisms by which RSS triggers cancer cell death. Aim 1: Delineate the dsRNA-sensing pathways (DSP?s) stimulated by RSS in Myc+ TNBCs in vivo. Our preliminary data suggest that RSS induces TNBC apoptosis by triggering innate immune pathways that detect and respond to dsRNAs. By leveraging a TNBC PDX cohort with new genetic and proteomic platforms, we will determine how DSP?s and other stress response pathways are activated in response to spliceosome inhibition. Aim 2: Discover how RSS triggers dsRNA-sensing pathways in TNBCs. Many viral pathogens encode dsRNA genomes that are detected by dsRNA-sensors of the innate immune system. Our studies indicate RSS leads to cytoplasmic accumulation of intron-retained mRNAs, a potential source of dsRNAs. Using new sequencing and single-molecule microscopy methods, we will study the mechanisms by which RSS shapes the secondary structure and subcellular localization of TNBC transcriptomes and stimulates dsRNA-sensors. Aim 3: Delineate how DSPs and other stress response pathways govern TNBC response to spliceosome inhibitors. We hypothesize that there is a coordinated cellular response to RSS that parallels well-studied homeostatic stress responses like the unfolded protein response. By leveraging forward genetics and identifying new regulators of RSS, we propose to unveil a genetic framework for this novel type of cellular stress and provide new therapeutic inroads that exploit this cancer vulnerability.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Antibodies are routinely used as therapeutic agents to fight a wide range of disorders including asthma, blood cancers, breast cancer, arthritis, and transplant rejection. Humoral immunity against infections depends on the germinal center (GC) differentiation process in the B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs, such as spleen and lymph nodes. In GCs, B cells rapidly proliferate and somatically mutated high-affinity antibody secreting cells, i.e. plasma cells, are generated from naÃ¯ve B cells in response to T cell-dependent antigen. To date, the scientific community has relied on animal models to generate high-affinity antibodies and discover fundamental knowledge of GC immunology. Yet scientists are far from understanding the extracellular and intracellular factors that contribute to the exuberant pace of the GC reaction and conversion to antibody secreting cells (ASCs). Recent in vivo studies have uncovered crucial signals such as CD40 ligand (CD40L) from T cells, B cell activation factor from follicular dendritic cells, cytokines, and integrin ligands from the surrounding lymphoid niche, that are required for the induction of GCs and selection of high-affinity cells. Developing biomaterials to recapitulate the process of generating high affinity, antigen specific antibodies ex vivo via the GC process could enable more rapid development of antibodies for use in the treatment of a number of chronic diseases. Such tissue models can also be used to improve the mechanistic investigation into signaling and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate GC B cells. The goal of this study is not to recapitulate all aspects of an in vivo model, but rather to generate a model that will inform the natural process in vivo, and also the development antigen-specific ASCs ex vivo. The specific aims will focus on engineering designer organoids with tunable ligand specificities, understanding the antigen specific immune response, and establish a link between integrin ligand specificity and cell cycle epigenetics of GC reaction.',\n",
       " 'Despite the availability of an effective vaccine and drugs that can suppress viral replication, hepatitis B virus (HBV) continues to impose an enormous global health burden. Over 240 million individuals are chronically HBV infected worldwide, causing chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV is classified into genotypes based on genetic diversity. The predominant genotype in West Africa, genotype E (GT/E), is generally not found elsewhere in the world however isolated cases resulting from spread directly from Africa are now being identified. HBV GT/E has low genetic diversity, a short evolutionary history, yet in less than 200 years has become the predominant HBV genotype in West Africa. With the rapid emergence of HBV GT/E in Africa and the inevitability of its spread to other continents, there is a public health urgency to understand the biology of HBV GT/E. The current HBV vaccines consist of HBsAg derived from genotype A2. Likewise, many commercial HBV screening assays utilize antibodies directed against HBsAg. Mutations in the S gene can lead to failure of commercial assays to detect HBsAg and vaccine resistance. Potentially relevant to the rapid spread of HBV GT/E high rates of ?occult disease? (HBsAg- /HBV viremia +) have been described in West Africa as well as simultaneous detection of both HBsAg and anti-HBs. Notably, HBV GT/E has a consensus mutation in the pre- S1 region introducing a new start codon; it is not known if this results in a novel S polypeptide and/or impairs translation of the other S proteins, but in total these findings raise concern that variations in S gene expression of HBV GT/E may alter host recognition, reduce efficacy of diagnostic assays and/or avoid vaccine protection. Because several lines of evidence suggest that HBV GT/E is of public health concern, yet we know nothing about the biology of this new genotype or its relationship with the host vaccine response, detection by standard assays, and other HBV genotypes, we proposes to create the necessary HBV GT/E experimental systems and investigate the biology of HBV GT/E in order to assess the risk this new HBV genotype poses to public health. Broadly, we hypothesize that HBV GT/E may have a selective advantage over other HBV genotypes. Specifically, we hypothesize that either consensus sequence differences in the S gene region of HBV GT/E may lead to altered to expression of the HBV S genes, changes in the S proteins that evade vaccine induced antibody recognition or perhaps that it can out compete other HBV genotypes due to more efficient replication and/or spread. To test these hypotheses, we propose 3 specific aims: 1) Elucidate the impact of HBV GT/E S region consensus sequence differences on S protein expression and immunogenicity; 2) Determine whether HBV GT/E replication / infection is more robust that other HBV genotypes;3) Identify the frequency of HBV GT/ E viremia in vaccinated individuals from the West African country Ghana.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary In healthy individuals immune tolerance is maintained by populations of regulatory T-cells, including Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (Treg). In individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS), Treg numbers are normal in circulation but deficient at sites of autoimmune demyelination. Further, cells from these individuals function well ex vivo but fail to prevent autoimmunity in situ. These data implicate local defects in Treg homeo- stasis in the pathogenesis of RR-MS. However, the factors that regulate Treg homeostasis within peripheral tissues are unknown. A critical factor that governs Treg homeostasis is the cytokine interleukin 2 (IL-2) and downstream signaling through STAT5. Without this signaling, Treg revert to being conventional T cells (Tconv) or die. Since Treg cannot make IL-2 themselves, most of what they need comes from other T cells at sites of inflammation. How- ever, IL-2 has a very short half-life in vivo (<6 minutes) because it is very rapidly sequestered into the extracel- lular matrix (ECM) near where it is made. This is particularly a consequence of its binding to heparan sulfate (HS)-containing structures. Nonetheless, ambient IL-2 supports Treg stability and function at sites of recent inflammation, suggesting that these cells may be able to access this resource. We have identified a novel role for heparanase (HPSE), a cell-surface enzyme that binds and digests HS, in supporting Treg access to tissue IL-2. We find that HS-bound IL-2 is more potent than free (unbound) IL-2 in promoting Treg survival but only if cells express HPSE. Consistent with this, HPSE-/- mice have fewer Treg. Concomitantly, HPSE-/- Treg also have impaired phenotypic stability upon transfer in vivo. These effects of HPSE on Treg homeostasis may be mediated at the level of interactions between IL-2 and the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). We find that HS-bound IL-2 potently induces STAT5 signaling in wildtype, but not HPSE-/- Treg. Because IL-2/IL-2R interactions typically trigger internalization and clearance of IL-2 as well as signal- ing, our preliminary data suggest that HPSE may stabilize HS/IL-2/IL-2R complexes in ways that prolong IL-2 signaling. This may be a fundamental mechanism governing Treg survival and function in peripheral tissues. In light of these exciting preliminary data, we hypothesize that FoxP3+ Treg use HPSE to access IL-2 bound to HS within tissues. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will define the role of HPSE in Foxp3+ Treg homeosta- sis and function. Then, in Aim 2 we will elucidate how HPSE potentiates IL-2R signaling. Together, these aims represent a bold, imaginative, and unconventional approach to studying immune homeo- stasis in peripheral tissues. This work will provide the mechanistic foundation needed to support R01 level re- search into the role of HPSE in human MS and the development of novel therapies targeting HPSE to promote immune tolerance.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary  Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a major global health problem and development of new interventions requires better understanding of the biological mechanisms used by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to cause infection. Mtb must continuously sense and respond its host environment during infection, and cyclic nucleotides are a critical part of this response in Mtb. Cyclic 3',5'-AMP (cAMP) is a universal signal molecule used by both microbial pathogens and their mammalian hosts to sense and respond to environmental cues. cAMP plays central roles in both bacterial virulence gene regulation and modulation of host response by several major bacterial pathogens, including Mtb. cAMP is produced by adenylyl cyclases and degraded by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) to maintain signaling pathway sensitivity and specificity. Mtb encodes numerous adenylyl cyclases and cAMP-binding effector proteins but only one cAMP PDE (Rv0805) has been identified. Preliminary data indicate that Rv0805 is required for Mtb persistence in a murine model of infection, but its mechanism remains unclear. In addition to hydrolyzing cAMP, Rv0805 has robust activity against 2',3'-cAMP and 2',3'-cGMP, which are products of RNA cleavage, and it has been shown to stabilize cell wall function and regulate gene expression on a global level through unknown mechanisms that may not require cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis. The scientific premise for this proposal is that Rv0805 is a multifunctional protein that contributes to TB pathogenesis, but the importance of RV0805's specific activities for Mtb biology, including virulence, are not known. We hypothesize that Rv0805 has important roles in Mtb biology beyond cAMP hydrolysis that may include both gene regulatory and RNA damage responses. Major goals of this proposal are to determine the importance of Rv0805's catalytic activities for Mtb-host interactions, gene regulation and cAMP homeostasis while establishing whether Rv0805 has the potential to engage in RNA repair. This information will provide a critical basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying Rv0805's role in Mtb biology, particularly during infection.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is one of the most prevalent inflammatory diseases in the U.S., affecting up to 16% of the population and substantially diminishing the quality of life and productivity of patients. In four years, the annual U.S. health care expenditure to treat patients with CRS dramatically increased from $9B to $64B (5% of the health care budget), with a corresponding rise in surgical treatment for those 20% of patients who fail current medical management. Despite these staggering statistics, CRS remains an under-researched epidemic with limited effective treatment options. GlycoMira?s lead candidate, GM-1111, is a synthetic glycosaminoglycan that inhibits multiple inflammatory mediators and more specifically, targets Toll-like receptor 2-mediated signaling. Moreover, topical intranasal administration of GM-1111 effectively reduces chronic sinonasal inflammation in mice. Animals treated with GM-1111 showed significant reductions in degenerative histologic changes, inflammatory cell infiltration, goblet cell hyperplasia, and cytokine gene expression within the sinonasal tissues. Herein, GM-1111 will be further developed and validated as a commercially viable and effective therapy for CRS. In Aim 1, the optimal dosing regimen and degree to which GM-1111 effectively treats CRS will be determined by testing a wide range of doses and dosing frequencies in animal models of CRS. The efficacy of GM-1111 will be compared to healthy, inflammatory, and therapeutic controls by analyzing the clinical signs, histologic changes, and inflammatory tissue biomarkers associated with CRS. In Aim 2, the potential mucolytic properties of GM-1111 will be investigated, and the effect of GM-1111 on ciliary function will be determined. Increased mucus production and impaired mucociliary clearance are central to the pathogenesis of CRS and elevate the risk of opportunistic pathogen infection. Based on mechanistic evidence with a similar glycosaminoglycan, topically administered GM-1111 should penetrate mucus and reduce sinonasal inflammation. To test this hypothesis, the effects of GM-1111 on artificial mucus with known mucin and bacterial composition, nasal secretions from patients with CRS, and ciliary function using sinonasal tissue from controls and patients with CRS will be investigated. The efficiency of GM-1111 to penetrate mucus and tissue to effectively reduce sinonasal inflammation will then be determined in an animal model of CRS characterized by a robust mucus response. These studies will provide crucial preclinical data supporting GM- 1111 as a commercially viable and effective therapeutic for treating the millions of patients affected by this debilitating disease.',\n",
       " 'No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, ?it is difficult to diagnose a negative?. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  There are currently no approved vaccines for most emerging biological pathogens (Ebola, Chikungunya, MERS CoV, SARS, Zika), opportunistic infections (S. aureus, Candidiasis, adenovirus) or potential bioterrorism agents (Y. pestis, B. Pseudomallei, F. tularensis, Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae), and therapeutic interventions such as antibiotics and antivirals are only effective for a select few pathogens. A promising approach for rapidly neutralizing the risk of pathogen exposure is the use of immunomodulators capable of eliciting a robust innate immune response within hours of administration that would provide protective resistance against a wide range of biological agents. Innate immunity has evolved as a first line of defense against invading pathogens and acts through highly conserved pattern- recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) to coordinate the innate inflammatory response to both endogenous and exogenous stimuli.  The objective of this Phase I research proposal is to initiate an investigation of structure-activity relationships within a new class of chemically and metabolically more stable synthetic TLR4 agonists in order to identify the structural requirements for the development of a broad-spectrum immunomodulator that would provide non-specific protective resistance (NSR) against a wide range of biological agents. In addition to potentially providing weeks-long NSR against a wide range of viruses and bacteria, the improved stability profile of these synthetic immunomodulators should improve thermal stability leading to a longer shelf-life and avoidance of cold-chain requirements for distribution.  Aim 1 will focus on (i) the synthesis of six new TLR4 agonists in which the labile ester and phosphate groups are replaced with more stable bioisosters, and (ii) evaluation of the stability of these new agonists in aqueous formulations. Aim 2 will evaluate the biological activity of the new compounds in vitro for (i) TLR4 species-specificity and potency in a TLR4 specific reporter assay and (ii) cytokine induction from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  This phase I research proposal and subsequent phase II have the potential to develop broad- spectrum immunomodulators that would provide non-specific protective resistance (NSR) against a wide range of biological agents, and is primarily targeted for preventing upper respiratory tract infections in individuals or populations at risk for emerging or opportunistic pathogen exposure. Such treatment could help prevent deaths associated with seasonal or pandemic influenza viruses as well as other respiratory pathogens of significant medical concern.',\n",
       " \"Abstract Despite the advent of biological therapies, glucocorticoids (GCs) remain the most widely prescribed medicines for the management of inflammatory diseases such as lupus, asthma, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, long term and high dose GC use is inevitably accompanied by systemic toxicity. There are no adjunctive therapies that could enhance the disease modifying effects of GCs at low doses thus minimizing their dose-dependent toxicity. The long-term product goal of this Phase I SBIR project is a small molecule GC adjunct that will enable an efficacious GC regimen at non-toxic doses. To accomplish this goal, we propose an innovative strategy to improve GC responsiveness by blocking macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a proinflammatory cytokine known for its ability to antagonize GC action. We will block MIF function using a novel family of small molecule MIF inhibitors and a MIF-specific monoclonal antibody and evaluate the therapeutic effect of this blockade in restoring GC response in a GC-resistant autoimmune disease model. For the purpose of this study, we have already developed a unique mouse model of autoimmune disease that is refractory to GC treatment. In this model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the rodent equivalent of multiple sclerosis, we discovered that female mice develop fulminant and lethal disease despite GC treatment, and that disease progression can be effectively halted by neutralizing MIF activity. Building from this observation, we have developed a rigorous experimental plan to interrogate the therapeutic effect of MIF inhibition in restoring GC responsiveness in the EAE mice. The achievable milestone for this Phase I SBIR project is efficacy evaluation of two novel small molecule MIF inhibitors and one MIF-specific monoclonal antibody in restoring GC response in the GC-resistant EAE mice. The scientific premise of this study is based on a vast body of literature on the interactions between MIF and GCs, and the relevance of this regulatory dyad in contributing to clinical resistance to GC therapy. A successful outcome of this study will lay the foundation for further pre-clinical development of a novel and `first-in-class' adjunctive therapy that would enable prolonged use of lower and non-toxic doses of GCs in autoimmune patients.\",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Reducing HIV incidence requires a ?precision public health? approach encompassing prevention campaigns, targeted interventions, and ?next-generation? surveillance through multimodal instruments, including sequencing. Molecular epidemiology methods (phylogenetics and phylodynamics) have recently gained traction for use in identifying and tracking epidemic transmission clusters, as well as reconstructing the demographic history of viral pathogen populations. However, such methods are not equipped to identify both transmission clusters and their corresponding dynamics in real time, and transmission clusters are assumed to be unrealistically static over the course of the epidemic. Consequently, scientists, and/or clinicians, cannot distinguish between growth or decline of a sub-epidemic nor determine the sources ?local or external? driving regional epidemic incidence. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a novel theoretical and technical framework able to model dynamically HIV transmission clusters over time by analyzing large, longitudinal sequence data. Our new tool for dynamic identification of transmission epicenters (HIV-DYNAMITE) will aid in monitoring, in real time, hyper-connected and/or long-lasting clusters fueling emerging HIV regional epidemics. As an application study, we will focus on the ongoing HIV epidemic in Florida. Florida has the highest incidence of HIV in the United States (US) due to a unique set of circumstances fostering an ongoing statewide epidemic. HIV infections are rising amongst men who have sex with men, minority, and immigrant/tourist populations. Risk assessment of the epidemic thus needs to be contextualized, taking into account both local determinants as well as inflow from other states and/or countries. In collaboration with the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), we seek to identify and predict infection trends as well as virus spread within Florida and among neighboring destinations by applying HIV-DYNAMITE to the extensive FDOH viral sequence dataset (>44,300 sequences) collected over the past 10 years coupled with geo-demographic information. We will validate the system using newly obtained longitudinal data and design intervention strategies through focus groups with the FDOH and other stakeholders. We aim to both complement and enhance existing efforts, such as the CDC?s HIV-TRACE, which is currently based on sequence data only, which also lacks dynamic or geographic spread components. The interdisciplinary expertise of the team renders this project feasible, and the proposed approach has the potential to be incorporated into other settings within the US with comparable statewide surveillance and virus sequencing coverage through national reference centers.',\n",
       " 'Abstract As much as 90% of HIV-1 infections occur by transmission at mucosal surfaces. Combating the earliest events in viral entry is one strategy to combat HIV infection, since it is thought that fewer virions successfully infect the host at mucosal surfaces. Vaccines that also stimulate the systemic immune system are also needed to control HIV spread once the mucosal barrier is breached. Systemic immunization by the intramuscular route can drive mucosal immune responses, but there is also data showing that mucosal immunization may better educate responses that can act at these first sites of mucosal HIV entry. We performed vaccine route comparison studies in rhesus macaques that showed that vaginal mucosal vaccination reduced SHIV-SF162P3 viral loads better than intramuscular immunization. We more recently we performed an immunogenicity study that compared the effects of vaccine routes using new replicating single- cycle adenoviruses (SC-Ads) boosted with recombinant gp140 env. Animals immunized by only the intramuscular route had lower final SHIV neutralizing antibodies in their plasma than animals immunized by intranasal alone or intranasal and intramuscular vaccinations. Intramuscular animals had high T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in the blood, but low Tfh in lymph nodes. Conversely, animals immunized by the intranasal route had high Tfh in lymph nodes, but low Tfh in the blood. Animals immunized by the intramuscular route had lower antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activities than animals immunized by the mucosal intranasal route. These data suggest that the route of priming and boosting with gene-based and protein vaccines may markedly affect the quality and quantity of systemic and mucosal immune responses against HIV. In this project, we will build on these interesting vaccine route observations in a team consisting of groups from Mayo Clinic, MD Anderson, and the Oregon Health & Science University. We will combine our new SC-Ad vaccines with promising SOSIP protein vaccines and deliver these by a more potent synchronous co- immunization strategy. We will test how systemic vs. mucosal vaccination drives different systemic and mucosal immune responses with key analyses of effects on mucosal cell trafficking, Tfh production, and the production of functional antibodies in systemic and mucosal compartments. We will pursue these efforts in the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Optimize synchronous vaccine strategies that utilize multiple routes of immunizations to achieve potent systemic and mucosal humoral and cellular responses. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the protective efficacy and immune correlates of synchronous systemic and mucosal vaccination against repeated low dose mucosal challenge by clade C SHIV in rhesus macaques.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT ? Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and  early treatment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in ~40-60% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially contributes to poorer clinical outcomes. Yet, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, little is known about how these two conditions co- emerge early in life. Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of the comorbidity of ASD and ADHD, the overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to characterize how co-occurring ADHD influences early screening, neural signatures, developmental trajectories, and response to early treatment of young children with ASD. Project 1 will characterize risk factors for and emergence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children at risk for ASD and examine how these symptoms influence early detection and progression of ASD. This project will clarify why children who have co-occurring ADHD are diagnosed at a much later age and inform more effective early detection strategies. Following a large sample of toddlers receiving routine care in Duke pediatric primary clinics (N = ~ 2800 patients/year), Project 1 will prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and collect data on risk factors, ADHD, and developmental outcomes. Project 2 will elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and attention-related biomarkers related to ASD and ADHD, examine the functional impact of co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD, and identify precursor characteristics during infancy that are predictive of later emergence of comorbid ASD and ADHD. This project will characterize children with ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ADHD alone, and typically-developing children, using state-of-the-art methods, including neurophysiology, eye-tracking, movement-tracking, and computer vision analysis. Project 3 will evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie response to treatment. This project will accomplish these goals by evaluating whether stimulant treatment (Adzenys-XR-ODT) augments the efficacy of a parent-delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model. This project will examine whether changes in outcome are correlated with improvements in social attention, measured via eye-tracking biomarkers, and social engagement during parent-child interaction. This project will also examine neurophysiological changes underlying improvements in behavior. These projects will be supported by four cores: Administrative Core, Recruitment and Assessment Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and Dissemination and Outreach Core. Functioning as a whole, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will offer the most comprehensive understanding to date of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, providing important information that will allow for biologically informed and personalized methods for early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of co-occurring ADHD on individuals with ASD.

       " 'Pediatric cardiovascular disorders, which comprise congenital heart defects (CHD) and myocardial and conduction system diseases, remain highly challenging due to cardiac co-morbidities and premature mortality. As most of these disorders are genetic, efforts over the past 30 years have focused on identifying their causal mutations. Particularly for Mendelian traits such as Noonan syndrome and related disorders (the RASopathies), this has been highly successful. Newer genomic technologies have accelerated gene discovery for pediatric cardiovascular disorders, including genetically complex ones. These genetic discoveries are improving care through more accurate diagnosis, better prognostication, and refinement of clinical trial design. What has not occurred with rare exception is the development of novel therapies based on the new understanding of disease pathogenesis enabled by these gene discoveries. Finding therapies for pediatric cardiovascular disorders will be challenging because the biological targets are generally central to cell homeostasis (e.g., RAS/MAP kinase signaling) so cannot be completely inhibited for long periods without incurring side effects that would outweigh their benefits. For this R35 mechanism, I and my outstanding co- investigators with relevant expertise intend to address this gap using a drug development pipeline that begins with high-throughput screening to overcome pupal lethality in Drosophila melanogaster models of disease with a chemical library that covers druggable space (n=14,400) using 96-well plates and robotics. Screening in whole animals is performed agnostically and has the putative advantage of providing a simultaneous read out of efficacy and toxicity. We provide preliminary data showing that we have already achieved this using a fly RAF1 mutant model of Noonan syndrome with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Subsequent steps with fruit flies include confirmation of initial hits in vials, determining efficacy against adult fly phenotypes such as rough eye, ectopic wing veins and heart hypertrophy. Back-up libraries for the candidate compounds, typically 60-80 chemical neighbors, will be culled for ones with most desirable drug traits and then screened in the fly models. Using a defined set of fruit fly deficiency lines, targets and anti-targets will be established to enable further rounds of rational pharmacology. ADME studies will be used to reduce potential for drug-drug interactions. In parallel, we will pursue repurposing of FDA-approved drugs using library screening with fruit fly models and systems pharmacogenomics. Leading compounds and drugs will then be tested against phenotypes in human induced pluripotent stem cell lines with the disease-causing mutation for efficacy. The most promising drugs will then be tested in existing mouse models (e.g., HCM in Raf1 mutant mice) using appropriate endpoints. Taken as a whole, the approach proposed will significantly advance the identification of novel therapeutics for pediatric cardiovascular diseases, starting with the RASopathies and later for other traits. If robust, this will provide a paradigm that can be adopted for other genetic traits of interest to the NHLBI.',\n",
       " 'Impact of Sugars and Human Milk Oligosaccharides on Infant Microbiome and Obesity Abstract Hispanic children are at high risk for obesity, a disparity that is already established by 2 years of age. Our prior work found that high dietary sugars in early-life contributes to this increased risk and that this adverse effect was obliterated in children who were exposed to extended (not exclusive) breastfeeding for >12 months. Thus, sugars and extended breastfeeding exert opposing effects on early obesity-risk, but the mechanisms are unclear. One way that dietary sugars and extended breastfeeding could impact infants? obesity-risk is by affecting gut microbiome development, which is rapidly evolving during the first 24 months of life. This is a plausible mechanism given that the gut microbiome is implicated in the development of obesity, and that gut microbial changes have been documented in response to dietary sugars and factors in breast milk. One factor in breast milk that may be directly relevant is the mixture of different human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which reach the colon intact and serve as prebiotics, shaping the diversity of the gut microbiota. Therefore, the effects of HMOs on microbiome development could be one mechanism by which breastfeeding protects against obesity in infants, a novel concept supported by our preliminary data. Exposure to high dietary sugars in infancy could also impact obesity risk by disrupting cognitive function and appetite regulation, and evidence suggests that these effects might also be mediated by the gut microbiome, and that HMOs, can protect against these impairments, but human studies are lacking. We propose to examine these concepts in a cohort study in 240 Hispanic women and their newborn infants. Participants will be followed from birth to 24 months, with frequent sampling and assessment of breast milk for HMO composition, maternal and infant microbiota, maternal and infant diet, and infant eating behaviors. The primary outcome will be infant body fat by DEXA and secondary outcomes will be infant cognition and appetite regulation, including gut-derived appetite hormones in a sub-set. We have 4 Specific Aims: 1) Determine the joint effects of dietary sugars and HMOs on development of the infant gut microbiome; 2) Determine the joint effects of dietary sugars and HMOs on development of infant body fat.; 3) Determine the joint effects of dietary sugars and HMOs on infant cognitive outcomes, eating behavior and appetite regulation; and 4) Determine whether the effects of dietary sugars and HMOs on infant outcomes are mediated by changes in the gut microbiome. This study will move the field forward by identifying how early-life dietary exposures (focusing on dietary sugars, breastfeeding and HMOs) affect gut microbiome development, and how this affects development of obesity, cognition and appetite regulation. Findings are expected to have significant implications for identifying specific HMOs and/or gut microbial changes that will be protective for obesity and inform future novel intervention modalities applicable to Hispanic women and their infants.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary In the US, one in seven adults has type 2 diabetes (T2D), and if current trends continue, it is projected that T2D prevalence can rise to as high as one in three adults by the year 2050. Furthermore, the burden of this health condition disproportionately affects US ethnic minorities; whereas the current T2D prevalence is 11% among Whites, it is 22% among Blacks and Hispanics. Obesity is a strong risk factor for T2D and part of this effect is hypothesized to be due to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the extent to which adiposity acts on the development of T2D through liver fat is unknown. Current race/ethnic-specific guidelines for the identification of obesity using body anthropometry (e.g. body mass index) are established for White and Asian populations. However, race/ethnic-specific guidelines are lacking for US Black and Hispanic populations, primarily because evidence has been limited to findings from cross-sectional studies. We propose to test the hypothesis that the obesity-T2D relationship will be evident at different clinically relevant anthropometric values among Blacks and Hispanics compared to Whites. In addition, we propose to estimate the mediating effect of liver fat on the association between anthropometry and T2D. The proposed investigation leverages the rich longitudinal data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a cohort study of 6,814 White, Black, Hispanic and Chinese adults that have been followed since the year 2000. Baseline data will identify obesity using several anthropometric measures, and to identify the degree of fatty liver using Computed Tomography scans. Individuals were followed for incident T2D in four subsequent follow-up exam visits. Proportional hazards regression will be used to estimate race-specific associations between anthropometry and incident T2D; multivariable linear regression analyses will be used to evaluate race- specific associations between anthropometric measurements and liver fat at baseline; and we will use inverse probability weighted proportional hazards regression to estimate the mediating effect of obesity on T2D through liver fat. Prior studies of the association of anthropometric measures and T2D in Black and Hispanic populations were limited by their cross-sectional study design, or lacked multi-ethnic groups to evaluate heterogeneity of the T2D risk between race/ethnic groups. In contrast, our proposal is innovative by evaluating this association in a large, well-characterized prospective cohort of multi-racial/ethnic groups. The significance of the proposal is reflected in the much higher prevalence of T2D in the understudied Black and Hispanic populations. The interdisciplinary training environment, expert mentorship in the fields of obesity and T2D epidemiology, health disparities and epidemiologic methods, will provide the applicant a platform in which he can strengthen his training goals and contribute to the field of chronic disease as a future independent researcher in T2D prevention epidemiology. !',\n",
       " 'Abstract Cardiovascular disease remains the single greatest cause of mortality in America. In those aged 65 or older, cardiovascular disease accounts for a proportionally greater mortality rate than other age groups. Changes in cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling, particularly a prolonged Ca2+ signal resulting in a prolonged relaxation time, can cause age-dependent cardiac dysfunction. Work showing increased left ventricular filling pressures and volumes with age provides evidence that cardiomyocytes in aged hearts bear greater longitudinal stretch than their young counterparts. My sponsor?s laboratory has novel data showing age-dependent upregulation of the stretch- activated cation channel Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) in the aged myocardium. Using Young (3-4 month) and Aged (24-26 month) mice in combination with genetic (inducible cardiac-specific TRPV4 overexpression) and pharmacologic (TRPV4 inhibition) approaches, this proposal tests the central hypothesis that mechanical stretch activates TRPV4 in cardiomyocytes of the aged heart, leading to enhanced ECC and impaired diastolic relaxation. Aim 1 investigates the role of TRPV4 in stretch-induced Ca2+ homeostasis at the isolated cell level. Cardiomyocytes of Young and Aged mice will be subjected to physiologic, longitudinal stretch while measuring sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry (Mn2+ quench of fura-2), sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ loading (fluo-5F, with caffeine application), spontaneous ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ release events (fluo-4), and simultaneous ratiometric Ca2+ (fura-2) and force during electric field stimulation. Aim 2 extends methodology to the level of the whole organ, as isolated hearts of Young and Aged mice will be subjected to increases in preload to examine pressure development. Transgenic mice expressing the GCaMP6f Ca2+ sensor in cardiomyocytes will be utilized to examine cardiomyocyte Ca2+ dynamics in response to elevations in preload. This proposal evaluates TRPV4 as a novel target for therapeutic modulation of cardiomyocyte Ca2+ homeostasis in the aged heart. Furthermore, this proposal will give the applicant valuable training and perspective, and serve as a foundation for a future career in cardiovascular research.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY    Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive form of lung cancer, with a median survival of 24  months and a five year overall survival of 7%. Cisplatin based chemotherapy is the first line treatment for SCLC,  functioning  by  creating  DNA  crosslinks  leading  to  cancer  cell  death.  While  initially  effective,  many  patients  ultimately develop cisplatin resistance and experience tumor recurrence. The DNA damage response (DDR) is  a signaling network that recognizes challenges to genome integrity and coordinates diverse DNA repair and cell  cycle  checkpoint  pathways.  Targeting  DDR  proteins  critical  to  the  cellular  response  to  cisplatin  in  SCLC  may  overcome  acquired  cisplatin  resistance,  but  the  cellular  response  to  cisplatin  remains  unclear  because  many  proteins  that  respond  to  cisplatin induced  DNA  damage  have  yet  to  be  identified.  To  address  this  issue,  a  synthetic lethal screen using a custom siRNA library of 1008 nuclear enzymes was performed in H128 cisplatin  resistant SCLC cells to identify genes critical for mediating cisplatin resistance. Enhancer Of Zeste 2 Polycomb  Repressive  Complex  2  Subunit  (EZH2),  a  H3  K27  methyltransferase,  was  identified  as  one  of  the  strongest  synthetic lethal hits in the screen, where knockdown of EZH2 strongly sensitized H128 cells to cisplatin.   EZH2 is overexpressed in SCLC as well as other cancers and has been implicated in cancer progression.  Moreover, EZH2 inhibitors have shown efficacy in several cancers, including SCLC;? however, the the molecular  underpinnings  of  the  efficacy  of  EZH2  depletion  or  inhibition  in  SCLC  and  the  mechanistic  role  of  EZH2  in  mediating cisplatin resistance in SCLC are unclear. In this regard, I validated that EZH2 depletion in cisplatin  resistant H128 and H146 SCLC cell lines results in cisplatin hypersensitivity, and furthermore found that EZH2  localizes to DNA damage sites induced by laser microirradiation, suggesting that EZH2 may function directly in  mediating  DNA  damage  resistance  in  SCLC.  In  addition,  using  mass  spectrometry  analysis  of  purified  EZH2  from cells, I identified a novel interaction between EZH2 and DNA Damage Binding Protein 1 (DDB1), an E3  ubiquitin ligase component that promotes nucleotide excision repair (NER) of cisplatin induced DNA intrastrand  crosslinks, which I validated by co immunoprecipitation. As such, I hypothesize that EZH2 plays a critical role in  mediating cisplatin resistance in SCLC by promoting DNA damage response (DDR) activities and furthermore  that EZH2 inhibition will sensitize resistant SCLC cells and tumors with dysregulated DDR pathways to cisplatin  treatment. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism by which EZH2 mediates cisplatin resistance in SCLC. Aim 2 will  determine  if  EZH2  inhibition  sensitizes  resistant  SCLC  cells  and  tumors  with  dysregulated  DDR  protein  expression to cisplatin treatment in vitro and in vivo. Completion of these aims will define a novel role for EZH2  in  the  DDR  in  mediating  cisplatin  resistance  in  SCLC  and  elucidate  the  effectiveness  and  specific  biological  context  for  which  EZH2  can  function  as  a  novel  therapeutic  target  for  improving  the  efficacy  of  treatment  for  patients with SCLC who fail initial treatment.

       " 'The period from adolescence to emerging adulthood is characterized by multiple developmental transitions and peak incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Hispanic and African-American women are at high risk for HPV-associated and other sexually transmitted diseases, including cervical cancer and Chlamydia. Subsequent to the approval and release of the quadrivalent (Gardasil) HPV vaccine in 2007, we initiated a prospective cohort study of sexually-active, inner-city, minority women (aged 12-19) attending the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (MSAHC), the largest comprehensive adolescent primary care facility in the U.S. We observed higher rates of HPV infection and associated cervical cytological abnormalities post-vaccination among subjects immunized at age 15 or older who took ?12 months (vs. <12 months) to complete the 3-dose vaccine schedule. Furthermore, we found evidence for increased risk of cervical infection with HPV vaccine types and other STIs among subjects with a history of exposure to psycho-social risk indicators reflecting family disadvantage, psychological distress, and history of childhood abuse/neglect. Last year, the FDA approved a new 9-valent HPV vaccine with a reduced dosing schedule for younger adolescents based on evidence from short term bridging studies of primarily Caucasian and low-risk women with limited numbers of sexual partners. This study will assess the real-world effectiveness of the new vaccine in a high-risk minority population. This unique study cohort also provides opportunities to explore new and innovative areas of research relevant to adolescent health in women, especially with respect to other STIs, and the cervicovaginal microbiome. This is of particular relevance since STI rates are high in this population, with a third acquiring Chlamydia. In addition, we observed that certain types of bacteria found in the cervical specimens from women in our study were associated with increased risks of Chlamydia and HPV infection. Furthermore we hypothesize that the impact of chronic stress and risky behaviors leading to STIs and breakthrough HPV infections may be influenced in part by changes in the cervicovaginal microbiome. To address these health disparities in minority young women, we are proposing to expand our existing cohort and recruit an additional 1108 women with prospective follow-up to age 30 to: 1) determine whether there is a reduction in the incidence of cervical, anal and oral HPV infection and incidence of cervical cytological abnormalities among 9-valent versus quadrivalent HPV vaccinees; 2) study the association between cervicovaginal microbiome and risk of HPV and STIs; and 3) assess the complex associations between psycho-social factors including history of childhood abuse/neglect and risk of HPV and STIs. Data obtained from this study will be essential to understanding the long-term impacts of HPV vaccination in high-risk, minority women not studied in the vaccine trials, and will provide the biological underpinnings for future screening practices, as well as estimating the potential impact of the cervicovaginal microbiome and psycho-social factors on risk of HPV and STIs.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry).',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gammaherpesvirus that causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with B cell and epithelial cell cancers. EBV is an enveloped virus and therefore requires the fusion of the viral and cellular membrane to infect cells. The specificity of cell infection and membrane fusion triggered by the virus is for B cell entry is governed by four viral glycoproteins (gH, gL, gB and gp42), whereas EBV entry into epithelial cells requires three viral glycoproteins (gH, gL, and gB). The gB protein is thought to play the primary role in mediating membrane fusion, receiving activating signals from the other proteins after receptor binding to cells. The gH and gL proteins form a complex that also associates with gp42, and this three-way complex is necessary for binding receptors on B cells and triggering their infection. However, for epithelial cells, gHgL interacts directly with EphA2 triggering EBV membrane fusion and entry, presumably by activating gB. These triggering complexes of gHgL and cellular receptors are critically important for initiating EBV infection, but little is known about their structure and mechanism of action. In this proposal, the Jardetzky, Longnecker, and Zhou research groups will collaborate on studies of the architecture and mechanism of EBV epithelial cell triggering complexes, to gain greater insight into herpesvirus entry into cells. These studies may reveal general features of herpesvirus-mediated membrane fusion and open new possibilities for antiviral or vaccine development.',\n",
       " '1  Project Abstract: Although the number of people developing breast cancer (BC) each year has remained the  2  same, 5 year survival rates for late stage disease are still an abysmal 17 26%. However, one positive indicator  3  of survival is how well the patient?s immune system is able to recognize the tumor and attack it, using immune   4  cells  like  tumor associated  macrophages  (TAMs).  Basal like,  triple  negative  BC  (TNBC)  is  a  uniquely  deadly  5  type of BC and accounts for about 20% of BC cases. TNBC does not grow because of hormone and growth  6  factors, but instead frequently activates other pro growth signals like the expression of secreted WNT proteins  7  that act as messengers to nearby cells. In addition, TNBC is more likely to manipulate the immune system into   8  a  tumor promoting  mechanism  instead  of  a  tumor fighting  one.  This  is  accomplished  by  inducing  TAMs  to  9  program into a tumor promoting M2 state, which helps create an environment for tumors to thrive by promoting  10  blood vessel growth, instead of a tumor fighting M1 state. We have identified the DEK protein as a key driver of  11  BC growth and disease progression. DEK is highly expressed ? meaning too much protein is made compared  12  to  normal  cells     in  about  60%  of  all  breast  cancers,  especially  TNBC.  DEK  is  over expressed  in  all  types  of  13  cancer studied so far, meaning that understanding how DEK functions to promote cancer growth and disease  14  progression could have a far reaching impact in understanding cancer biology. We have previously used cultured  15  cells to discover that DEK promotes the proliferation of cancer cells by increasing the expression of several WNT  16  genes that then get secreted to act on neighboring cells, but have not yet investigated this in animal models.  17  Interestingly, our preliminary data suggest that the WNT proteins produced by DEK expressing cancer cells may  18  signal  to  TAMs  to  enter  an  M2 like  state  to  further  promote  tumor  growth.  We  hypothesize  that  DEK  over  19  expression  in  BC  promotes  tumor  formation  via  elevated  WNT  expression,  which  acts  both  on  neighboring  20  epithelial cells and on macrophages. We will use three dimensional cell culture of human cells, patient samples,  21  and new mouse models of BC to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will use a new DEK over expression model  22  in  the  mammary  epithelium  of  mice  to  Determine  when  and  how  DEK  promotes  tumor  growth.  We  will  also  23  determine the necessity for continued DEK expression to maintain tumor growth, which will inform the feasibility  24  of creating DEK targeting therapies in the future. Aim 2 will investigate how important WNT proteins are for the  25  ability of DEK to promote tumor growth and progression. Finally, Aim 3 will examine how DEK and WNT proteins  26  work together to induce TAMs to enter the tumor promoting M2 state. This work will be the first to both investigate  27  the consequences of DEK over expression in an animal model and the first to examine the ability of WNT proteins  28  to signal to the immune system during cancer development and progression. Understanding how DEK promotes  29  tumor growth, including downstream effects on TAMs, will better inform therapeutic decisions that maximize  30  the collaboration between chemotherapy and the anti ?tumor immune response.

       " 'The prognosis for pancreatic cancer patients remains dismal. Effective therapy is clearly an unmet medical need for these patients. Aside from surgery which benefits a small fraction of patients, current standard treatment consists of strong chemotherapy that is highly toxic and with less than 50% chance of working. For those who initially benefit from chemotherapy, rapid progression is inevitable. The promise of immunotherapy, while already realized in other cancer types, has failed to show benefit for pancreatic cancer patients. Therapeutic breakthrough must therefore come from novel discoveries in the biology of pancreatic cancer. We now recently found, for the first time in literature, that pancreatic cancer cells ?armored? themselves by activating the innate immunity, a self-defense mechanism that is usually summoned when cells are injured or invaded by microorganisms. In doing so pancreatic cancer cells become highly aggressive and resistant to chemotherapeutics. Our approach is to ?deactivate? such defense mechanism in pancreatic cancer cells by inhibiting Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase 4 (IRAK4), the master switch that controls the innate immune pathway. By doing so we found that pancreatic cancer cells become greatly weakened and are much more vulnerable to chemotherapy. On this premise we have now made further potentially impactful findings that we plan to confirm and pursue in the following three aims:  1. Aim 1: We found that presence of IRAK4 is essential for supporting transformed growth and cellular  signaling driven by oncogenic KRAS, a genetic event that is present in almost all pancreatic cancer. We  will explore the mechanistic detail and determine whether loss of IRAK4 will impede KRAS-driven  pancreatic tumorigenesis using human pancreatic cancer cell lines and state-of-the-art genetic mouse  models. If shown to be true, these results could have impact on other KRAS-mutant cancer types.  2. Aim 2: We have generated an IRAK4-deficient pancreatic cancer mouse model that we plan to  characterize to understand the consequence of global IRAK4 loss, as will happen with pharmacologic  inhibition, in pancreatic cancer progression. In addition, we will specifically study the role of immune  IRAK4 in pancreatic cancer growth, which will yield clinically useful information if IRAK4 inhibitors are  advanced into clinical trials in the future.  3. Aim 3: Our preliminary data shows that IRAK4 inhibition renders immunotherapy effective in genetic  mouse model. In this aim we will test two novel, highly potent IRAK4 inhibitors, with the ultimate goal of  translating these findings into clinical trials.',\n",
       " \"Adolescence is the period between childhood and adulthood during which cognitive, emotional, and social behaviors develop substantially. As such, adolescence is a period of both opportunity and vulnerability, and mental illness onset typically occurs during adolescence. The factors mediating a successful transition through adolescence range from social to biological. One factor that has received increased investigation in recent years is the timing of puberty. Whether individuals undergo pubertal development early or late relative to their peers increases risk for mental illness. Scientific explanations of the relationship between pubertal timing and mental illness tend to focus on the social and emotional consequences of developing earlier or later than one's peers. However, these models do not consider the role gonadal steroid hormones play in shaping the developing nervous system and behavior. We've proposed that nervous system sensitivity to gonadal steroid hormones decreases across adolescent development. In this framework, the developing adolescent brain is a moving target for the effects of gonadal steroid hormones, and shifts in pubertal timing may alter the course of brain development toward increased vulnerability. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that sensitivity to the organizing actions of gonadal steroid hormones decreases across postnatal development. This hypothesis predicts that adult behavioral outcomes will differ between groups receiving steroid hormone treatments before, during or after the normal time of puberty. Our strategy will be to vary the postnatal age at which rats are exposed to an 18-day period of testosterone (males) or estradiol (females) and then assess anhedonia, working memory, anxiety, and social behavior in adulthood (following hormone replacement). The results of this study will advance our understanding of the neurobiological principles governing adolescent brain development in both males and females. Furthermore, this work will have implications for sex-biased psychopathologies associated with deviations in pubertal timing such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary Building on a T90-supported training experience working jointly with scientists in Dentistry and Biostatistics, this project aims to develop new techniques for modeling dental outcome data by drawing on modern data-science techniques for spatially structured data, specifically accounting for both adjacent-tooth and cross-mouth patterns of association. An investigation into alternative possible mechanisms for oral-health consequences of methamphetamine use serves as a motivating example. A recurring narrative in both the clinical literature and media reports has been the frequent presentation of rampant dental disease in habitual methamphetamine (meth) users, a condition described colloquially as ?meth mouth?. The proposed mechanisms for the increased dental disease are the ?contaminant theory?, where corrosive elements are released when meth is smoked inducing acid-mediated erosion of tooth enamel, and a lack of proper oral health behaviors (OHBs) over extended periods of time. Because both theories explain basic features of available data, a more refined data-science framework is needed to help distinguish these alternatives, achieved here by characterizing in greater detail the patterns of association that would be expected under the respective theories. Tests of alternative models can be based on available data from a sample of 571 meth users. Oral-health outcomes were collected following protocols used in the population-based National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), with additional data also collected on meth-use history and other attributes known to be linked to dental disease. Evidence from preliminary investigations of dental caries data points not only to strong spatial patterns of association between adjacent teeth but also to substantial association between corresponding teeth on opposite sides of the mouth. Conditionally autoregressive statistical models for spatial data are in widespread use, but methods for accommodating multiple spatial neighbor relationships have only recently been conceptualized, giving rise to an interdisciplinary research opportunity for statistical-methods development applicable to dental-outcome data. To address missing teeth, the project will also seek to build on techniques in the literature on statistical analysis with incomplete data, in particular with an approach accounting for alternative mechanisms that could explain why teeth are missing. Consistent with the goals of the NIDCR 2014-2019 Strategic Plan, it is anticipated that the proposed methodologies will be applicable to a wide variety of oral-health (and other health-science) research settings.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu enhances viral infectivity by modulating several host cell proteins that are detrimental to the virus, including CD4 and BST-2 (tetherin), and preventing them from being incorporated into viral particles. Importantly, Vpu activities result in the protection of HIV-1 infected cells from cellular immune responses such as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). For this reason, inhibitors of Vpu activity could be used to enhance immune killing of HIV infected cells in patients. This type of inhibitor could be an important component of therapies aimed at eliminating reservoirs of HIV infected cells.  The Johnson lab serendipitously discovered that Vpu targets the viral glycoprotein from Gibbon ape Leukemia Virus (GaLV Env) and prevents it from being incorporated into HIV-1 viral particles. Therefore, inhibiting Vpu activity greatly enhances infectivity when HIV-1 is used with this glycoprotein. GaLV Env was selected as a surrogate Vpu target in an assay for identifying inhibitors of Vpu activity. Unlike other types of Vpu assays, the output (infectivity) is quantitative in nature and very amenable to a high throughput screening.  Along with collaborators at Southern Research Institute (SRI, see letter of support), a large high throughput screening (HTS) campaign of over 650,000 compounds was initiated using this assay in hopes of finding appropriate Vpu inhibitors that could be advanced to clinical applications. This screen and dose response validation of the hits was completed in August 2017 and identified 205 candidate Vpu-inhibiting compounds.  The ultimate goal of this project is develop compounds that can be used to block Vpu activity in a clinical setting. The objective of this proposal is to determine which compounds from the HTS campaign are most suitable for further development as clinical Vpu inhibitors. 1.

Screen for compounds that directly bind to Vpu.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies to nucleic acids and to proteins with which they associate. Signaling through the nucleic acid sensing TLR, TLR7 and TLR9, is critical in SLE pathogenesis, and dysregulated TLR signaling can promote lupus in humans and in mouse models. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and B cells both express these nucleic acid sensing TLR and are important in SLE pathogenesis. Autoreactive B cells produce pathogenic autoantibodies in SLE, and B cell antibody production is promoted by TLR7 and TLR9 signaling. pDC use TLR7 and TLR9 to respond to nucleic acids in immune complexes resulting in the secretion of large quantities of type I IFN cytokines, which have pleiotropic effects on the immune response, including enhancing dendritic cell (DC) maturation, plasma cell formation, and T cell responses, all of which can promote a feed forward loop of immune activation. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which TLR7 and TLR9 signaling are regulated in these two critical cell types is important for understanding the pathogenesis of SLE and in defining therapeutic targets for this disease. We have made the novel discovery that the signaling adapter BCAP is highly expressed in pDC and is required for type I IFN production in response to TLR7 and TLR9 agonists from these cells. We also show for the first time that BCAP has a role in B cell TLR7 and TLR9 responses, and that loss of BCAP ameliorates disease development in a mouse model of lupus. Thus, BCAP is a key regulator of TLR7 and TLR9 function in pDC and B cells, and understanding how BCAP regulates TLR7/9 signaling in these cells will help identify new therapeutic targets in lupus and other IFN-associated autoimmune diseases. In aim 1, we will determine how BCAP regulates TLR7/9 responses in pDC and B cells, with a focus on mechanistic work and translation. In aim 2, we will determine the relative contribution of BCAP in pDC and B cells to the development of SLE using 2 mouse models, TLR7.1 mice and B6.Sle1.Yaa mice. Understanding the role of BCAP in pDC and B cell TLR7/9 responses will give us insights into lupus pathogenesis and allow us to evaluate BCAP as a therapeutic target in SLE.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background/Rationale:  People with serious mental illness (SMI) die, on average, many years prematurely, with rates of premature mortality 2 to 3 times greater than the general population. Over 60% of premature deaths in this population are due to natural causes, especially poorly treated cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious diseases. Although the VA is a centrally organized, comprehensive healthcare system, veterans with SMI still have difficulty navigating the system, and are at substantially elevated risk for premature death. Too often, they do not attend scheduled appointments or fail to engage in primary care treatment, and consequently do not get valuable preventive and primary care services.  Primary care in VA has undergone significant transformation under the Patent Aligned Care Team (PACT) model, which is based on the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) concept. PACT has the goal of improving the quality, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of primary care. But it remains unclear how PACT will impact the large populations of veterans who get the majority of their care in specialty settings, such as people with SMI. Research can inform efforts to apply the PACT model in specialty settings. For example, while people with SMI do poorly with usual primary care arrangements, there is now substantial evidence that integrated care and medical care management approaches can improve medical treatment and outcomes, and reduce treatment costs, in people with SMI. Objective:  Using available evidence, we propose to implement and evaluate a specialized PACT model that meets the needs of individuals with SMI (SMI-PACT). Methods:  This project will partner with leadership at one medical center to implement SMI-PACT, with the goal of improving healthcare and outcomes among people with SMI, while reducing unnecessary use of emergency and hospital services. Evidence-based quality improvement strategies will be used to reorganize processes of care. In a site-level controlled trial, this project will evaluate the effect, relative to usual care, of SMI-PACT implementation on (a) provision of appropriate preventive and medical treatments; (b) patient health-related quality of life and satisfaction with care; and (c) medical and mental health treatment utilization and costs. The project includes a mixed methods formative evaluation of usual care and SMI-PACT implementation to strengthen the intervention, and assess barriers and facilitators to its implementation. Mixed methods will also be used to investigate the relationships between organizational context, intervention factors, and patient and provider outcomes; and identify patient factors related to successful patient outcomes. Significance:  This project's approach to SMI-PACT is consistent with the VA PACT model, and with efforts in VA to improve care for veterans with psychiatric disorders. This will be one of the first projects to systematically implement and evaluate the PCMH and PACT concepts beyond primary care. Should SMI-PACT be demonstrated to be feasible and effective, the model could be used more broadly to improve the quality and efficiency of care for veterans with serious mental illness. Findings regarding PACT in specialty mental health may also inform efforts to improve care in other specialty healthcare settings.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are undoubtedly a major public health concern and a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Among the arboviruses, mosquito-borne viruses collectively constitute some of the most important human pathogens. Recently, we have observed significant expansions in their geographic distribution, substantial increases in their virulence, and their adaptation to new vectors that have now increased transmission rates to humans. The importance of these viruses is further underscored by the lack of available vaccines, therapeutics, or reliable measures that can be implemented to diminish disease. Recently, arbovirologists have become increasingly interested in the discovery and characterization of novel insect-specific viruses, in particular, mosquito-specific flaviviruses. Unlike the much better known mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses, which alternately infect vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, mosquito-specific flaviviruses appear to replicate only in mosquitoes and mosquito cells. A large number of insect-specific flaviviruses has been isolated from and/or detected in mosquitoes and sandflies collected worldwide, with very high prevalence rates among affected populations. Although these insect-specific flaviviruses are abundant in nature, very little is known about their ecological niche, their role in the evolutionary history of flaviviruses, the genetic determinants that render them unable to replicate in vertebrate cells, or to what extent they affect transmission of vertebrate-pathogenic flaviviruses in nature. Several studies have demonstrated that these viruses are mosquito-specific using conventional virologic techniques, but there are currently no data that describe their lack of replication in vertebrate cells at a cellular or molecular level, and no work has been attempted to determine exactly where the restriction to replication in vertebrate cells exist for these flaviviruses. Additionally, very few studies with conflicting results have been performed to determine the effect of mosquito- specific flaviviruses on their vertebrate-pathogenic flavivirus relatives, and no work has been done to identify the mechanism by which superinfection exclusion occurs among these viruses. This project will utilize a recently discovered insect-specific flavivirus (tentatively designated Aripo virus; ARPV) that is evolutionarily closely related to the vertebrate-pathogenic flaviviruses, as a prototype, to achieve the following aims: (1) to determine at what stage of the virus? replication cycle is ARPV restricted from replicating in vertebrate cells, and (2) to identify the mechanism by which ARPV precludes superinfection by vertebrate-pathogenic flaviviruses in mosquitoes. This study will utilize a wide array of techniques to determine if ARPV is restricted from replication in vertebrate cells because of an inability to attach and enter, replicate and/or translate its genome, or correctly assemble and release its progeny virions. We will also determine how ARPV affects the RNAi pathways in vitro and in vivo, and identify which components are responsible for preventing the subsequent superinfection by vertebrate-pathogenic flaviviruses, in a medically important vector species. Altogether, the results obtained from this project will be instrumental in understanding flavivirus biology, and will be readily translated to design new therapeutic targets, attenuate flaviviruses for novel vaccine approaches, and design biological control measures for important vectors through the use of mosquito-specific viruses or activation of key components in the RNAi pathway to prevent subsequent flavivirus infection. My most recent work involves the isolation and characterization of a novel insect-specific flavivirus, named Aripo virus (ARPV) that was isolated from mosquitoes collected in Trinidad. The complete ARPV genome was determined and phylogenetic analyses showed that ARPV is closely related to the pathogenic mosquito-borne flaviviruses. My work also shows that prior infection with ARPV reduces superinfection and dissemination rates of West Nile virus in vivo in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Experimentally, ARPV infection is also efficiently transmitted vertically in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, at least to the F3 generation. There is currently no work being undertaken to determine exactly where the restriction to replication in vertebrate cells exist for these insect- specific flaviviruses, and no work aimed at identifying the mechanism by which superinfection exclusion occurs between insect-specific and pathogenic flaviviruses. These new avenues of research involving flavivirus host restriction and mosquito innate immunity will form the foundation of my future research as I transition into an independent position. My preliminary work shows ARPV can attach and enter, and replicate and translate its genomic material in vertebrate cells, clearly demonstrating this is a productive line of research. Extensive theoretical and practical training in new experimental techniques are required to effectively complete my aims and successfully transition to an independent faculty. UTMB offers a vast plethora of opportunities including training in lab and project management, manuscript and grant writing, and mentoring and communication. UTMB contains renowned arbovirologists, RNA biologists, faculty mentoring programs, core facilities and many intramural funding options that will effectively guide and support my transition toward independent investigator status. This award will provide financial support and protected time to generate high quality data for R grant submissions. This award will support my long-term goal of leading an effective arbovirus research team.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal from the Johns Hopkins University is to continue as the Scientific Data Research Center (SDRC) of the Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium (GpCRC) to support the clinical centers as they continue to gather biospecimens and data for patients with gastroparesis and related disorders in the Gastroparesis Registry 2 and future treatment trials. In addition, the SDRC will support the Pathological Basis of Gastroparesis Study conducted by Dr. Farrugia at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN for identification of the molecular factors involved in pathogenesis of gastroparesis. The goal of the GpCRC sponsored by the NIDDK since 2006 is to focus on the etiology, treatment strategies, and clinical course of gastroparesis that will provide the basis for understanding the natural history and developing means of better diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management of patients with gastroparesis.  In the next phase of the GpCRC, the studies initiated during the previous funding cycle will be completed, and new therapeutic trials will be initiated. The SDRC will provide the GpCRC with leadership, expertise in biostatistical analysis, study design, data management, multicenter coordination, quality assurance, project support, communication and organization, and will be responsible for supporting all future protocol development or modifications, including providing sample size calculations, statistical advice, development of questionnaires, and data analysis. The SDRC will support development, implementation, and maintenance of a database of clinical information and a digital repository for autonomic function, wireless motility capsule, and scintigraphy studies. The SDRC will work with the centers and the NIDDK Repository to track and maintain an inventory of all biospecimens obtained. The SDRC will develop or modify any data monitoring plans, support manuscript preparation, and coordinate the activities and meetings of the Steering Committee (SC). The SDRC will prepare or modify protocols for submission to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and the SC for their approval prior to the implementation of any study protocols or protocol changes. The SDRC will be responsible for preparation of documents for submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) applications on behalf of the GpCRC. The SDRC will prepare all reports including data reports for review by the DSMB at their meetings. The SDRC will be responsible for acquiring and administering subcontracts as needed. The SDRC and will continue to work with the NIDDK Biosample, Genetic, and Data Repositories, and the clinical centers to coordinate procedures for coding, shipping, processing, receipt, and storage of study samples that are to be maintained in the Repositories.  The GpCRC is poised to continue to have major impact on the field and directly advance the mission of the National Institutes of Health to improve the health of the public.',\n",
       " \"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is clinically used to treat hemodynamic instability and O2 carrying deficits in patients with acute blood loss, and patients with chronic anemia caused by bone marrow failure/suppression (1-4). Currently, cold storage of human RBCs (hRBCs) can preserve hRBCs for a maximum of six weeks (i.e. 42 days) (5). This relatively short ex vivo storage length has been set by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) based on the post transfusion viability (PTV) of stored hRBCs at 24 hours, which must be greater than or equal to 75 Â± 9% (7) and the percent hemolysis of stored hRBCs which must be less than 1% (8). Despite widespread clinical use, stored RBCs face two major problems, namely: the steadily decreasing supply of RBC units (1, 9, 10), and the questionable clinical safety of RBCs stored for extended periods of time (11-17). The supply of RBCs is expected to diminish as the population base ages and demand increases (1, 9, 10, 18). As stored RBCs age, they undergo biochemical and biophysical changes that are often referred to as the storage lesion (8, 19-24).  It is well known that upon transfusion of stored RBCs, there is a population of RBCs (i.e. healthy RBCs) that circulate for more than 24 hours, and another smaller population (i.e. damaged RBCs) that are cleared within 24 hours post transfusion (54). This population of cells destined to be cleared quickly can be higher than 25% in units stored for a mean of 30 days. Therefore, it could be clinically beneficial if the damaged RBCs in any unit of RBCs could be separated leaving a population of only healthy RBCs behind for transfusion. When a recipient is transfused with a dose of RBCs that overwhelms their circulatory system's ability to compensate for the increased intravascular volume, heart failure can ensue. This condition is known as Transfusion Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO). It is the second leading cause of death related to transfusion reported to the FDA (106). We hypothesize that reducing the amount of soon to be cleared RBCs from older units by 25% and fresher units by 15% will reduce the volume of transfused product, thereby reducing the risk of death from TACO. In fact, as the incidence of TACO is usually quite underestimated as it is often not appreciated as a transfusion reaction, and as the transfusion community has undertaken several large scale initiatives to reduce the incidence of the most common cause of death as reported to the FDA (transfusion related acute lung injury, TRALI), TACO will likely surpass TRALI as the leading cause of transfusion related mortality (52). Thus, taking steps to reduce the incidence of TACO will have far reaching benefits for many recipients of RBCs.  Utilizing technology that exploits the intrinsic magnetization of the deoxygenated form of Hb inside RBC's in an applied magnetic field, the Yazer, Chalmers and Zborowski laboratories (6) demonstrated that RBCs lose magnetization during storage, which indicates that the aged RBCs lose Hb during storage. Furthermore, Chalmers and Zborowski have demonstrated technology capable of exploiting the intrinsic magnetization of deoxygenated Hb to perform a bulk separation of RBCs based on Hb content (55, 56). In this application, we hypothesize that RBCs with higher Hb content (i.e. healthy RBCs) correlate with higher deformability and PTV versus RBCs with lower Hb content (i.e. damaged RBCs). To test this hypothesis, we propose to further develop and optimize our magnetic separation technology to fractionate aged RBCs into different sub-fractions based on Hb content and Hb magnetic susceptibility, Characterize the biophysical and biochemical properties of these different sub-fractions of stored RBCs during storage and transfuse these different sub-fractions into an animal model with antioxidant status similar to humans to assess their ability to reduce/prevent systemic hypertension and oxidative tissue injury, both side-effects of exposure to cell-free Hb. This work is significant, since new technology will be developed to facilitate bulk separation of RBCs without labelling the cells to make the resulting RBC unit safer for clinical use.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs; cutaneous basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas) are the most common malignancies in humans in the United States. They are the source of considerable morbidity and are a tremendous cost to the health care system. Current methods for their prevention have consisted primarily of sun and tanning bed avoidance and the regular use of sunscreens. Unfortunately, these measures have proven inadequate, and in contrast to most other malignancies, the incidence of NMSCs continues to increase. Two agents that show promise for the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancers are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), which inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzyme, and difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. In other organ systems, these agents have synergistic cancer chemopreventive activities. Because the skin is readily accessible, it may be possible to apply topical formulations of these agents for the chemoprevention of skin cancers without encountering the potential for systemic toxicity. We hypothesize that topical application of the COX inhibitor diclofenac and/or topical DFMO for 9 months is a safe and effective method of reversing biomarkers associated with the development of non-melanoma skin cancers in subjects at risk for their development and will prevent the onset of new actinic keratoses. To test our hypothesis, we plan to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 100 subjects with a history of basal cell and/or squamous cell skin cancer and at least 8 actinic keratoses. Patients will be randomized to receive: topical DFMO + placebo; placebo + topical diclofenac; topical DFMO + topical diclofenac; placebo + placebo. We will assess whether topical DFMO + topical diclofenac alters skin biomarkers focusing on prostaglandin E2, polyamines and ornithine decarboxylase, proliferation and apoptosis markers (Ki67, PCNA, cyclin D1, caspase 3, tunel assay, Bcl-2, Bax), and molecules in the Akt/ERK1/2 axis. Studies are planned to determine if treatment with topical DFMO and/or topical diclofenac is well-tolerated without signs of significant toxicity. We will also assess whether subjects randomized to topical diclofenac and/or topical DFMO develop over a 9 month period of time fewer new actinic keratoses than those who are placed on placebo. The ultimate goal of these studies will be to determine whether topical diclofenac and/or DFMO should be evaluated in a clinical trial for the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancers.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the research proposed is to facilitate the construction of organic molecules by exploring unconventional reagents for cross-coupling and exploiting the unique attributes of such reagents. This will be accomplished by employing a recently developed, paradigm-shifting approach to cross-coupling involving a dual catalytic cycle. The two cycles, a photoredox catalytic cycle and a cross-coupling cycle, working in concert, will facilitate a single electron transmetalation protocol, allowing cross-coupling under mild conditions and, with the appropriate ligand, high levels of enantioselectivity via stereoconvergent transformations.     In particular, methods to do so from inexpensive, bench-stable, commodity nonmetallic organic precursors will be sought. A process using such materials would be robust, cost-effective, and scalable, leading to a facile transition from the academic setting to a process development facility. Employing the dual catalytic systems that have proven effective in studies on the cross-coupling of organotrifluoroborates, the protocol will be extended to non-organometallic bulk source materials, namely hydrazines and sulfinate salts. Studies on these commodity materials will focus on practical methods of effecting radical formation under photoredox conditions and assessing their viability in being funneled into the base metal catalytic cycle. Organocatalysts and inexpensive inorganic materials will be explored as potential photocatalysts to enhance the sustainable profile of developed processes. Photoflow-based technologies and strategies will be examined as a means of enhancing scalability and effectivity. Diverse electrophilic coupling partners will be examined, and stereoconvergent processes will be developed to access enantioenriched alkyl substructures. This protocol will be transformative in enabling unprecedented C-C bond construction via cross-coupling from nonconventional, inexpensive coupling partners.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Conditions such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, developmental abnormalities of the skeleton, as well as malignancies, such as multiple myeloma and breast cancer metastases, all negatively affect the musculoskeletal system. These conditions affect the health of a sizable percentage of the US population and lead to significant disability and substantial health care costs, and there is an ongoing need to better understand their causes and to support the development of more effective and well-tolerated therapies. To address this need, we propose to establish and develop a thematic and multidisciplinary Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). The scientific theme of the CMDR is that molecular and genetic analysis of musculoskeletal diseases, and conditions that involve the skeleton as part of their disease process, will lead to a better understanding of their causes and will support development of novel therapies. Our approach to studying these conditions will take advantage of state-of-the-art approaches to analyze the genome and transcriptome, the genetic manipulation of cells and animals, and skeletal phenotyping. A key to the success of this approach will be to increase the number of investigators whose research is aligned with the scientific theme of the Center via development of junior investigators and recruitment of new and established investigators. We will establish the CMDR on a strong foundation of musculoskeletal research and implement an Organization and Management Plan to create a self-sustaining Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (Aim 1). We will also provide multidisciplinary development and unique research opportunities to young investigators and support them to the point of independence (Aim 2). Lastly, we will create diverse teams of productive investigators by providing access to effective and useful research cores that produce significant and long-lasting benefits to the research infrastructure of UAMS and its affiliated institutions (Aim 3). The Overall Center Organization and Management Plan includes the Administrative Core, three research cores, and four research projects, led by promising junior investigators. The Administrative Core will oversee establishment and operation of the center, the three research cores, and a faculty development plan. The integrated and interactive faculty development plan will include a formal mentoring program that will guide four junior investigators to independence. The CMDR research cores include a Genetic Models Core that will use cutting-edge approaches to genetically manipulate cells and mice, a Bone Histology and Imaging Core that will analyze mouse and human hard tissues, and a Bioinformatics Core that will analyze the large datasets generated by the molecular analyses of cells from mouse and human samples. Successful implementation of this Organization and Management Plan will in the long-term lead to a self-sustaining Center of Biomedical Research Excellence that will generate novel and important results leading to more effective therapies for a variety of conditions that involve the musculoskeletal system.',\n",
       " 'The Marshall University Imaging Core will support the imaging activities of five junior investigators and potential pilot investigators as part of the project titled Appalachian Center for Cellular transport in Obesity Related Disorders (ACCORD). The five junior investigators have identified abnormalities in cellular transport related to disease states which are particularly associated with obesity, including cancer, hypertension and skeletal malformations. With the long-range goal of minimizing the health impact of dysregulated transport, or even blocking or reversing processes related to these transport mechanisms, these researchers seek to develop molecular level descriptions, which will lead to an understanding of the transport mechanism and the mechanism by which external factors can affect transport. The Imaging Core will support the long-range goals of these investigators by providing visualization tools and techniques which will enable them to determine the relative numbers and distributions of the specific proteins they have determined are associated with transport anomalies in selected disease states. The principle imaging tool which will be applied for the visualization tasks is a Multiphoton Fluorescence Microscope, which will enable high resolution optical imaging of tagged proteins. The multiphoton capability increases the quality of optical imaging in tissue, and will be used in studies comparing normal and abnormal tissues. This imaging capability will be enhanced, for researchers developing suitable model systems, via the production of custom tagged proteins suitable for use in live cell imaging. Live cell imaging will provide the opportunity to observe changes in protein concentrations and/or distributions within a cell occurring in response to a physiologically relevant cue or resulting from introduction of a pharmacological agent. Techniques enabled by fluorescent protein tagging, including FRET (fluorescence resonant energy transfer) and FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) may be employed to test developing hypotheses of protein transport mechanisms and their anomalies. Additional capabilities, including single molecule fluorescence imaging and atomic force microscopy will be available for addressing evolving project requirements.',\n",
       " 'Along with one of the highest rates of obesity in the country, hypertension, frequently associated with obesity, is highest in West Virginia, occurring in 41% of adults. Important in the pathogenesis of hypertension is altered handling of salt by the kidney. It appears that tight junctions (TJ) have an important role in our body?s handling of salts. In the kidney, the molecular composition of TJ determines the permeability and ion selectivity of different nephron segments. In particular, the TJ in the proximal tubular segment are quite permeable to Na+ and more ?leaky? than TJ in the distal tubular segment. These differences in permeability are consequences of the specific expression of different claudin isoforms. While proximal tubules express claudin 2, distal nephrons have claudin 4 as their major claudin isoform. Interestingly, changes in claudin expression are noted in renal tubules from salt- sensitive hypertensive animals. Consistently, knockout of claudin 4 causes hypotension. Clearly, properly controlled expression of claudins is essential for the intact animal to express maximal natriuresis, and impairment of this regulatory process contributes to salt-sensitive hypertension. However, little is known about what controls the composition of TJ along the nephron. Preliminary studies have shown that the signaling function of Na/K- ATPase (NKA) is a key to this regulation, and thus a key to paracellular selectivity and permeability in renal epithelial cells. The signaling NKA works through the activation of Src, feed forward amplification of ROS (reactive oxygen species), and downstream regulation of other protein and lipid kinase pathways. We have also learned that NKA and Src are highly expressed, and form a protein complex in renal epithelial cells. Moreover, we have demonstrated a dysregulation of this pathway in animal models of obesity and hypertension. On this scientific premise, we propose to test our central hypothesis that NKA regulates the selective permeability of TJ by altering the expression of claudins through its interaction with Src. We further contend that this NKA-mediated regulation is altered in salt-sensitive hypertension, resulting in changes in TJ structure and function in renal tubules. Therefore, Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that NKA regulates TJ permeability, complexity and ion selectivity through a specific Src-caveolin-claudin pathway in renal epithelial cells. Aim 2 will assess whether NKA differentially regulates the expression and trafficking of claudin isoforms. Specific Aim 3 will evaluate human relevance and assess the potential role of NKA-mediated regulation of TJ in hypertension by studying the differentiated kidney organoids from human iPS cells with NKA point mutation generated through the CRISPR technology, and nephron segments derived from animal models of salt-sensitive hypertension. Once completed, the proposed studies will provide novel molecular insight into NKA-mediated regulation of paracellular transport activity in kidney. The finding may lead to novel therapeutic options for hypertension. Finally, participation in the COBRE will provide the necessary enhanced career and scientific mentoring to become a successful independent scientist.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.',\n",
       " 'Title: Ultra Low Energy Computing for Next Generation  Implantable Smart Cardiac Pacemakers Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases are one of the major causes of all human deaths. Arrhythmia related human cardiac mortality and morbidity can be reduced by the implantable artificial pacemakers that are designed to monitor the cardiac status and to regulate the beating of the heart. Not many years ago, the functionality of a pacemaker was mostly limited to monitoring signals from the heart and assisting its operation via artificial pacing when any predefined abnormality was detected. Recently, pacemaker manufacturers have started incorporating advanced features to make the pacemaker smarter and more user friendly. With low energy wireless connectivity, the pacemakers can be programmed to automatically activate alerts to the cardiologist or to the hospital via the connected smart phone or network when an emergency occurs. In the future, the wireless connectivity may also enable the cardiologist to remotely adjust the settings of the pacemaker to address the emergency or to recommend other corrective measures. Unfortunately all the added new features come at the expense of increased power consumption. Also, the wireless connectivity of the implantable devices opens up the possibility of hacking. In the case of pacemakers a hacker will be able to maliciously reprogram the pacemaker. These device security threats lead to the need for secure communication channels. The entire computational task inside a pacemaker is done by a dedicated processor. The upcoming generation of pacemakers is expected to both diversify the processor work-load and demand significantly increased computational capabilities. This research aims to develop low-energy computation methods and design methodologies that can enable future cardiac pacemakers to become a reality. A novel concept of dynamic computing is developed as a part of this research which will enable the reduction of pacemaker power consumption by detecting and eliminating repetitions of low level arithmetic/logical operations both in software and hardware implementations. By identifying overlapping computational steps and predictable data flow patterns present in most implantable cardiac pacemaker workloads, the proposed design methodologies promise enhanced performance and improvement in battery life. Applicability of the developed techniques will be investigated and tested in the context of pacemaker signal processing, security, and reliability workloads. Nearly 225,000 permanent pacemakers are implanted annually in the United States. The battery in a pacemaker can last 8-10 years and the pacemaker itself is replaced during a surgical procedure. The development of ultra-low energy computing techniques for pacemakers is expected to extend the battery life further, which in turn will reduce the frequency of the surgical procedures needed to replace the pacemaker. The reduced number of surgical procedures will also bring down the associated health care coast. The low energy computing techniques could also enable the future pacemakers to add more advanced features without sacrificing the battery life. .',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal responds to the research need to develop powerful biomarkers of disease response and the need to better understand current modalities of tuberculosis treatment. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has been declared a global emergency. Treatment outcomes are poor, driven by toxicity and limited efficacy of the 2nd-line antituberculosis drugs. Although there is evidence that both antituberculosis activity and most of the toxicity of the key drugs are related to drug exposure, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships in patients with MDR-TB are poorly characterized. In a cohort of South African patients with MDR-TB, we plan to: 1) use innovative pharmacometric analyses to develop a biomarker model of disease regression based on time-to-positivity in liquid culture of serial sputum samples; 2) describe the population pharmacokinetics of the five drugs constituting the standard treatment regimen in nonlinear mixed effects models; 3) describe the individual susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates to those drugs, and the distribution to of the minimum inhibitory drug concentrations in the population; 4) define the frequency of drug-related side effects; 5) use computational analyses to quantify the individual contributions to efficacy and toxicity of the antituberculosis drugs used in combination. We propose to use in vitro hollow fiber models of tuberculosis (HFM-TB) to determine pharmacokinetic targets for antituberculosis activity and the suppression of resistance. Thus the (PK/PD) parameters associated with optimal efficacy, prevention of ADR and synergy will be investigated for moxifloxacin, pyrazinamide and kanamycin combinations in log-phase growth, semi-dormant and intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and then translated to patients using Monte Carlo simulations. The key PK/PD relationships defined in the clinical study will also be investigated in HFM-TB. Our study will identify doses and drug combinations for the treatment of MDR-TB that are likely to be more efficacious and less toxic than the currently used regimen. Moreover the development of a biomarker model of disease response and computational analytical methodologies will enable more efficient optimization of future regimens.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been established that proteins (and thus, their peptide products) are ribosomally translated using only L-amino acids, and so it was assumed that D-amino acids did not naturally exist in animal peptides. However, physiological D-amino containing-peptides (DAACP) do exist, first identified in frogs, resulting from a post-translationa modification: peptide isomerization. However, because they have no associated mass shift, DAACPs are historically very difficult to identify, causing a gap in mass spectrometry-driven peptide characterization studies. The objective of the proposed work aims to bridge this gap by developing tools to detect DAACPs by taking advantage of their unique properties, including their resistance to degradation by peptidases. In addition, formation of a DAACP alters the shape of a peptide, which can change its ability to bind to a receptor. This is especially important for neuropeptides, cell-cell signaling molecules that are bioactive by binding to their cognate receptor. Thus, in specific aim 1, the tools to identify DAACPs will be developed using neuropeptides from a simpler model animal, where one DAACP has already been identified. This system of DAACP discovery involves chiral analysis: breaking down an endogenous neuropeptide into its component amino acids and assaying those amino acids for their chirality using analytical chemistry methods. The long-term objective of this work is to identify functional DAACPs in the mammalian nervous system. As part of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) program areas, it is interested in the function of neurotransmitters (like neuropeptides) in endogenous systems. In spite of intensive study, more than 100 human G-protein coupled receptors have no known binding partner. DAACPs may explain, in part, the discrepancy between the number of neuropeptides known through genomic and peptidomic studies and the large number of orphan receptors. For the proposed work, in specific aim 2, neuropeptides will be studied for peptide isomerization in the context of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a hypothalamic group of neurons with a known role in circadian rhythms. The SCN is targeted because there are extensive studies on time of day release of neuropeptides and a number of peptidase-resistant peptides have already been identified in the SCN. This work is significant because NIDA has identified sleep disorders as having a link to drug abuse, so the implication of an overlooked PTM can result in many missed neuropeptide functions in our sleep/wake cycles. The discovery of DAACPs as a physiological phenomenon in mammalian neuropeptides ultimately helps reach the goal of understanding drug abuse by identifying the functional properties of neural circuits underlying drug abuse.',\n",
       " 'Lead is a heavy metal of great public health concern in the US and globally. In addition to its well- characterized developmental neurotoxicity, cumulative lead exposure is also neurotoxic to adults and can lead to accelerated, persistent cognitive decline in adult humans. The apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE) exists as three polymorphic alleles in humans (?2, ?3, ?4); the ApoE -?3 allele (simplified as ApoE3 hereafter) is the most common allele. The ApoE-?4 allele (simplified as ApoE4 hereafter) is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer?s disease, and accelerated cognitive decline even in the absence of Alzheimer?s disease pathology. The hippocampus is a region of the brain critical for learning and memory, especially spatial learning. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is the process whereby adult neural stem cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus leads to the generation and functional integration of adult-born neurons in the hippocampus. These adult-born neurons can influence hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Although adult neurogenesis is modulated by various extracellular stimuli, by the environment, and by neurotoxicants including lead and ethanol, there is a paucity of information regarding the effect of gene-environment interactions (GxE) on adult neurogenesis. This proposal focuses on the effect of lead-genetic background interactions on adult neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Neonatal pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious condition that affects up to one third of premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This entity, known as BPD-associated PH (BPD-PH), is fully established by 1-3 months of age and incurs a four-fold increased risk of death. Survivors of BPD-PH have prolonged and recurrent hospitalizations, and are at risk for chronic cardiopulmonary and metabolic problems. We are committed to developing targeted strategies to prevent BPD-PH in premature infants. Two promising therapeutic targets are the histologic marker, placental maternal vascular underperfusion (MVU) and the intermediate cord blood-derived fetal monocytes (iMNC) that circulate at birth. Our central hypothesis is that fetal iMNCs are adversely programmed by the chronic fetal hypoxia of placental MVU, and contribute to early delayed lung angiogenesis leading to BPD-PH. In Aim #1, we will elucidate the mechanism by which MVU leads to delayed neonatal angiogenesis. Using fetal growth restriction (FGR, birth weight <5th percentile) as the proxy for chronic fetal hypoxia, we will compare iMNC VEGFR1 expression via flow cytometric analysis of 100 cord blood samples from the following groups of infants: 1) preterm MVU with FGR; 2) preterm MVU without FGR; 3) preterm no MVU with FGR; 4) preterm no MVU no FGR (preterm control); 5) term no MVU no FGR (term control). In isolated iMNCs, we will use PCR Array to compare the gene expression profiles of these groups and identify novel gene targets and pathways driven by MVU. In Aim #2 we will identify the perinatal mechanisms by which MVU-exposed fetal iMNCs contribute to delayed neonatal lung angiogenesis: In cultured iMNCs exposed to experimental hypoxia and hyperoxia, we will evaluate VEGFA and VEGFR1 gene and protein expression. We will perform chemotaxis assays to compare iMNC migration in response to exogenous treatment with placental growth factor (PIGF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), and we will compare iMNC expression of VEGFR1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from intubated preterm infants. Lastly, in Aim #3 we will transplant iMNCs from the 5 patient groups into newborn human GM-CSF knock-in (humanized) mice, and follow the lung histology and PH parameters after chronic hyperoxia exposure (85% oxygen x 14 days).

In order to meet an increasing physiological demand of the growing embryo, the developing heart undergoes complex morphogenetic changes to optimize its ventricular myoarchitecture for more efficient contraction. This proposal is focused on ventricular maturation that is characterized by the formation of muscular protrusions called cardiac trabeculae. Our prior studies revealed that cardiac trabeculation is initiated by directional cardiomyocyte migration from the compact layer, and that ErbB2 cell-autonomously regulates this process. We also found that biomechanical forces generated by the functioning embryonic heart is required for cardiac trabeculation. However, several outstanding questions remain to be addressed, including those related to 1) the mechanism by which mechanical stimulus is sensed and translated into spatial and temporal signals to regulate cardiac trabeculation and 2) the exact function of cardiac trabeculae in the heart. It has been recognized that there exists an intimate relationship between cardiac function and cardiac form. In this research program, we hypothesize that mechanical-biochemical interaction is essential for cardiac trabecular formation and induces pathological hypertrophic remodeling in the absence of trabecular formation. In support of this hypothesis, we found that primary cilia-mediated flow sensing is required for trabeculation through activation of Notch signaling in the ventricular endocardium. While biomechanical forces are required to initiate trabeculation, our preliminary study also revealed an essential role of cardiac trabeculae in handling the mechanical forces generated by cardiac contraction. To test our hypothesis, we propose to further delineate the mechanical-biochemical cellular signaling responsible for 1) trabecular formation, and 2) cardiac dysfunction due to trabecular malformation. The successful completion of this proposal will not only define the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ventricular maturation but also provide further mechanistic insight into the inter-relationship between cardiac function and cardiac form.',\n",
       " 'Neurodegenerative diseases represent an ever-increasing societal and economic burden with WHO estimates indicating that they will replace cancer as the 2nd leading cause of death by 2040. In neurodegenerative disease research, a wealth of pathways has been uncovered, but their direct and primary relevance to the respective human disease has been difficult to prove and targeting of pathways has remained difficult. The proposed work will identify a treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), a hereditary neurodegenerative disease affecting cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and other neurons in the cerebellum, the subcortical grey matter and spinal cord. The cause of SCA2 is a gain-of-function CAG expansion in the ATXN2 gene resulting in an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) domain in ataxin-2. Our objective is identification of highly-potent antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that lower ATXN2 expression. Our rationale is based on observations in model organisms and humans indicating that higher dosages of the mutant allele/protein worsen disease severity and that down-regulation of mutant polyQ protein expression in rodents reverses clinical manifestations even after mice have become symptomatic. Additionally, complete knock-out of ATXN2 in mice does not cause neurodegeneration or premature death. Merit for this study is supported by positive results in ongoing clinical trials to test ASOs for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), as well as the success of SPINRAZA? (Nusinersen) for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the first ever FDA approved ASO drug for a neurodegenerative disorder. The feasibility of this study is based on our positive proof-of-concept data demonstrating that our lead ATXN2 ASO delays progressive rodent SCA2 motor, molecular, and neurophysiological phenotypes after symptom onset. Five specific aims are proposed: 1) an intensive in vitro screen of ASOs targeting throughout the ATXN2 pre-mRNA including cultured SCA2 patient cells, 2) in vivo screens to identify leads lowering cerebellar ATXN2 in mice, 3) safety toxicity testing in rodents and other species, 4) testing the ASO leads for delaying established SCA2 mouse motor, molecular, and neurophysiological phenotypes, and 5) GMP manufacturing of the single most potent ASO candidate and pre-investigative new drug (IND) meetings with members of the FDA. The proposed work will break new ground for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by demonstrating feasibility of targeting dominant-acting mutated polyQ genes with antisense oligonucleotides.',\n",
       " 'Abstract In the United States, hypertension (HTN) is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a more significant problem among Black women. About 46.1% of Black women over the age of 20 have HTN compared to White (30.1%) and Hispanic (29.9%) women. Currently, the prevalence of HTN in Black women is highest in the United States and is expected to increase underscoring the relatively ineffective prevention and management efforts for blood pressure (BP) control. Blacks tend to develop HTN earlier in life with greater severity and more organ damage when compared to Whites and uncontrolled HTN increases the risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, stoke, and kidney disease. Black females experience a substantially higher death rate from HTN at 2.1 times the rate of both White and Hispanic females. Poor execution of evidence-based HTN guidelines and clinical inertia among healthcare providers along with patient nonadherence to prescribed treatment contribute to poor BP control. It is well known that antihypertensive medications along with lifestyle modifications have proven efficacy in lowering BP when adhered to consistently. However, for Blacks, the lingering effects of their historical legacy, continued segregated communities, high poverty rates, and unequal medical treatment, place them in a unique position to view healthcare with skepticism that differs from all other racial/ethnic groups. Thus, accepted approaches to HTN management have not been optimally effective in producing sustained BP control for Black women. Since nonadherence occurs in the context of everyday living, strategies are needed that encourage more active individual engagement in health care behaviors and self- care activities, in the physical and social environment where they can be performed by patients independently. The objective of this NHLBI K01 Mentored Career Development Award is to obtain research training and develop the skills needed to be an independent investigator, and to use those skills to test the effectiveness of an established Chronic Disease Self-management Program (CDSMP) plus an innovative interactive technology-enhanced coaching (ITEC) system, on improving BP control in community-dwelling Black women with uncontrolled HTN. The proposed project is a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), repeated measures design, with specific aims to determine whether the effects of CDSMP combined with ITEC will maintain BP control, attain medication adherence, and achieve lifestyle modifications (medication adherence, physical activity, diet, and weight management) compared to the CDSMP alone. We hypothesize that participants who receive self-care management and interactive coaching with technology will have lower systolic/diastolic BP and better adherence to antihypertensive medication(s) and lifestyle recommendations post intervention compared to participants receiving self-care management alone. The expected outcome of this study will provide preliminary evidence to inform the design of a fully powered RCT for an R01 application before the end of the K Award.',\n",
       " 'SUMMARY Chronic lung disease, including fibrosis, is the fourth leading cause of mortality worldwide. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a debilitating pathology that impedes overall tissue function. A common comorbidity in fibrosis is vasculopathy, characterized by remodeling and loss of microvessels, which substantially worsens prognosis and limits survival, most current therapeutic strategies being largely palliative. The relevance of neovascularization to the pathophysiology of fibrosis has never been resolved as conflicting evidence depicts angiogenesis as both, reparative or pathologic. Therefore, we must begin to understand and model the underlying pathobiology of PVD, alone and with fibrosis, to define cell interactions necessary to maintain normal function and promote repair. We have identified a novel model of vasculopathy dependent on the function of adult pulmonary resident mesenchymal pericyte progenitors (ABCG2pos MPC). The MPC regulate microvascular function during tissue homeostasis and the extent of vasculopathy in lung tissue. Therefore, lung MPC is a previously unstudied target that should be exploited to identify new mechanisms and therapeutic targets relevant to the pathobiology of PVD associated with fibrosis. A premise for this proposal is that that ABCG2pos lung MPC are key constituents of the microvascular niche, as such, disrupted ABCG2pos MPC differentiation accounts in part for the deregulation of microvessel function and remodeling associated with PVD and exacerbation of fibrosis. We hypothesize that ABCG2posMPC regulated loss of microvessel function drives the development of persistent vasculopathy, which exacerbates the onset and development of fibrosis in the lung. In this proposal, we will test that activation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling in MPC exacerbates the onset and persistence of fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. We hypothesize that MPC derived DKK1 modulates MPC-MVEC interactions via regulation of direct cell - cell communication and paracrine effects on MVEC function. We will also test that modulation of DKK1 expression and signaling activity in ABCG2pos MPC will restore microvascular function and attenuate fibrosis. Both in vivo and in vitro we will repurpose drugs currently approved and utilized as chemotherapeutic agents with WT, IPF, PVD MPC & murine models. Successful completion of the proposed studies will define the therapeutic potential for targeting the Dkk1/Lrp6 signaling pathway identified in MPC to restore microvessel function and decrease fibrotic remodeling. We are poised to complete these studies with combined expertise and tools specific to our group.',\n",
       " \"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public and VA health concern and exerts substantial burden on as many as 30% (estimates range 14-30%) of veterans returning from deployment in Afghanistan and Iraq from Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). The past two decades of functional neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have implicated brain dysfunction during cognitive processing in PTSD. However, the limitations of PET and fMRI (high cost, labor and skill intensive, not always tolerated, poor portability) make their translation to clinical application in `real world' settings problematic. Therefore, alternative, `proxy' neuroscience approaches that leverage the existing knowledge about brain function gained from fMRI and PET but that are cost-effective and convenient, and that provide data from larger samples in clinical settings are much needed. Electroencephalography (EEG) measures neurophysiology-based event-related potentials (ERP), is a portable, easy-to-use technique that can be deployed in the `real world' office setting and provides time-locked neural activity measures that have excellent test-retest reliability and temporal resolution. ERPs can track quick and transient cognitive demands and emotionally arousing events. Of the cognitive domains, attention/working memory (WM) dysfunction is a consistently observed and robust impairment in combat PTSD. Moreover, WM can be exacerbated by the interference of emotionally arousing trauma-related ?distractors ? together they are thought to be responsible for the everyday concentration and memory difficulties and re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms of PTSD. Work in our lab and others have shown that ERPs such as the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and late positive potential (LPP) are robust neural indices of visual working memory capacity and emotional arousal, and are altered in depression and anxiety disorders. The extent literature and our Preliminary Data compels us to focus on visual working memory because it has high clinical relevance, is impaired in PTSD and related to PTSD severity, and can be quantified with EEG. It is also important to directly compare PTSD against other internalizing psychopathologies (e.g., Major Depressive Disorder, [MDD], in order to make inferences that cognitive and neurophysiological impairments are specific to PTSD. Using an innovative EEG task ? validated in our laboratory - that dynamically integrates working memory and emotional interference with trauma reminders, the current project proposes to address the following Specific Aims/questions: 1) Do combat veterans with PTSD (compared to those without PTSD) have an attenuated contralateral delay activity (CDA) during visual working memory performance? Does CDA magnitude relate specifically to PTSD symptom severity? [Cognition Alone]; 2) Do combat veterans with PTSD (compared to those without PTSD) have an exaggerated late positive potential (LPP) when processing emotionally arousing trauma reminders? Does LPP magnitude specifically relate to PTSD symptom severity? [Emotion Alone]; 3) Does the intrusion of trauma reminders further impair visual working memory performance and further reduce contralateral delay activity in combat veterans with PTSD (and not in veterans without PTSD)? [Emotion on Cognition Interaction]. Comprehensive psychiatric, neuropsychological testing and EEG- ERP imaging will conducted in three groups (N=60 per group) of OEF/OIF/OND combat veterans (PTSD Group, MDD Group, and Control Group) with similar levels of combat trauma exposure. This design allows for both categorical and continuous analyses in order to link brain function with measures of cognitive function specific to PTSD. The overarching objective is to elucidate precise, brain-based markers and targets of PTSD so that we can improve and expand on therapeutic interventions for our veterans.\",\n",
       " 'Project Description Feeding behavior is influenced by multiple factors including food palatability and nutritional needs. Peripheral chemosensory taste neurons primarily detect palatable food, but animals lacking these taste neurons can still develop a preference to sugars on the basis of their nutritional value. My laboratory previously determined that dSLC5A11+, EB R4d neurons in the Drosophila brain are required for the selection of nutritive D- glucose over nonnutritive L-glucose after periods of starvation. dSLC5A11 (or cupcake) acts on approximately 12 pairs of EB R4d neurons to trigger the selection of nutritive sugars, but the mechanism underlying this process is not understood. We previously proposed two possible mechanisms by which EB R4 neurons may mediate the selection of nutritive sugars: (1) by detecting the nutritional value of sugar through direct activation or (2) monitoring the internal energy reserves of the fly with a direct nutrient sensor located elsewhere; starved flies lacking functional EB R4d neurons cannot sense the deprived metabolic state and, thus, would not select nutritive sugars.  Through calcium imaging and a more-sensitive electrophysiology approach, we tested whether EB R4d neurons respond to nutritive sugars, but failed to observe any responses to glucose or any other sugars. Instead, the activity of EB R4d neurons and the expression of dSLC5A11 transcript increase significantly following periods of starvation. Furthermore, the increased dSLC5A11 suppresses dKCNQ currents, thereby increasing the activity of EB R4d neurons during starvation. Recently, we found that EB R4d neurons are robustly activated by serotonin, which is apparently secreted by the neurons labeled by R50H05-GAL4. These R50H05+ neurons were shown to promote food intake, similar to EB R4d neurons. We also found that another population of the EB Ring neurons, apparently the neighboring EB R4m neurons, suppress food intake.  In this renewal application, we propose to study the following questions based on our published and preliminary results. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms by which EB R4d neurons are activated. We will further elucidate the dSLC5A11/dKCNQ- mediated mechanism, but also investigate the dSLC5A11?independent mechanism in which serotonin plays critical roles in stimulating the activity of EB R4d neurons and the expression of dSLC5A11 transcript. In Aim 2, we will determine whether EB R4d neurons function downstream of R50H05+ neurons. In Aim 3, we will validate that the recently identified EB R4m neurons suppress food intake and characterize the interactions between EB R4m and EB R4d neurons, and between EB R4d or EB R4m neurons, and the sleep-promoting EB R2 neurons.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Dendrites exhibit immense diversity in their macrostructure (arbors), which stipulates the availability of a neuron to circuits and its computational properties, and microstructure (dendritic spines), which dynamically support and shape synaptic function. Arbor and spine/synapse development must be coordinated to form functional dendrites. Though synaptic activity plays a crucial role, the heterogeneity of developmental responses to activity indicates that other mechanisms are required. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor (A-GPCR) brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1/ ADGRB1) coordinates dendritic arbor and spine development through differential activation of multiple signaling pathways. This hypothesis is based on our published and preliminary data showing: (i) that BAI1 mediates growth arrest of dendritic arbors via a novel pathway coupling to the Rho-family small GTPase RhoA; (ii) that BAI1 promotes excitatory synaptogenesis in cortical and hippocampal neurons via the Rho-family small GTPase Rac1 and trans-synaptic signaling; and (iii) that BAI1 differentially affects dendrite development in an age-dependent manner and that altering BAI1 configuration has age-dependent effects on downstream signaling pathways. We propose a multidisciplinary approach to define the roles of BAI A-GPCRs in regulating and coordinating dendritic arbor and spine/synapse development utilizing in vivo and cultured neurons, genetic models, molecular replacement, live imaging with fluorescent reporters, mixed culture assays, biochemistry and electrophysiology. The pathways that we are defining include proteins implicated in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder (Bcr), autism spectrum disorder (neuroligin-1 and IRSp53), and schizophrenia (BAI3). Thus, success of this proposal will not only provide material advances in the study of dendrite development and synaptogenesis, but also test a novel and powerful hypothesis regarding the coordination of these processes and provide new therapeutic targets against widespread human mental diseases.',\n",
       " \"Depressive symptoms, including negative self-focused emotions (e.g., sadness, guilt), make trauma- exposed Veterans vulnerable to developing depressive pathology and substance use disorders (SUD). Both conditions are in turn linked to persistent executive and functional impairments. A common marker of both depression severity and addictive behavior is anhedonia, i.e., reduced ability to seek and experience pleasure/ healthy rewards, with evidence of reduced neural activity in the reward centers of the brain. Such reward sensitivity alterations are thus likely to play a critical role in promoting depressive and addictive pathology in trauma-exposed Veterans. A precise understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting reward- based decision-making, and how mood is integrated into these processes, is therefore needed to: a) understand the contribution of these risk factors to current and future psychopathology, b) help detect and predict treatment needs/outcomes for Veterans with such complex clinical profiles. Bayesian models can offer a powerful quantitative account of these intricate mechanisms by disentangling: a) learning processes (prediction of reward likelihood in the environment), and b) action selection strategies (choosing an action based on those predictions). This computational framework can help better delineate how low mood impacts both the prediction of rewards, and the integration of these predictions into decision strategies. Moreover, given that existing treatments for trauma-exposed Veterans focus on reducing anxiety symptoms, there is a significant need for developing behavioral treatments that can more thoroughly target depressive symptoms associated with low reward responsiveness, such as anhedonia and substance use. Computationally based assessment of reward processing alterations may be particularly useful and timely for providing new treatment targets and directions for improving such treatment outcomes for trauma-exposed Veterans.  To address these questions, we propose to use computational modeling and neuroimaging to identify precise affective neurocognitive predictors of psychopathology and behavioral treatment response in recently deployed young (age 20-40) trauma-exposed Veterans. This project will use Bayesian modeling applied to the analysis of reward-based decisions, with baseline dependent measures of brain circuit activity derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and experimental manipulation of mood, to delineate precisely a) how sad mood may bias the learning or strategic adjustments guiding reward-based decisions in Veterans, b) the degree to which these affect-driven computational biases relate to depression and problem substance use symptoms in this population, and c) the degree to which these computational markers can predict Veterans' response to a cognitive behavioral treatment targeting depressive symptoms associated with trauma, including guilt and anhedonia. In other words, can computational methods be useful in identifying low reward sensitivity in the depressed brain, and in directing early on Veterans with such markers towards more appropriate and effective treatments? The outcomes of this study will identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of reward responsiveness, affective clinical profile, and treatment response, and provide a cognitive rationale for developing more targeted and effective interventions for Veterans.  This CDA-2 award will facilitate the applicant's training in the utilization of computational and neuroimaging techniques 1) to understand the role of affect-driven cognitive biases in promoting depressive and substance use symptoms, and 2) to predict treatment response and long-term clinical course. Such training will in turn facilitate the applicant's long-term career goals to become a productive and successful VA clinical scientist, whose work focuses on improving early detection and effective treatment of psychopathology in Veterans.\",\n",
       " \"Burkholderia mallei and B. pseudomallei are bacterial pathogens and causative agents of glanders and melioidosis, respectively. At present, effective vaccines for prevention of glanders or meliodosis have not been developed. However, renewed attention has been directed toward development of Burkholderia vaccines because of the pathogens' seemingly ideal characteristics for malicious use as a biowarfare weapon. Additionally, a vaccine will also have significant value for the immunization of at-risk populations in melioidosis/glanders endemic areas of the world. Therefore, our long-term goal is to develop a platform that allows for the efficient generation of a multicomponent vaccine which is able to protect against both glanders and melioidosis. Our approach will use glycoconjugates coupled to gold nanoparticles (NP) and test their protective properties in clinically relevant models of infection. The central hypothesis tested indicates that protein antigens of B. mallei or B. pseudomallei coupled to NP polysaccharides will elicit protection in relevant mammalian species, and that these antigens will correlate with clinically important serologic/immunologic readouts. The hypothesis will be evaluated by developing different protein-polysaccharide NPs and comparing their efficacy in vivo. The flexible NP platform will allow us to additionally incorporate novel antigens identified by other groups as further enhancing protective immunity. We will establish an optimal immunization procedure and test the efficacies of protein-polysaccharide NPs in a clinically relevant and highly controlled aerosol murine model of infection. Finally, we aim to identify the correlates/biomarkers of protection induced by protein- polysaccharide NP vaccination. This proposal is innovative because it capitalizes on the use of a subunit-NP vaccine, which could be easily licensable because of its lower cost and more widely disseminated vaccinations for at-risk populations. Together, these outcomes will help us to identify correlates of protection from protein- polysaccharide nanoparticles and provide optimized vaccination strategies.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is genetic disorder characterized by degeneration of elastic fibers that leads to dermatologic, ocular and cardiovascular abnormalities, involving progressive calcification of the soft tissues. Calcification can occur within the heart muscle, particularly after injury, and predisposes these patients to cardiac dysfunction or sudden death from ventricular arrhythmias. PXE is caused by mutations in the ATP Binding Cassette C6 transporter gene (ABCC6) yet little is understood how deficiency of ABCC6 induces ectopic calcification in multiple soft tissues. Calcification of soft tissues is thought to be an active process where bone forming osteoblast-like cells are recruited to the affected tissue and cause mineralization of the extracellular matrix, a process analogous to cancellous bone formation. However the nature of the cells contributing to soft tissue calcification in the heart and other organs in PXE and how this is regulated by ABCC6 are unknown. The Deb lab has recently shown that cardiac fibroblasts are not terminally differentiated and presents preliminary data to suggest that fibroblast adopt osteogenic fates and directly contribute to heart muscle calcification in a mouse model of PXE. The Lusis lab was one of the first labs to identify and clone ABCC6 as an important gene regulating soft tissue calcification. In this multi PI proposal, the Deb and Lusis labs interrogate the role of fibroblast plasticity in directly contributing to heart muscle calcification in ABCC6 deficient animals, investigate i) spatio-temporal dynamics of fibroblast-osteoblast transitions ii) biochemical mechanisms regulating fibroblast mediated calcification and ?iii) the physiologic significance of fibroblast mediated calcification. We provide preliminary data that mechanisms regulating calcification in ABCC6 deficiency are dysregulated in other common causes of ectopic calcification such as human heart valve calcification and investigate strategies to inhibit final common pathways mediating ectopic calcification, regardless of the underlying pathology.',\n",

These complex tissues ? bone, cartilage, vasculature, and cardiac ? are characterized by dense cellularity, patterned cellular composition, and controlled matrix presentation. The proposed Biomedical Technology Resource Center (BTRC) will address this critical need by applying three-dimensional printing (3DP) strategies to the engineering of complex tissues. This BTRC brings together research leaders at the University of Maryland, Rice University, and Wake Forest University, all highly regarded collaborators in the field, to lead the development of the Center for Engineering Complex Tissues (CECT, [sees-t]). Strong and effective administrative leadership will maximize productivity, enhance ongoing collaborations, and ensure sound fiscal and compliance management for this BTRC. The technical components of CECT consist of 3 Technology Research and Development Projects (TR&Ds), 6 Collaborative Projects (CPs), and 6 Service Projects (SPs). An External Advisory Committee (EAC), that will guide and advise the strategic direction of the Center, will be assembled from world-renowned researchers with biomedical expertise relevant to the CECT. A Local Executive Committee (LEC) will coordinate the effort across the participating institutions involved in the day-to- day operations of the Center. We will also focus on growing a community engaged in developing and utilizing complex engineered tissues by offering a series of programs to help develop and establish these technologies. Communications programs will also be developed for the dissemination of the Center?s activities to enable a broader use of the technologies. The long-term plan for the CECT is that it will become a national hub for transforming current 3DP and tissue engineering technologies into new and improved platforms for everyday uses in regenerative medicine and biomedical device development.',\n",
       " 'Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with a median overall survival limited to 1 year for advanced disease. A significant fraction of GC is due to aberrant HGF/MET axis signaling, most commonly due to MET receptor gene amplification. However, no effective MET-targeted therapies are currently available, with resistance frequently emerging rapidly, following an initial response. The development of additional, alternative approaches to effectively inhibit MET and other RTKs is therefore a necessity for a cure to be found.  We recently identified a number of novel soluble decoy RTKs isoforms (sdRTKs), generated by an alternative splicing/intronic polyadenylation (IPA) mechanism, which can act as potent natural inhibitors of RTK signaling. We developed an antisense-based method to specifically and effectively induce IPA usage and sdRTKs expression in vitro and in vivo. These compounds identify a new class of drugs that carry the advantage of simultaneously knocking down the pathological targets while introducing natural dominant-negative isoforms, thus greatly increasing their efficacy.  We will apply this antisense-based approach to promote IPA and stimulate the expression of dominant-negative, endogenous soluble decoy MET inhibitory variants (sdMET), normally expressed at low levels. sdMETs encode the extracellular ligand-binding and dimerization domains, but lack the transmembrane and the intracellular kinase domains. We hypothesize that sdMET-inducing compounds suppress HGF/MET signaling by a three fold-mechanism: A) direct removal of full-length MET receptor mRNAs, B) binding and sequestration of MET ligand (HGF), and C) non- productive hetero-dimerization with residual MET receptors. We further posit that, as the resulting products are secreted from targeted cells, they affect signaling in both targeted and neighboring cells alike and interfere with paracrine and autocrine loops, thus wielding an amplified effect. Since the mechanism of action is different from that of current therapies, this strategy should be effective in all tumors that rely on HGF/MET signaling, including relapsing ones. To this end, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Identification and characterization of effective inhibitory sdMET splicing variants. 2) Reprogramming of MET splicing/polyadenylation in gastric cancer cells by antisense-based splicing redirection compounds that induce IPA. 3) Assessment of the therapeutic potential of sdMET-inducing antisense oligonucleotides in multiple gastric cancer models, in vitro and in vivo.  These results will be important for the development of powerful novel investigative tools and therapeutic approaches in any cancer type where the HGF/MET signaling axis plays a determinant role. The findings emerging from this study will be broadly translatable to disease dependent on other RTKs and oncogenes, in gastric cancer and other tumors.

       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Changes to the extracellular matrix (ECM) help direct the inflammatory response to tissue injury and resolution of inflammation. During inflammation, TNF-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) covalently modifies the ECM polysaccharide hyaluronic acid (HA) with the heavy chains (HCs) from the serum protein inter-alpha-inhibitor (I?I). This cross-linking of HA is exclusively carried out by TSG-6 and only occurs during tissue injury, where inflammatory mediators are present to induce TSG-6 secretion and leaky vessels allow serum I?I to enter tissue. While HA cross-linking is present in histopathological lesions of various chronic lung diseases, the presence and role of TSG-6 mediated cross-linking in acute lung injury remains undefined. This proposal will establish for the first time the role of HA cross-linking in directing leukocyte recruitment and delaying resolution during acute lung inflammation. The clinically relevant murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) induced acute lung injury and repair will be used to test the hypothesis that TSG-6 mediated HA cross-linking mediates the recruitment of pro-inflammatory macrophages to the airway (Aim 1) and prolongs inflammation (Aim 2). In Aim 1, we will utilize mice deficient for TSG-6 and I?I as well as TSG-6 supplementation in I?I mice to specifically determine the role of TSG-6 mediated HA cross-linking in the recruitment of pro-inflammatory macrophages. In Aim 2, we will utilize TSG-6 loss of function approaches (TSG-6 null mice and neutralization antibody) to determine the effect of inhibiting TSG-6 on the rate of epithelial repair following PA infection. Completion of these aims will establish a new understanding of the role of TSG-6 induction in the lung and its evolutionarily conserved modifying of HA during inflammation that may yield new therapeutic strategies for lung repair.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Chronic  cocaine  exposure  causes  maladaptive  neuroplasticity  in  brain  reward  circuitry  that  leads  to  compulsive  drug  use,  loss  of  control  over  intake,  and  vulnerability  to  relapse,  even  after  protracted  abstinence. Initial drug reward is mediated by the nucleus accumbens in the ventral striatum, and early  goal ?directed  drug  intake  is  dependent  on  this  structure.  As  drug  use  transitions  from  goal ?directed  to  compulsive, there is a corresponding anatomical transition from dependence on the ventral striatum to  dorsal  striatum  habit  circuitry.  MicroRNAs  (miRNA)  are  small  (~21 ?23  nucleotide)  non ?coding  RNA  sequences  that  regulate  mRNA  stability  and  translation  by  complementary  binding  to  the  3?  UTR  of  the  mRNA.  Each  miRNA  can  regulate  the  binding  of  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of  mRNA.  Our  lab  has  previously  identified  that  miR ?212  regulates  cocaine  intake  under  extended  access  conditions,  but  not  during  restricted  access.  Specifically,  overexpressing  miR ?212  in  the  dorsal  striatum  decreases  cocaine  intake during 6 ?hour self ?administration sessions, whereas using a knocking down miR ?212 in this region  augments cocaine intake in rats. The precise cellular mechanism of action of miR ?212 is not known. The  dorsal  striatum  is  primarily  composed  of  medium  spiny  neurons  (MSNs;  95%  of  cells),  which  can  be  further  broken  down  by  their  receptor  composition  and  anatomical  projections.  Dopamine  D1  receptor  (DRD1)  expressing  neurons  form  a  direct  pathway  that  innervates  the  substantia  nigra  (striatonigral  pathway), and neurons expressing the D2 receptor and the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) project to the  pallidum (striatopallidal pathway). These cell populations have opposite contributions to tasks involving  movement, and more notably reward, such as cocaine conditioned place preference. This proposal seeks  to  examine  the  contributions  of  miR ?212  specifically  in  each  of  these  two  cell  populations  in  order  to  elucidate  its  mechanism  of  action  in  regulating  cocaine  seeking.  To  do  this,  in  aim  1  I  will  use  novel  genetically  modified  mice  to  create  conditional  knockouts  of  miR ?212  in  either  DRD1 ?expressing  MSNs,  or  in  A2AR ?expressing  MSNs.  These  mice  will  be  tested  under  either  restricted  or  extended  access  to  cocaine, and the contribution of miR ?212 during each of these phases will be assessed.  In aim 2, I will use  a novel high throughput screening following crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS ?CLIP) technique to  examine mRNA targets of miR ?212 specifically in striatonigral vs striatopallidal neurons. Together, these  aims  will  provide  me  with  excellent  training  in  mouse  genetics  and  behavioral  models,  as  well  as  advanced  RNA  biochemistry  and  large  high  throughput  screening  data  sets,  including  bioinformatics  analysis of such data sets.

       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) causes profound loss of quality of life and over $10B of expense to the US healthcare system annually. Treatment options are primarily limited to corticosteroids, antibiotics and surgery. CRS is conventionally divided into two major forms, one without nasal polyp formation (CRSsNP), and one with nasal polyp formation (CRSwNP). A particularly severe form of CRSwNP is Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD). Patients with AERD suffer from both nasal polyposis and asthma, usually in severe forms. The fundamental hypothesis to be tested by this proposal is that a combination of defects in the immune barrier along with activation of inflammatory and structural cells drives pathogenesis in CRS and AERD. Secondary central goals of this proposal include advancement of our knowledge of pathogenesis of CRSwNP and AERD, development of a new microparticle (MP) based tool for diagnosis of AERD and assessment of the importance of hormones and cytokines in epithelial activation in CRS pathogenesis. We will use a combination of large, robust studies of patients undergoing surgery for CRS and cutting edge laboratory-based and bioinformatics approaches to study CRS pathogenic mechanisms. The proposed work is divided into three specific aims. In the first aim, we will test the hypothesis that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a hallmark feature of CRSwNP reflecting underlying endocrine disturbances and associates with severity and outcomes in CRSwNP. We will relate the extent of EMT in epithelial scrapings from CRSwNP, AERD and controls to disease endpoints to test our hypotheses that hormonal changes, Oncostatin M and Epiregulin play important roles in CRS- associated EMT and CRS pathogenesis. In the second aim, we will test the hypothesis that inflammatory leukocytes, structural cells and mast cells are activated in CRSwNP and AERD and contribute to symptoms and disease activity. We will use an innovative MP assay combined with flow cytometry and RNASeq (Drop-Seq) to assess activation of basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, endothelial cells and epithelial cells in controls and patients with CRSwNP or AERD. We will relate cell activation to disease severity assessed using CT, endoscopy, treatment history, questionnaires and tissue pathology. We will link inflammatory endpoints to EMT and important clinical endpoints. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that greater activation of eosinophils, basophils, mast cells and platelets explains the greater severity of disease in AERD. In aim three, we will use the MP assay to identify patients with undiagnosed AERD among a large cohort of patients with CRSwNP and comorbid asthma. We will confirm or eliminate diagnosis of AERD with aspirin challenge to validate the MP test. These studies will advance knowledge of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of CRS and AERD and bring us closer to new diagnostics and therapeutic interventions.',\n",
       " 'Summary Despite recent progress in reducing severe disease in sub-Saharan Africa, malaria remains one of the largest global public health burdens and a leading cause of mortality in children in low and middle income countries. There is an urgent need for an effective malaria vaccine because resistance has emerged to every antimalarial drug that has been publicly released to date. Vaccines against Plasmodium falciparum, the major cause of malaria in Africa, have received extensive support and are showing encouraging signs, but vaccine research for Plasmodium vivax, the major cause of malaria outside of Africa, has to date been extremely limited. This proposal will use the lessons from P. falciparum vaccine development, which for too long focussed on a limited number of candidates and did not make use of the full depth of available genomic sequence information. The central objective is to carry out the first comprehensive reverse vaccinology assessment of P. vivax blood stage antigens, combining advanced genomic and cellular techniques with ex vivo phenotyping assays. An established eukaryotic protein expression system will be used to express a library of >200 P. vivax blood stage vaccine candidates, which will be selected based on gene expression, biophysical characteristics and genomic diversity criteria. All expression constructs will be made freely available to the research community to aid global P. vivax vaccine and biology research efforts. The expressed proteins will be screened for antibody binding to confirm correct folding, and used in erythrocyte and receptor binding assays to prioritise targets for further study. Polyclonal antibodies will be raised against 100 targets and used in ex vivo P. vivax invasion phenotyping assays, to identify antibodies that block parasite invasion or growth. P. vivax parasites from both South America and Southeast Asia will be used at this stage of screening, introducing antigenic diversity at the earliest stage of target prioritization, another important lesson from P. falciparum vaccine development where strain-specific inhibitory responses derailed several promising candidates. Antibodies that provide cross- strain inhibition will be tested in combination to identify >4 highly effective and synergistic candidates for future development and potential clinical testing. The proposal will radically change the scale and pace of P. vivax vaccine development, and will produce resources of broad utility to the malaria research community.',\n",
       " \"Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread apicomplexan parasite that causes life-threatening disease in neonates and immunocompromised individuals. T. gondii and other apicomplexan parasites use a unique form of gliding motility to invade into and escape from cells of their hosts and to disseminate throughout the body during infection. It is well established that T. gondii MyosinA (TgMyoA) plays an important role in parasite motility, and parasites lacking TgMyoA are completely avirulent. How TgMyoA and the proteins with which it interacts work together to drive motility is therefore a fundamentally important question. Recent data have called into question the current ?linear motor? model of motility and suggested the existence of a parallel, non- TgMyoA-based motility mechanism.  This project will fill in a key gap in our understanding of parasite motility by determining the directionality of the forces generated by a parasite as it moves through the extracellular matrix. Capitalizing on our experience in high-speed imaging and analysis of parasite 3D motility and on our longstanding collaboration with mathematician Mark Rould, the Specific Aims of the project are to: (1) Develop 3D matrix deformation mapping methods to visualize the directionality of the forces moving parasites exert on the surrounding extracellular matrix and (2) Use 3D matrix deformation mapping to test key predictions of the linear motor model of T. gondii motility and to determine how disruption of the motor machinery affects the ability of the parasite to generate force.  Motility plays a central role in the life cycle and virulence of T. gondii, yet the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. Understanding how the parasite generates force and determining whether it can use alternative mechanisms in the absence of TgMyoA will be critical to developing new, effective drugs that target parasite motility. The innovative methods developed here will be used to test key tenets of the current model of parasite motility, bring clarity to the role of TgMyoA and enable new approaches to analyzing motility based on the parasite's ability to generate force. Since the proteins and mechanisms underlying motility appear to be conserved among apicomplexans, the new mechanistic insights generated by this study and the future work it enables are likely to be directly relevant not just to T. gondii, but to other apicomplexan parasites as well. .\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract  Hospital related bacterial infections which are generally associated with biofilms are a significant health care problem in the US. Although bacteria that repopulate biofilms are often sensitive to the antibiotics used, biofilms interestingly have a high propensity to relapse. In this phenomenon, after the majority of the cells have been killed upon exposure to antibiotics, a small number of tolerant cells survive the treatment. This subpopulation eventually regains their ability to proliferate after the conclusion of treatment, and forms a cell population that has the same antibiotic sensitivity of the original cell population. Persisters and ?viable but non- culturable? cells (VBNCs) are two phenotypic variants identified so far, which are highly tolerant to antibiotics and the underlying cause of this infection reoccurrence. Unfortunately, many physiological aspects of these phenotypes remain elusive and this significant knowledge gap has hindered the discovery of anti-persister and anti-VBNC therapeutics. The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify the molecular-level characteristics that portray persisters and VBNCs, and explore the methods facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies that eliminate both cell types. In this context, we will first generate a transposon or overexpression library for E. coli and screen for genes whose perturbation would impair both persister and VBNC formation using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and transposon-sequencing. To further map the underlying mechanisms that are relevant to an antibiotic tolerant state, we will determine transcriptome patterns of the strains which have received genetic perturbations eliminating the antibiotic tolerant states. The same methodology will be applied to an opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa to systematically explore its genetic basis of persistence and VBNC state. Altogether, these experiments will provide insights to develop novel approaches to perturb the ability of bacteria to form antibiotic tolerant states. In addition, this study would represent one of the seminal contributions to characterizing and distinguishing persister and VBNC formation mechanisms in P. aeruginosa.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY  Vascular stiffness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in diabetes and represents an  understudied, but potentially modifiable risk factor for death in the large and growing population of American  diabetics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic vascular stiffness are only recently coming  to light, and therapeutic targets remain elusive.    The apelin APJ signaling axis is a potentially targetable molecular pathway that is dysregulated in  diabetes and activation of which is associated with decreased vascular stiffness in humans and mice.  Importantly, preliminary data in apelin knockout mice suggests that this decreased stiffness may occur in part  through decreased vascular medial fibrosis. MicroRNA 29b (MiR 29b) protects against medial fibrosis by  translational repression of collagen and elastin transcripts, and its expression is regulated by canonical second  messengers of apelin APJ binding. Therefore, we hypothesize that diabetes decreases apelin/APJ  signaling, leading to a miR 29b ?dependent alteration in collagen and elastin expression in the  vascular media to cause increased vascular stiffness.    In Specific Aim1, I will use cultured vascular smooth muscle cells exposed to apelin and hyperglycemia  as well as specific inhibitors of canonical APJ signaling to elucidate the specific molecular mechanisms by  which apelin increases miR 29b expression in the vascular media.  In Specific Aim 2, I will use a mouse model of diabetes, the leptin knockout (db/db) mouse as well as  apelin knockout mice to assess the effect of in vivo modulation of miR 29b expression and apelin on diabetic  vascular stiffness as measured by ex vivo pressure myography. Specifically, I expect to demonstrate that miR  29b administration to apelin KO mice rescues their increase in vascular stiffness, and that in db/db mice, apelin  administration rescues vascular stiffness in a miR 29b dependent manner.     In Specific Aim 3, I will examine the regulation of these molecular actors in human diabetes by  measuring aortic expression of apelin, APJ, miR 29b and markers of vascular medial fibrosis in diabetic vs  non diabetic patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. This will confirm that the apelin  APJ miR 29b pathway is downregulated in human diabetes, making it a viable therapeutic target to reduce  diabetic vascular stiffness.  The proposed experiments will identify multiple putative therapeutic targets and provide a scaffold on  which to study multiple molecular pathways converging on vascular stiffness. As this represents one of the few  targetable disease entities in which intervention can prevent mortality and improve symptoms, this project has  the potential to contribute greatly to our treatment of diabetic cardiovascular disease.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek continuation of our IMSD program that focuses on preparing talented undergraduate scholars from underrepresented groups (URs) for later success in graduate school. The successful growth of our program is best illustrated by the fact that over the previous 3 funding cycles, there has been a progressive increase in the percentage of IMSD scholars entering PhD programs, now approaching 60% of all participants in IMSD III. Although the majority of IMSD scholars are recruited from a rich pool of KU UR students, the impact of this program is broadened by our partnership with a neighboring tribal college that allows a unique opportunity to recruit American Indians. IMSD IV proposes four levels of impact. Level I: The core of our program, preparing highly trained IMSD scholars from underrepresented groups for successful completion of PhD programs; Level II: enhancing underrepresented-student success and retention in the sciences at KU through supplemental instruction; Level III: building overall diversity at KU; and Level IV: disseminating successful approaches beyond the borders of KU. The training of IMSD scholars follows a thoughtfully organized stepwise plan that centers on the undergraduate research experience. The mentoring of our scholars will be provided by the faculty research mentor, program directors, the IMSD program coordinator, teaching postdoctoral fellows and IMSD peers (senior scholars). Innovative approaches in training include the formulation and use of an online Individual Development Plan (IDP) that extends beyond the traditional academic degree plan and requires scholars to carefully consider the requirements and training needed for later success in graduate school. We are developing a new performance-based rubric to assess the scholars' research skill development. We also incorporate in our mentoring a web video based mentoring system (Science Career Pathway) developed by KU IMSD that provides mentoring from peers and successful scientists in a format relevant to college students. All scholars complete seminars in topics ranging from responsible conduct of research to preparing highly competitive applications to graduate school and appropriate T-32 programs. Full institutionalization of the supplemental instruction, developed in IMSD II and III to promote student success in the sciences, will occur in IMSD IV. IMSD staff will develop new materials to increase the number of students who have benefitted from these enhancements to math and science curriculum. Publication of results from the successes of our program and uses of our Science Career Path mentoring system constitute the dissemination plan. Evaluation of measurable objectives for all four levels of the program will be carried out by an external evaluator with the assistance from the internal evaluation team. Evaluation and tracking procedures allow for periodic adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. Continuation of the KU IMSD will maintain the momentum and proven success in recruiting and preparing a diverse group of undergraduate IMSD scholars for subsequent completion of the PhD and entry into the scientific community.\",\n",
       " 'Project Abstract  Many psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, depression, and autism, are associated with disrupted sleep. Disrupted sleep may contribute to negative cognitive symptoms, as sleep is crucial for maintaining and restoring healthy brain function. In particular, the slow (0.1-1 Hz) oscillations characteristic of deep sleep are thought to play essential roles in the restorative functions of sleep, and these oscillations have complex spatial properties that may be important for their effects on cognition. However, determining how slow oscillations influence brain function has been challenging due to our current inability to measure slow oscillations with spatial precision throughout the whole brain.  This project exploits the recent development of accelerated multi-slice imaging methods to measure fast (>0.2 Hz) fMRI signals. This work is centered around an innovative use of accelerated fMRI with simultaneous EEG to directly measure slow oscillation dynamics throughout the human brain simultaneously, and use this information to create the first whole-brain maps of slow oscillations. We will first optimize imaging and analysis methods for localizing slow oscillations. We will then test a hypothesis for how slow oscillations affect cognitive function: namely, that spatially localized slow oscillations in cortex and thalamus lead to reorganized information transfer across cortical networks, and thereby influence cognitive function.  The candidate has expertise in systems neuroscience of arousal regulation, anesthesia pharmacology, electrophysiology, and signal processing, providing a strong foundation for conducting this advanced imaging study of sleep states. The K99 will provide necessary training in 1) functional and anatomical MRI; 2) simultaneous EEG-fMRI during sleep; and 3) human sleep neurophysiology. The research will take place at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center, a highly collaborative environment equipped with state-of-the-art facilities for neuroimaging. The primary mentor Prof. Bruce Rosen will provide mentorship in neuroimaging and in transitioning to an independent position. In addition, the co-mentor Prof. Robert Stickgold will provide training in sleep neurophysiology, as well as exposure to clinical contexts of how sleep is affected in psychiatric disorders, and how disrupted sleep can contribute to cognitive deficits. Additional advice from Dr. Jonathan Polimeni and Dr. Jeff Duyn on imaging and analysis techniques will ensure high-level training in these methodological approaches. This methodological and scientific training will enable the candidate both to successfully complete these aims and to develop an independent research program focused on the systems neuroscience of sleep and arousal regulation, how sleep circuits and sleep-modulating pharmaceutical agents influence cortical function, and how sleep deficits lead to disrupted cognition. The results of this research will contribute to improved methods for imaging dynamics in the human brain, and shed light on the effects of sleep deprivation, which have significant negative effects both on the general population and particularly in patients with psychiatric disorders.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this application is to establish a thematic, multidisciplinary Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) via the COBRE mechanism. This will be a self-sustaining research center focused on identifying the molecular causes of diseases and conditions that negatively impact the musculoskeletal system or interact with this system as part of their disease process. Successfully establishing this COBRE will spur the development of new and effective therapies for a broad range of conditions, including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, aberrant skeletal development, osteomyelitis, multiple myeloma, and cancer metastases to the bone. A key to the success of this Center will be the development of new independent investigators who are committed to team-based musculoskeletal research. To develop and operate this Center, the Administrative Core will establish the scientific and administrative infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of musculoskeletal researchers at UAMS and affiliated institutions and will oversee all organizational and budgetary aspects of Center development and function (Specific Aim 1). The Administrative Core will also implement a faculty development plan that will mentor four junior investigators to the point of independence, as measured by obtaining R01-level funding, and beyond (Specific Aim 2). The Administrative Core will support the growth of the Center by recruiting and promoting the development of new junior investigators to replace those that achieve independence via a pilot project program, the targeted recruitment of new investigators, and by effective Center evaluation (Specific Aim 3). These goals will be accomplished under the leadership of the Center Director who, with the support of experienced mentors and an Internal and External Advisory Committee, will guide four Project Leaders focused on musculoskeletal research to independence. The Administrative Core will also oversee the operation of three Research Cores providing state-of-the-art services to create new genetic models (Core B), perform specialized skeletal tissue analysis (Core C), and perform bioinformatic analyses of large molecular datasets (Core D). The overall success of this strategy will be gauged by achieving the following milestones within the first five years of Center funding: 1) three or more of the Project Leaders will successfully compete for NIH or federal R01-level research grant support to graduate to independent investigator status; 2) two to four new Project Leaders (and Mentors) will be selected and join the Center; 3) Project Leaders and other Center members will publish between 20 and 30 peer-reviewed publications; and 4) graduated Project Leaders and other members of the Center will be in the process of developing, or will have submitted, a center-level grant application, such as a P01 or P30.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) orchestrates protein folding and secretion and the unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains ER homeostasis. The UPR is mediated by three signal transduction pathways, controlled by the proteins PERK, IRE1?, and ATF6, that act to clear unfolded proteins from the ER. Sustained elevation of the UPR, or its insufficient activation, contributes to the pathology of diseases such as diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Osteoblasts are bone forming cells that secrete large amounts of collagen and have extensive ER. Moreover, humans and mice lacking a functional version of the PERK gene display several metabolic defects and have low bone mass. However, it is not clear whether the reduced bone mass is due to a decrease in the UPR in osteoblasts or in other cell types. Some osteoblasts become buried in new bone matrix and become osteocytes, which produce factors that control bone remodeling. Osteocyte death can induce factors that stimulate production of bone resorbing osteoclasts. In preliminary studies, we found that induction of ER stress in mice and osteocyte-containing bone cultures increased osteoclastogenic cytokine production, osteoclast number, and bone resorption. Conversely, in a mouse model of glucocorticoid excess, which causes bone loss in humans, we observed reduced expression of downstream mediators of the UPR. This evidence suggests that either excessive or insufficient UPR activation can lead to bone loss. Based on this, we propose the central hypothesis that components of the UPR play an essential role in osteoblast differentiation and function, and dysregulation of the UPR in cells of the osteoblast lineage contributes to pathological bone loss. To test this hypothesis, we will determine whether Perk plays an essential role in osteoblast physiology by conditionally deleting this gene from cells of the osteoblast lineage using Osx1-Cre transgenic mice (Aim 1). We will also determine the skeletal consequences of sustained elevation of the UPR in cells of the osteoblast-lineage by deleting the protein-folding co-chaperone ERdj4 specifically in these cells followed by a comprehensive analysis of the skeleton and osteoblast gene expression (Aim 2). Lastly, we will determine whether glucocorticoid excess inhibits bone formation in mice, in part, by suppressing UPR activation using UPR reporter mice treated with exogenous glucocorticoids and biochemical analyses of UPR pathways (Aim 3). The scientific theme of the proposed Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research is that genetic analysis of musculoskeletal diseases will support development of novel therapies for such conditions. The proposed studies are aligned with this theme and their successful completion may identify new therapeutic targets for common causes of osteoporosis. These studies will be supported by all three proposed COBRE research cores and the Project Leader will be mentored by a two-member team and other members of Center. Results produced during the first 2 years of the project will lead to the submission of an R01 grant application by the end of the second year of COBRE support.',\n",
       " 'SUMMARY Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the single largest viral cause of pediatric bronchiolitis and pneumonia, with a high worldwide mortality, and there is no safe and effective vaccine. Ever since the encounter with vaccine- enhanced disease (VED) during a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccination trial in the 1960s, it has been enormously challenging to impart both sufficient safety and efficacy in a single vaccine. For RSV-naÃ¯ve children, live-attenuated vaccines are an important focus, because inactivated and subunit vaccines are poor at inducing cell-mediated immunity which contributes to VED. Moreover, live vaccines can induce broad systemic and local immunity. Thus, for RSV-naÃ¯ve individuals a live vaccine approach is an attractive option, provided the vaccine itself is sufficiently safe and cannot revert to a more aggressive phenotype. It has recently been recognized that the viral fusion (F) protein is unstable and readily shifts to the post-fusion conformation during purification or vaccine preparation. As a result, a large proportion of vaccine-induced antibodies (Abs) target the post-fusion form, which is functionally obsolete. To avoid induction of anti- post- fusion F Abs, McLellan et al were able to genetically stabilize the pre-fusion form (referred to as FPRE), thereby greatly increasing neutralizing capacity of anti-F Abs, when given as a protein vaccine. However, subunit vaccines are deemed unsafe for the RSV-naÃ¯ve target population. Thus, to protect RSV-naÃ¯ve children there is a need to place the advantageous pre-fusion F concept in the context of a balanced immune response that does not cause VED, which could be achieved by expressing FPRE from a live-attenuated virus. However, stabilization of FPRE renders it non-functional and a virus solely expressing FPRE is not viable. We previously reported a baculovirus GP64 based complementation system that can overcome this problem, as it uniquely allows generation of infectious F-deleted or F-compromised viruses from cDNA in GP64-expressing cells. These GP64-pseudotyped viruses could be amplified to high titer and were significantly more temperature stable than wildtype RSV. Due to replacement of functional F with trans-complemented GP64, the viruses are infectious but self-limited and cannot spread beyond initially infected cells, thus constituting an attractive live-attenuated platform. We have in vivo preliminary data using a similar single-round RSV vaccine that suggests such vaccines are efficaceous. The goal of this proposal is to exploit the GP64 system to generate a live RSV which solely expresses the pre- fusion F form. Our hypothesis is that replacing the native, functional, F gene with a gene encoding a pre-fusion stabilized F in a live virus, will drive the anti-F response toward the pre-fusion F form, and will induce a balanced response that includes cell-mediated immunity and avoids VED. We will test this hypothesis through two aims: 1) Generate and in vitro characterize a live-attenuated RSV lacking a functional F copy and expressing instead a conformationally stabilized pre-fusion F; and 2) Characterize immune properties of RSV expressing FPRE in vivo to assess safety and efficacy. If successful, the vaccine will exceed previous formulations in inducing a broadly efficaceous yet safe immune response for the RSV-naÃ¯ve target population.',\n",

       " 'Approximately 15 million Americans suffer from asthma, which leads to about 4000 deaths per year, and is responsible for estimated annual total direct and indirect costs of $56 billion. Despite the existing treatments for asthma, predominantly combinations of inhaled ?2-agonists and corticosteroids (CSs), there remains a significant unmet medical need for new therapies which address two key issues: 1) approximately 10% of patients are insensitive to current medicines; and 2) a significant number of patients (up to 50%) have adherence challenges with the inhaled drugs, due to inhaler misuse, lack of use and/or side-effects. There is compelling evidence implicating T-helper 2 (Th2) cells in asthma via: i) the induction and maintenance of inflammation and ii) the progression to the morphological changes associated with chronic disease. Also, there is growing published support that acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase), a member of the chitinase family of hydrolases, contributes to the Th2-driven inflammatory responses, tissue injury and remodeling associated with diseases such as asthma. Hypothesis: We thus hypothesize that an oral AMCase inhibitor will alter the pattern of inflammation in CS-insensitive asthmatics, may augment the response to CSs in severe asthmatics and will also be effective in Th2-mediated asthma, as well as avoiding the adherence issues with inhaled medicines. Innovation: Our company (OncoArendi Therapeutics) initiated a Drug Discovery Program focused on developing potent and selective, orally active AMCase inhibitors for asthma and other Th2-associated diseases. After synthesizing and testing more than 500 compounds, we have selected a clinical candidate to progress into development for asthma. Our lead candidate OAT-889 is very selective, has high potency, excellent oral bioavailability in rodents, with long terminal half-life, low clearance and high volume of distribution, and activity in two standard models of asthma. In addition, OAT-889 has moderate plasma protein binding across species, no significant inhibition of CYP enzymes or hERG, and is negative in the Ames genotoxicity test. OAT-889 has first-in-class potential, with no known competition from other BioPharmaceutical companies. We propose to file an IND for this novel oral small molecule AMCase inhibitor as a critical step towards the clinical development of this innovative asset to treat moderate-to-severe asthma patients. The major goals of this Fast-track proposal are: Phase I. Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the effects of the clinical candidate, OAT-889, in a murine chronic model of asthma involving exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus, which is not sensitive to inhaled CSs. Phase II. Specific Aim 1: Translational medicine studies in human lung. Specific Aim 2: File an IND for OAT-889 after completing the standard IND-enabling studies. OAT-889 is the first of a new class of oral compounds, AMCase inhibitors, which have the potential to manage patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who are not adequately controlled by current medicines, while significantly improving treatment adherence compared to standard inhaled therapy.',\n",
       " 'Abstract:  Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a chronic disease that predictably leads to colorectal cancer if left untreated. Clinical trials have shown that COXIBs (selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors), a subclass of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that were originally developed to treat arthritis, effectively reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer in FAP patients. However, this class of drugs cannot be used clinically to treat FAP due to their severe systemic side effects including unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiac thrombus. Drug companies have had to withdraw the chemopreventive indication of approved COXIBs (i.e., celecoxib) from the market due to these serious side effects. In this application, we propose to develop recycled colon bioavailable (r-CB) drugs to localize the active COXIBs in the colon by targeting enterohepatic circulation (EHC) via structure modification, resulting in low systemic drug exposure and high colonic drug exposure, thereby reducing the systemic side effects without sacrificing their efficacy. In the preliminary study, we have synthesized a few compounds and identified one (GS1) that is a potent COX-2 inhibitor undergoing efficient EHC. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that COX-2 inhibitor GS1 can effectively prevent or slow down the process of colon carcinogenesis with low systemic exposure in animal models relevant to FAP. Our long-term goal is to develop highly active r-CB COXIBs for the prevention of colorectal cancer that have limited or no systemic side effects in FAP patients. To prove the feasibility of r-CB drugs, we will: (1) evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy and systemic exposure of GS1 using the Pirc rat model (Aim 1); and (2) identify the transporter(s) facilitating EHC and evaluate the impact of EHC on the drug distribution using cell culture and/or animal models (Aim 2). The successful completion of this project will allow us to demonstrate that r-CB drugs that are only bioavailable in the colon can be created. This would enable selective treatment or prevention of the colonic cancer without severe systemic side effects. In addition, this project will allow us to generate preliminary data for the preparation of an R01-level proposal. It is expected that the research community will use this approach to develop drugs for the treatment of other colonic diseases; especially those related to COX-2- mediated colon carcinogenesis.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary The GENERAL AIM of this proposal is to qualitatively advance knowledge on urinary metabolic phenotypes and biochemical pathways associated with the direct effect on blood pressure (BP) of high sodium (Na) intake and the inverse BP effect (BP reduction) of the DASH/OmniHeart- like eating pattern. To achieve this aim, we will identify and quantify key metabolites related to these contrasting BP influences, and use state-of-the-art chemometrics, statistical spectroscopy, computational network and pathway modeling tools to identify and map de novo pathways associated with Na-BP and DASH/OmniHeart-BP. We will then test and validate the INTERMAP derived metabolites and pathways using available data and samples from the INTERMAP China Prospective (ICP) Study, the Urinary Sodium Study (USS), and the OmniHeart Trial. The goal is to develop more focused and effective strategies for population- wide BP lowering through improved non-pharmacologic approaches, primarily nutritional, as well as to identify new targets for drug intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to identify urinary metabolites and associated pathways related to Na-BP and DASH/OmniHeart-BP, link these to dietary and other data, and with extensive validation in other cohorts, prospective and trial data.',\n",
       " 'Administering aerosols to the lungs via the nose, while convenient, is known to be challenging due to high aerosol depositional losses in the delivery system and extrathoracic airways. In the first phase of this project, we demonstrated that the new excipient enhanced growth (EEG) technique could significantly improve lung delivery efficiency of aerosols administered during non-invasive ventilation and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy. The EEG approach implements a small particle aerosol containing a hygroscopic excipient to reduce depositional loss in the delivery system, increase aerosol particle size in the airways, and target the site of deposition within the lungs. Using EEG, lung delivery efficiency values were increased from ~1-10% to ~80% together with improved targeting of the small tracheobronchial airways (30-40-fold dose increase) and reduced intersubject variability. These results were based on testing in realistic in vitro airway models and new whole-airway computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.  The goal of this translational project is to determine the in vivo lung delivery efficiency of EEG aerosols administered during HFNC therapy using a newly developed and optimized HFNC aerosol delivery unit. A new standalone HFNC therapy aerosol device (delivery unit) will be developed that can simultaneously generate and administer an EEG aerosol. Depositional loss of the medication in the new delivery unit and streamlined nasal cannula interface combined will be <10% of the nebulized dose. Radiolabeled conventional and EEG formulations for mesh nebulization will be developed for human subject testing. The expected lung delivery efficiency of 1-10% with a commercial system will be increased to 80% or greater with the new EEG clinical system. In the human subject study, SPECT-CT images of the lung deposition will be segmented using 2D and 3D approaches and compared with CFD predictions. To accomplish these project goals, the following Aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1. Develop a HFNC aerosol delivery unit for nose-to-lung aerosol administration and optimize performance using concurrent in vitro tests and whole-airway CFD simulations. Specific Aim 2. Characterize the in vitro performance of the radiolabeled aerosol generated using the EEG method and delivery unit and the standard of care method to establish human subject dosimetry. Specific Aim 3. Conduct human subject testing of the HFNC aerosol delivery unit and compare delivery efficiency with current standard of care. Validate whole-airway predictions of the CFD model, and further optimize device performance. Impact. This project will provide a new technique (EEG) and clinical platform (HFNC delivery unit) for high efficiency aerosol delivery, low intersubject variability, and targeted delivery within the lungs for improving the efficacy of existing and new inhaled medications administered using the convenient nose-to-lung route.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are highly prevalent (affecting over 15 million women annually in the United States), tend to recurrence and/or chronicity and are increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment. Recent work suggests a ?Lock and Key? paradigm in which UTI susceptibility is governed by complex interactions of dynamic host susceptibility determinants and diverse bacterial urovirulence potentials that are driven not only by gene content but also by differences in the expression and regulation of conserved functions. Further, catheterization of the urinary tract increases susceptibility to infection by bacteria that do not usually cause UTIs in immunocompetent people, including highly antibiotic resistant strains such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, a prominent member of the carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae. This proposal will assess the mechanisms by which urinary catheters affect acute UTI susceptibility and long-term pathophysiology in the urinary tract (UT). Short-term urinary catheterization increases the risk of UTI and other complications up to 80%, and prolonged catheterization increases the risk to 100%. In mouse models of catheter associated UTI (CAUTI), urinary catheterization itself results in the wounding of the bladder epithelium, leading to inflammation and fibrinogen release. Fibrinogen and other host proteins are deposited on catheters in both mice and human patients. Enterococcus, a common cause of CAUTI, binds this deposited fibrinogen via the EbpA adhesin to mediate catheter adherence, biofilm formation and UT colonization, even though Enterococcus cannot directly bind the catheter. This proposal tests the hypothesis that implanted catheters increase host susceptibility to UTI by diverse potential pathogens via wounding the uroepithelium, triggering inflammation and providing novel surfaces for bacterial binding. In addition, available data suggest that inflammation and epithelial wounding due to chronic cystitis remodels the bladder mucosa, rendering it more susceptible to subsequent infection. Continual wounding due to long-term catheterization may also result in bladder mucosal remodeling and increased infection susceptibility. This proposal aims to use histological, biochemical and genetic approaches in combination with representative mouse models and human clinical samples to: i) assess the effects of catheter implantation on infection susceptibility and determine host and bacterial factors important in CAUTI; ii) investigate the host proteins and diverse bacterial adhesins that mediate binding to and biofilm formation on implanted catheters and; iii) ascertain mucosal remodeling effects of prolonged foreign body residence in the UT. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the increased sensitivity to infection of the UT due to catheterization will give insights into the development of more effective therapies, which are sorely needed due to the spread of multidrug resistant uropathogens.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  The primary goal of the proposed research is to advance the quality of care provided to people with lower limb amputation (LLA) by developing a state-of-the-art, dynamic measurement system that can be incorporated into clinical practices, research studies, and electronic health record systems. Performance-based measurement of important health outcomes, like prosthetic mobility, is widely acknowledged as an important element of professional practice and a primary contributor to positive patient outcomes. Standardized performance-based measures are well suited to measuring clinical patients, but they are inhibited by a structure that requires a patient to complete a large number of tasks, many of which provide limited value to the clinical assessment. Modern measurement methods, which have been successfully applied to enhancing the quality and efficiency of patient-reported measures, can be extended to address inefficiencies in performance-based testing. In this project, we apply advances in psychometric modelling and computer technology to create a dynamic measurement system that targets the capabilities of each individual patient.  In Aim 1, we will develop a bank of tasks suited to measuring mobility of people with LLA in clinical settings. A large, diverse sample of 500 prosthetic limb users will be recruited in a national cross-sectional study to test candidate tasks. Results will be quantitatively analyzed using item response theory (IRT) to create a calibrated bank of performance tasks that can be targeted to patients with similar characteristics (eg, people with LLA due to diabetes) using fixed-length task sets, or targeted to individual patients using computerized adaptive testing (CAT). In Aim 2, we will conduct statistical simulations to maximize the efficiency of the CAT algorithm. We will use information from patient-report outcome measures to identify the first task and unique stopping rules to ensure patients with very high or very low mobility are not unnecessarily burdened. We will develop an application to allow clinicians and researchers to administer the measure, and software to facilitate integration into electronic health record systems. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the reliability, validity, and efficiency of the developed system for measuring mobility in people with LLA. A diverse sample of 100 prosthetic limb users will be recruited to participate in a repeated-measures study. We will compare results from the developed system to existing measures of mobility, balance, and physical function.  Successful completion of this project will provide a valid, reliable, interpretable, and efficient tool for measuring mobility outcomes in people with LLA and a model for enhancing performance-based measurement in other clinical populations.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract: Owing to the successful use of engineered microbial opsins to remotely control neuronal excitability at high spatiotemporal resolution, considerable new insights into the causal relationship between circuit activity and neuropsychiatric diseases have been obtained through optogenetic approaches. Existing optogenetic tools are primarily designed to manipulate the flow of ions, such as sodium, potassium and chloride, that support an electrogenic role in the brain of mammals. By contrast, calcium ion passing through voltage gated calcium (CaV) channels not only alters membrane potential but also functions as an indispensable messenger to regulate neuronal gene expression, synaptic transmission, neurite outgrowth and memory formation. CaV channels are also essential for cardiac and smooth contractility. CaV channels serve as emerging and attractive therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular diseases. However, noninvasive tools to directly and selectively photo-modulate the flow of calcium ion in neurons and cardiomyocytes are still limited. Another technical roadblock that faces the current in vivo optogenetics and optical neuromodulation is the inability of most existing tools to stimulate deep and wide within the brain without the use of invasive indwelling fiber optic probes. To tackle these two technical challenges, we propose to optically inhibit CaV channel activity by engineering light sensitivities into key CaV negative regulators, and in parallel, to develop bio-compatible nano-antennae-upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as a ?cordless? optogenetic platform to capture and convert low power, tissue-penetrant, near infrared radiation (NIR) into blue light. This nanoantenna will act as a light-delivery transducer to modulate voltage-gated calcium channels, as well as calcium-dependent activities in excitable tissues, with precise spatiotemporal control. We propose two specific aims to advance our platform to excitable cells by using neuronal cells as proof-of-concept. In Aim 1, we will develop new optogenetic tools to photo-control CaV channel function, and characterize the capacity of our first-generation UCNPs to act as ?nanoantenna?. In Aim 2, we will develop next generation UCNPs with high photoconversion efficiencies and enhanced biocompatibility. We anticipate that our NIR light-stimulable optogenetic platform will enable remote and noninvasive control of cell activities in excitable tissues, and permit modulation of their intricate inter- cellular interactions under both physiological and pathological conditions at large scale. Given the wide distribution and close involvement of CaV channels in multiple diseases, the techniques and tools that we develop can be broadly extended to interrogate other types of tissues across multiple systems. In summary, the proposed early-stage, cordless optogenetic technology is anticipated to overcome many of the limitations of current fiber optics-based optogenetic approaches, and will enable new and broad applications in both biomedical research and human health.',\n",
       " 'Abstract/Project Summary The overall goal of seeking a K Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to be a leading independent investigator in implementing interventions through web- and mobile-based technologies that address health disparities associated with diabetes and related diseases. Key objectives of the career development plan are to 1) gain experience with diabetes self-management; 2) gain experience with web-based technology and chronic disease; and 3) gain hands-on experience with the implementation and dissemination of interventions. The following is a description of the proposed research project: Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to macrovascular and microvascular health complications. African Americans have a greater burden of disease, worse health outcomes from diabetes and lower adherence to diabetes self-management goals. Novel approaches to delivering problem-solving skills training that improve diabetes self-management and CVD knowledge are needed. Decision-Making Education for Choices in Diabetes Every Day (DECIDE) (Hill-Briggs) is a problem-solving curriculum that is successful in improving adherence to self-management behaviors in African Americans. However, one limitation of DECIDE is the face to face application. Previous interventions which focus only on problem-solving do not involve the use of web-based technology. The proposed study will explore the translation of DECIDE into an effective web-based program (eDECIDE) for African American patients with uncontrolled diabetes. We hypothesize that eDECIDE can effectively be delivered. We will explore this through three AIMS: 1) To translate and design the DECIDE curriculum into a user-centered web-based program, eDECIDE; 2) To assess patient usability and satisfaction with eDECIDE design; 3) To test eDECIDE in a pilot 9-week randomized controlled trial (n=70), measuring change in HbA1c (primary outcome) and the following secondary outcomes: blood pressure, cholesterol, problem-solving skills, Diabetes and CVD Knowledge, Nutrition, and Diabetes Self-Care behaviors. To investigate our aims we will conduct a task analysis of the DECIDE curriculum, (wireframe architecture) followed by usability testing (website evaluation) and finally conduct a pilot, 9-week randomized controlled trial of eDECIDE. Relevance: Findings from the proposed application have potential to shed light on ways to improve HbA1c and enhance delivery of problem-solving skills training to improve diabetes self-management behaviors among African American populations.',\n",
       " 'Abstract  Giardia lamblia is the most common protozoan cause of diarrhea in the world. It infects ~500 million people worldwide, often resulting in nutrient malabsorption which can lead to physical and cognitive developmental defects in children. The infection is transmitted buy ingestion of cysts and the cyst wall contains large amounts of N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) polymer. The macrophage galactose-binding lectin (MGL) is the dominant lectin capable of recognizing GalNAc. Our hypothesis is that recognition of cyst wall material by MGL plays a significant role in determining the outcome of infections by modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Sepcifically, we hypothesize that MGL2 on dendritic cells recongizes parasite glycans leading to release of cytokines that promote production of the cytokine IL-17 by both innate and adaptive lymphocytes. IL-17 has recently been shown to be essential for resolution of Giardia infections. The balance between these competing forces will determine whether infections are resolved rapidly or become chronic. We will address these hypotheses by examining infections in mice lacking cells which express MGL2 or which lack MGL2 itself. We wille examine immune rsponses in vivo and in vitro to both cysts and trophozoites to determine the ability of cyst wall carbohydrates to activate immune cells through MGL2. Finally, bone marrow chimeras will be used to identify specific roles of cytokine production by MGL2+ cells.',\n",
       " 'Kidney stones are a common and recurrent disease affecting more than 10% of Americans in their lifetime, but the underlying pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. Since kidney stones occur predominantly during middle age and affect more men than women, US veterans are a high risk group for this disease. Current therapies have limited effectiveness, with only a modest reduction in stone recurrence rates, and there has been no real advancement in preventive therapy for many years. A breakthrough in understanding is clearly needed. Stones form as aggregates of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals with layers of organic material, principally urinary proteins, between the individual crystals, and these proteins likely play a critical role in stone formation. The role of proteins in stone formation is obscured by the large number of urinary proteins found within stone matrix. Comparison of urine proteomes from stone forming and normal individuals has failed to identify critical protein differences to date, but our recent Preliminary Data comparing the relative abundances in proteins in CaOx stone matrix to their urinary abundances has highlighted 2 small subsets of proteins that are likely to be key proteins, specifically including both highly anionic and highly cationic proteins. Such a combination of proteins suggests a role for polyanion-polycation aggregates in triggering stone formation, because we have previously shown that such aggregates stimulate CaOx crystal nucleation and aggregation. Therefore, we hypothesize that the relative abundance of proteins critical to the stone forming process will be increased in CaOx stone matrix compared to that seen in freshly voided urine from the same patient, specifically including both highly anionic and cationic proteins. While the proposed experiments will not elucidate the mechanism whereby these specific proteins become enriched in CaOx stone matrix, confirming the presence of this specific protein mixture in a large number of stones is necessary before mechanistic based studies exploring our suggested link between protein aggregation and stone formation are relevant. The proposed work will identify and characterize key proteins in stone formation in two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will confirm enrichment of key proteins in stone matrix using quantitative mass spectrometry to determine the relative abundance of proteins in stone matrix and urine samples obtained from 40 CaOx stone forming patients. In Specific Aim 2, the relative abundances of key proteins in urine under stable health conditions will be compared between our stone former panel and a matching normal population to test for the expected increase in key protein abundance in stone former urine. Immunoblot techniques will be used to circumvent problems associated with quantitative mass spectrometry characterization of low abundance proteins. Identification of key proteins associated with CaOx stone formation represents a new paradigm in stone research that can direct future mechanistic studies on protein triggers of stone formation, and hopefully inspire new therapeutic strategies.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary More than 50% of adults treated for diabetes, hypertension, or lipid disorders have suboptimal medication adherence, a prominent barrier to continued improvement in chronic disease care in the United States. Primary care providers (PCPs) often fail to identify medication nonadherence and/or have insufficient time and training to address underlying reasons for it. In this project, we propose a patient-centered and technology-driven strategy to identify patients with adherence issues and apply a team approach to help them achieve evidence- based personalized goals for glucose, blood pressure, or lipids. This intervention extends the use of a widely available clinical decision support (CDS) infrastructure to support a model of care that, for the first time outside of a fully integrated care environment, will integrate retail pharmacists within the primary care team. The intervention relies on a continuous health informatics loop to do the following: (a) identify high-risk patients with adherence problems at the point of care by expanding the capability of an electronic medical record (EMR)-linked CDS to capture pharmacy claims data and measure adherence; (b) establish and maintain an auto-populating up-to-date registry of patients identified for proactive pharmacist outreach at retail pharmacy locations; (c) implement a pharmacist outreach strategy based on an information-motivation-behavioral framework recommended by the World Health Organization with demonstrated ability to influence adherence across a variety of clinical applications; and (d) coordinate care and adherence information by incorporating pharmacist assessment and action plans into CDS at subsequent office encounters. The intervention was conceptualized and designed with extensive input from PCPs and in collaboration with pharmacy leaders to ensure efficient integration with existing clinic staff and workflows. We will test the effectiveness of this intervention using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 20 primary care clinics with approximately 50,000 adults with suboptimally controlled diabetes, hypertension, or lipid disorders. We will evaluate intervention impact on objective measures of adherence (proportion of days covered) and changes in hypertension control, glycemic control, and statin use. We will assess health care costs and long-term cost-effectiveness using microsimulation modeling, and in secondary analysis, assess intervention impact on primary nonadherence, 10-year cardiovascular risk, the care experience from the provider, patient, and key stakeholder perspectives, and on patient-reported medication adherence measures. This project builds upon previous National Institutes of Health funded research conducted by our team and (a) extends the capabilities of EMRs already used in the care of tens of millions of Americans, (b) electronically integrates pharmacists within the primary care team, (c) has the potential to significantly improve chronic disease care and translate massive investments in health information systems into tangible health benefits for large numbers of patients.',\n",
       " 'Abstract With the advent of personalized cancer medicine, mutations in tumors can be paired with targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, even the most potent TKI fail to eradicate all cancer cells. Subsequently, tumor-repopulating cells within minimal residual disease (MRD) contribute to patient relapse. The application of Abl-kinase inhibitors to the BCR/ABL oncoprotein in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a paradigm for personalized medicine. TKI therapy in CML leads to long lasting therapeutic benefit; however, MRD remains and can eventually evolve to blast crisis. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the failure of TKI to eradicate CML MRD are not known, growth factor signals are suspected to replace the TKI- disabled oncoprotein survival signals. We have determined that c-Fos and Dusp1 are critical for growth-factor- mediated TKI resistance. Both genetic and chemical inhibition of Dusp1 and c-Fos render CML exquisitely sensitive to TKI, and cure a mouse model of CML. Overall, our published and preliminary data suggests that expression levels of c-Fos and Dusp1 determine the threshold of TKI efficacy during chronic CML disease. Extending this line of investigation, the proposed research will determine whether c-Fos and Dusp1 are necessary and sufficient for the evolution of CML to blast crisis, and whether c-Fos and Dusp1 levels determine response to TKI in blast crisis. Next, we hypothesize that Fos and Dusp1 signals converge upon oncogenically-activated enhancers. We propose that Fos-Jun AP-1 complexes facilitate oncogenically active enhancers, while in the absence of c-Fos and Dusp1 signals, Jun-JunD AP-1 complexes predominate but do not support tumor maintenance. Specifically, we will molecularly link c-Fos-Jun AP-1 and Dusp1 activity to global enhancer chromatin dynamics. Moreover, we will exploit chromatin-embedded target-gene-reporter alleles to provide a detailed analysis of functionally-relevant downstream genes at a single-cell level in primary CML cells. The proposed work is expected to delineate the necessity of c-Fos and Dusp1 in CML-blast-crisis TKI sensitivity, as well as to provide deep molecular insight into the mechanisms underlying blast crisis and cytokine-mediated TKI resistance. We expect that this information will be informative not only for CML and blast crisis, but also the broad group of tyrosine-kinase oncoprotein-driven tumors that are not cured by TKI.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Youth mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, concussion) is a public health problem in the United States. Youth are felt to be particularly at risk for adverse outcomes from additive injury during recovery from mTBI. Thus, a critical aspect of care is determining when a child has recovered from mTBI such that a child can be medically cleared to return to sports and other high risk recreational activities without increased risk for adverse short- or long-term outcomes. While mTBI is defined as a physiological brain injury, current clinical measures for determining medical clearance to return to play after mTBI are not directly tried to brain physiology. The overall goal of this project is to evaluate markers of brain physiology in youth medically cleared to return to play after mTBI and how these markers relate to adverse events over the year following medical clearance. Specifically, we will investigate whether youth who have been medically cleared from mTBI by experts using the current gold-standard of clinical assessments show more subtle motor signs and/or anomalous functional brain connectivity compared to peers who have never had a mTBI and how long these findings persist. We will also evaluate whether motor and imaging findings predict rate of re-injury (musculoskeletal or mTBI) or clinically significant changes in emotional or cognitive functioning or health-related quality of life over the year following medical clearance. The aims of this project are to 1) evaluate whether youth medically cleared after mTBI show more subtle motor signs on a clinically-feasible measure at medical clearance and 3 and 12 months later, 2) evaluate for between-group differences in functional connectivity of resting state (default mode and dorsal attention) networks with premotor and motor brain regions at medical clearance and 3 and 12 months later, 3) determine if subtle motor signs are associated with functional brain connectivity in youth medically cleared after mTBI, and 4) evaluate the relationship between motor and imaging findings and occurrence of adverse events over the year following medical clearance. We will evaluate 70 youth aged 10-17 within 3 weeks of being medically cleared as recovered from mTBI and will re-evaluate the same youth 3 and 12 months later. We will similarly evaluate 70 age- and sex-matched youth who have never had a mTBI at three time points, baseline and 3 and 12 months later. At each time point we will compare groups with respect to motor subtle signs and functional connectivity of the dorsal attention network and default mode network with premotor and primary motor regions in the brain, both at rest and during a motor task. We will evaluate whether anomalous functional connectivity patterns in the mTBI group are associated with the presence of subtle motor signs. Lastly, we evaluate the relationship between motor and imaging findings and occurrence of re-injury or clinically significant change in functioning over the year following medical clearance. This project will help determine the adequacy of current clinical measures for evaluating medical clearance after youth mTBI and will set the stage for devising and evaluating strategies to reduce short- and long-term risks related to youth mTBI.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY  Improved control over synovial inflammation is anticiapted to slow bone erosion and reduce the risk of fractures and pain. However, even potent anti-inflammatory strategies such as blockade of TNF or IL6R, only show limited bone repair, suggesting that suppressing inflammation is insufficient to restore osteo-immune balance. Some current and emerging therapies succeed in slowing erosion by suppressing osteoclast activity, but fail to significantly stimulate bone formation. Further, these biologics are not targeted for accumulation at inflammed joints, thus are administered systemically, enhancing the likelihood of serious infection. For therapeutics to succeed in promoting bone repair, they likely must balance levels and activity of several proinflammatory cells to disrupt their interaction with osteoclasts, and promote osteoblast maturation or activity. Thus a critical unmet need for inflammatory bone loss is an intervention that can restore eroded bone through rebalancing immune:bone cell homeostasis in order to reduce fracture risk and improve quality of life for patients. Recent data points to a novel use for cytokine Interleukin-27 (IL-27) as a regulator of immune and bone cell balance, as it reduces osteoclastogenesis and promotes osteoblast proliferation and maturation. Also, IL-27 suppresses activities of immune and synovial cells mediating the onset and maintenance of inflammation and also has anti-angiogenic activity. Current strategies for delivering recombinant (r)IL-27 are systemic and lack specificity to immune or bone cells, and moreover are unable to sustain therapeutic effects over time due to rapid clearance. We propose to examine whether a targeted IL-27, delivered using a sustained expression system, will be effective in promoting bone repair and reducing inflammation in joints using a collagen-antibody induced arthritis (CAIA) model. Intraarticular sonoporation gene delivery (sonodelivery) will transfer into the joints a nanoplex of polymer and plasmid DNA encoding targeted IL-27 to reduce inflammation and promote bone repair. Our hypothesis is that optimizing delivery and targeting of IL-27 to joints will facilitate endogenous bone repair by re-balancing osteo-immune homeostasis.  To test this hypothesis, we propose 1) To achieve therapeutic levels of cytokine in joints, we will optimize IL-27 intra-articular sonodelivery; 2) To enhance cytokine retention in bone and promote endogenous bone repair, we will promote ligand-mediated targeting of IL-27 to bone cells or matrix, and 3) To enhance cytokine retention at the pannus and synovial lining and facilitate bone repair, we will promote ligand-mediated targeting of IL-27 to inflammatory and immune cells. We anticipate that this simple sonodelivery strategy will provide an efficient means to restore eroded bone in articulations affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA). IL-27 is unique in its ability to simultaneously inhibit inflammation and promote bone repair. This approach is exciting in that we envision applications across numerous conditions characterized by bone loss.',\n",
       " 'Abstract  An enduring problem for alcohol and drug abuse treatment is relapse following quit attempts. Typical animal models of relapse using operant self-administration techniques produce abstinence by withholding alcohol or drug reinforcement (i.e., extinction). Next, animals are exposed to drug, drug cues, or drug contexts to induce relapse. It is well known that drug and non-drug reinforcers interact, and treatments providing alternative non-drug reinforcers have been very successful. Unfortunately when non-drug reinforcers are discontinued, relapse is very common. More generally, some sources of relapse outside of formal treatment might be characterized as involving alternative-reinforcement loss (e.g., changes in social or vocational circumstances). Because typical animal models of relapse do not examine the role of loss of alternative non-drug reinforcement, our laboratory developed the resurgence model of relapse to alcohol seeking. In this model, self-administration is established and then suppressed via extinction while an alternative non-drug reinforcer is made available. Relapse to alcohol seeking then occurs when responding for the non-drug reinforcer is also extinguished. But, a common criticism of typical animal models of relapse, including the resurgence model, is that abstinence is achieved by extinguishing self-administration?a feature that does not correspond to the human condition. Rather, it appears that escalating negative consequences encountered as a result of continued use are a major contributor. Accordingly, increasing effort is being directed at using negative consequences to suppress alcohol and drug seeking in animal models of relapse. Such methods have been successfully applied to study relapse of alcohol seeking induced by an alcohol-associated context (i.e., renewal). The goal of this R21 Exploratory/Developmental grant is to develop a behavioral procedure for use as an animal model of relapse to alcohol seeking induced by loss of alternative non-drug reinforcement following the use of escalating negative consequences to generate alcohol abstinence. By developing a version of the resurgence procedure using escalating negative consequences to suppress alcohol seeking, the proposed research could result in a more appropriate animal model for future examinations of behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms of relapse to alcohol seeking. Finally, by using both male and female rats the project will provide important information about potential sex differences in sensitivity of alcohol seeking to escalating negative consequences and the availability and then loss of alternative non-drug reinforcement.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  Atantares Corp. is seeking funding to develop a standardized foundation of thrombosis evaluation, driven through the principle of unification of standard laboratory and specialized hemostasis testing, inclusive of a diversity of tests such as thromboelastography (TEG), PT/APTT, multiple electrode aggregometer etc., with the potential for iterative advance and multiplexing. Clinical realization of such a platform is far from the mere addition of various tests into a single unit, but transformative, particularly in the pediatric cases where innate diversity in hemorrhagic and thrombotic status is juxtaposed diversity in disease and treatment. Flexible platforms are required. Equally important, sensor miniaturization through our MEMS/microfluidic approach significantly reduces required blood volume (test and dead-space) to perform these various assays, making it ideal for pediatric patients. With deep expertise in MEMS technology, Atantares Corp has designed and is reducing to practice miniaturized and accurate modules of a diversity of hemostasis assays that can be used in isolation, in serial, or in parallelizable fashion at a fraction of the cost and footprint of current stand-alone systems. This technology also synergizes closely with the academic mission of Dr. Kolandaivelu who has examined in detail, the patient specific underpinnings of patient-specific thrombotic events following endovascular manipulations and in an effort to better understand the blood-borne contributors to risk, developed multi-parameter methods of mapping an individual?s hemostatic state in high definition.  Availability of a modular tool can interface directly into existing workflows and provider preferences, at the same time, being leveraged to cost-effectively and systematically build out the needed evidence-base for new applications despite diverse pediatric scenarios (innate variability, ECMO, CHD, arrhythmias, hemophilias, coagulopathies, NICU settings, etc.).  In the scope of this SBIR program, Atantares Corp. will demonstrate the key advantages of MEMS/microfluid technology in functional global hemostasis assays through two specific aims that seek to 1) Create high accuracy MEMS sensors for functional hemostasis assessment (exemplified herein as a uTEG unit; note, TEG is exemplary of a complex module with growing clinical value); as well as 2) Global assay optimization to maximize signal:noise at minimal test volume.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common intraocular tumor in adults and accounts for approximately 5% of all melanomas. UM metastasizes primarily to the liver in 50% of patients, and currently there are no suitable treatment options. In contrast to most cutaneous melanomas, which contain mutations in BRAF or NRAS, ~90% of all uveal melanomas contain activating mutations in either GNAQ or GNA11, which code for the G?q and G?11 subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. These two proteins are 90% homologous at the amino acid level and stimulate common signaling pathways. The activating mutations are almost always seen at the Q209 or R183 residues and render G?q/11 constitutively active when bound to GTP due to the loss of its intrinsic GTPase activity. Introduction of the GNAQ-Q209L mutant, but not wild-type GNAQ, into human or mouse melanocytes results in anchorage-independent growth and gives rise to heavily pigmented tumors in vivo. G?q/11 is involved in many downstream signaling pathways and its constitutive activity in UM leads to an increase in the activation of MAPK, Akt and the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, which stimulates the transcription of growth promoting genes. We believe that it would be advantageous to directly inhibit oncogenic G?q/11 and prevent the activation of these various cell proliferating pathways. To this end, we have tested the compound QIC, known to specifically inhibit wild type G?q/11, and found that is also capable of inhibiting oncogenic G?q/11 found in UM. Based on these results, we hypothesize that we can use G?q/11 inhibitors such as QIC to provide a better mechanistic understanding of the role that oncogenic G?q/11 plays in UM. To test this hypothesis, we will: 1) further characterize the mechanism by which G?q/11 specific inhibitors inhibit oncogenic G?q/11 proteins in vitro; 2) assess the effects of G?q/11 inhibition on downstream signaling in uveal melanoma cells; and 3) determine the effect of G?q/11 inhibition on uveal melanoma cell growth and migration. Taken together, these studies will enable a better mechanistic understanding of the role of G?q/11 in uveal melanoma and set the stage for the use of G?q/11 inhibitors in animal models.',\n",

Rev. Stat. Â§81-601). This research will use existing available data and wil identify new data sources in order to collect, analyze, and interpret surveillance data, putting a special emphasis on underserved, high risk groups such as minorities, young workers, older workers, and workers in high risk industries and occupations. We will collect all 21 occupational health indicators which have been identified by the NIOSH-States Occupational Health Surveillance Work Group. These indicators are specific measures of health or risk status (i.e. the occurrence of a health event or of factors associated with that event) among specific working populations. To further enhance surveillance for reportable conditions associated with workplace exposures, we will implement a surveillance system incorporating investigation and analysis of occupational poisoning or illness due to exposures to pesticides, lead, and other chemicals prioritized by our stakeholders. We will generate and communicate information with our partners to guide interventions and develop recommendations for prevention through making referrals, disseminating data and findings, and conducting educational outreach. In addition to surveillance activities, our program will maintain existing relationships and build new collaborations with local, state, and national stakeholders to further integrate occupational health into mainstream public health. An Advisory Committee consisting of state leaders in occupational health and safety will be convened to prioritize program activities and provide input on emerging issues in Nebraska.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY  Adolescence is a vulnerable time period in which drug use can have lasting negative consequences into adulthood. However, the biology underlying this vulnerability, and how drugs modify the brain during adolescence, is unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear if males and females are equally vulnerable to drug use during adolescence, and if their vulnerability is due to the same molecular processes. One critical cell type that has been implicated in playing a role in this adolescent critical period is the resident immune cells of the brain, microglia. This project will explore the role of microglia in a brain region critically influenced by drugs of abuse, the nucleus accumbens (NAc), in male and female rats. To that end, I will first characterize what molecular processes to which microglia contribute that shape the development of the NAc during adolescence. Building upon this, I will next assess how adolescent drug use modifies function of microglia in these natural processes. Finally, I will determine the behavioral relevance of these observations by targeting microglia-dependent processes previously identified during adolescent NAc during drug use. Moreover, because all experiments will be performed in both male and female rats, this project is poised to determine if there is a sex-dependent regulation of molecular processes vulnerable to drug use. I expect this project to have several novel implications by bridging three bodies of research that are as yet considered disparate: (i) the molecular processes underlying vulnerability to addiction, (ii) neuroimmune responses to drugs of abuse, and (iii) the biology of relapse after long periods of abstinence.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The stability and plasticity of synapses are both important for cognitive functions. Plasticity is necessary for learning, while stably formed synapses are believed to encode for long term memory. Yet it is unclear how neurons can maintain this delicate balance and achieve both stability and plasticity in synapses just a few microns apart. Clearly, a high level of compartmentalization is required, which makes polarity proteins ideal candidates to function in this capacity, as they serve to separate and maintain distinct membrane domains. Indeed, we previously showed that a class of polarity proteins called Par (partitioning defective) proteins plays a key role in dendritic spine morphogenesis, with Par1, Par3 and Par6 important for this process. Interestingly, our preliminary studies show that most of the spines in mature neurons are dominated by Par3 and Par6, whereas a smaller fraction of spines are dominated by Par1. This distribution pattern resembles that of Par proteins in developing zygotes and epithelial cells, where Par1 and the Par3/6 complex show opposite localization by mutually excluding each other from their respective domains. Furthermore, our previous studies suggest that Par3 and Par6, which form a complex with atypical PKC (aPKC), promote spine stability and maturation, whereas our preliminary results suggest that Par1 promotes spine plasticity. These data raise the exciting possibility that the Par3/6 complex and Par1 regulate the balance between stability and plasticity of spines, with Par3/6-dominant spines being more stable and Par1-dominant spines being more plastic. We plan to test this overarching hypothesis through two aims. In aim1, we will test the hypothesis that Par1 promotes synaptic plasticity and that plasticity is maintained by increasing the dynamics of the PSD scaffold and by excluding the Par3/6 complex. In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the Par3/Par6/aPKC complex promotes synaptic stability and that stability is maintained in part by excluding Par1 from the spines. We will utilize advanced molecular imaging techniques, including FRET, FRAP, fluorescent light-inducible proteins (FLIPs) and 2-photon glutamate uncaging. In addition, we will use 2-photon imaging in live mice to directly test our hypothesis in behaving animals. We will combine these imaging approaches with biochemical analysis as well as electrophysiology. This interdisciplinary approach will allow us to gain fundamental insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of synaptic stability and plasticity. Moreover, multiple lines of evidence are pointing to an important role for Par polarity proteins in neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Thus, our studies will provide mechanistic insight into synaptic plasticity and stability and may shed light on several devastating abnormalities that affect the human brain.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to support the PI?s development into an independent patient-oriented researcher with expertise in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and B cell biology. The PI will be mentored in all aspects of the proposal and receive training in systems biology approaches to human immunology research. Candidate - The PI holds MD and PhD degrees, has completed internal medicine residency and allergy/immunology fellowship at Mount Sinai Medical Center, and has been appointed Assistant Professor in Department of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. He has joined the laboratory of Dr. Charlotte Cunningham-Rundles and his preliminary work defined the immunological characteristics of CVID non-infectious complications. Elucidating pathogenesis of these complications is the focus of this proposal. Research ? CVID is the most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency. Its greatest morbidity and mortality results from non-infectious complications, namely autoimmunity (AI) and lymphoid hyperplasia (LH). The PI has previously detailed the cellular characteristics of pulmonary LH underlying interstitial lung disease (ILD) in these patients and defined clinical and laboratory associations of these complications. Recently, the PI found B cell activating factor (BAFF) elevated in the CVID patients with progressive AI and LH and the cytokine to be produced locally in the lungs of patients with ILD. Also, BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) expression and signaling is localized to follicles within LH, B cell maturation is most profoundly arrested in CVID patients with AI and LH, and apoptosis resistance of the persisting immature B cell subsets is mediated by BAFF. We hypothesize that AI and LH result from excessive BAFF-R signaling in immature B cell subsets in CVID. Career Development - The primary mentor (Dr. Cunningham-Rundles) is the David S. Gottesman Professor of Immunology at Mount Sinai and is an international authority on CVID. She runs the NIH-funded lab in which the PI will be based and directs the large clinical immunology practice from which study subjects will be recruited. Co-mentor Dr. Andrea Cerutti is an expert in T cell-independent activation of B cells via cytokines such as BAFF and is a Professor of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Additional advisory committee members are respected investigators with diverse expertise that will supplement the candidate?s research mentorship and career development. The candidate will also benefit from the collaborative research environment of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and complete coursework in bioinformatics and systems biology. Synopsis ? Drawing upon a focused research approach, expert mentorship, and a strategic educational plan, this proposal details a 5 year training program for an academic career in primary immunodeficiency and human B cell biology. At the conclusion of training, the PI will be positioned to become an independent physician scientist with expertise in CVID, BAFF biology, and high throughput human immunology research methods.',\n",
       " \"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with intracellular aggregation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn). However, the molecular mechanism of aSyn aggregation is not well understood. Our hypothesis is that alteration of essential interactions of aSyn during its translation (when it is still in the process of synthesis) leads to its misfolding and aggregation triggering initiation of the disease process. These changes of interactions can be triggered by a mutation (familial PD) or by defects in binding factors (sporadic PD). This hypothesis is supported by our experimental studies conducted on several proteins associated with human diseases: granulin (frontotemporal dementia), CFTR (cystic fibrosis), prolactin (infertility), and also by the recent discovery of a novel pathway of translational regulation, RAPP, that sensors quality of nascent chains during translation. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Aim 1: To identify aSyn interacting partners during translation in health and disease. We will use advantage of the recently developed unique approach iPINCH to identify the interacting proteins for wild-type and mutated (A30P, E46K, A53T) aSyns. Aim 2: Use a candidate approach to test involvement of folding, targeting and protein quality control factors in aSyn expression and folding. Recent studies demonstrate that ribosome-associated chaperones, chaperonins and components of RAPP pathway interact with nascent chains during translation. We will test their involvement in the expression and folding of wild-type and mutated aSyns by their RNAi knockdowns in cultured human cells. This project will lead to better understanding of the molecular mechanism of aSyn aggregation and identification of potential pharmacological targets for the disease treatments.\",\n",
       " \"Recent reports identified hippocampal area CA2 as the center of a new hippocampal synaptic circuit essential for social learning, linked to autism and schizophrenia. Unlike the classic dentate gyrus-CA3-CA1 hippocampal circuit, little is known about area CA2. New reports of CA2's role in social learning provide a compelling link between this brain region and these psychiatric diseases. Therefore, understanding signaling proteins and mechanisms in hippocampal neurons is key to understanding their roles in human neuro-pathophysiology. We reported that RGS14 is highly enriched in CA2 pyramidal neurons of adult mouse, monkey and humans. We reported that RGS14 is a scaffolding protein that integrates Gi, ERK, and Ca++ signaling pathways essential for synaptic plasticity. Moreover, we discovered that RGS14 is critically important as a natural suppressor of synaptic plasticity in CA2 neurons but not CA1. RGS14-KO mice exhibit a marked and unexpected reinstatement of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA2 neurons paired with an enhancement of hippocampal- based learning and memory, with no differences in other behaviors. RGS14 also blocks LTP in CA1 neurons when introduced, indicating it engages signaling pathways common to both CA2 and CA1 neurons. These findings highlight the importance of understanding cellular mechanism(s) whereby RGS14 regulates synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. While most of what we know about RGS14 relates to regulation of postsynaptic signaling (Gi, ERK and Ca++) at dendritic spines, we also found that RGS14 localizes to various subcellular compartments including the nucleus. Within monkey brain, we show a subpopulation of native RGS14 localizes to the nuclei of neurons. Consistent with this, RGS14 contains both a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and export sequence (NES) that enables it to shuttle in-out of the nucleus. Remarkably, we identified rare human variants of RGS14 (L504Q, R507Q) that alter the NES site resulting in RGS14 accumulation in the nucleus. This observation, along with the fact that RGS14 is a natural nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, beg the question: what is RGS14 doing in the nuclei of neurons? Our studies here show that native RGS14 localizes to the nuclei of host cells in close proximity to open DNA and active RNA Polymerase II. Based on this, we hypothesize that RGS14 serves a key role in the nuclei of hippocampal neurons, possibly as a synapse- to-nucleus co-regulator of transcribed genes important for synaptic plasticity. Therefore, the goals of these exploratory studies are to: AIM 1: Determine the effects of RGS14 and nuclear localizing human variants of RGS14 on synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. AIM 2: Identify RGS14 binding partners and their signaling roles in the nuclei of hippocampal neurons. AIM 3: Determine the effects of RGS14 and nuclear localizing RGS14 variants on gene transcription in hippocampal neurons. !\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Part C The aim of this project is to implement and evaluate a best practice Urologic Management Protocol for the Preservation of Renal Function (UPPF) in the Newborn/Young Child with Spina Bifida. The goal of the protocol is to develop standardized and effective urologic management in infants and young children with spina bifida, to preserve kidney function, lay the groundwork for long term continence and optimize long term health and well-being. It is estimated that 70,000 people in the United States are currently living  with spina bifida. The majority of patients with spina bifida experience urologic complications related to their condition, including incontinence and possibly renal damage. Over the past several decades, significant advancements have been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in children, which has allowed for earlier, more proactive therapeutic interventions aimed at the prevention of renal deterioration. Renal failure has historically been the leading cause of mortality in patients with myelomeningocele (MMC) followed through adulthood, reportedly accounting for a third of deaths. The significant impact of contemporary management with proactive urodynamic investigation, clean intermittent catheterization, antibiotic prophylaxis and anticholinergic therapy in children with MMC has shown a marked reduction in the rate of overall renal parenchymal damage. This project is innovative as it is a long term prospective study to test and evaluate the use of a standardized urologic management protocol for patients with spina bifida, beginning in the neonatal period. The data gathered through this project will provide researchers and clinicians with a robust database to test a systematic urologic protocol and to examine the long term urologic status of the population, enabling the development of evidence based clinical interventions to improve care outcomes and quality of life. Project objectives include outreach and education to CHLA faculty and staff, recruitment of 5-10 newborns per year from our Neonatal and Infant Critical Care Unit, implementation of the urologic protocol and collection and submission of data to the CDC, investigation of the effects of a standardized workflow on patient adherence and overall renal outcomes, assessment of parent and staff satisfaction with the urologic protocol, participation in research with other sites, and dissemination of findings.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract A considerable body of evidence implicates type I interferons (IFNs) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, the ?interferon signature? does not address the source and the key pathogenic type I IFNs in SLE, making it challenging to design effective precision medicine for SLE. We propose the novel hypothesis that it is the endogenous production of IFN? by B cells that plays a defining role in shaping the autoantibody response and disease activity in a substantial subset of patients with SLE. We have found, in humans and mice, that the transitional (Tr) stage of B-cell development is characterized by heterogeneity in IFN? expression at the single- cell level. Our preliminary data further suggest that: (i) Tr B cells with high endogenous production of IFN? undergo strong IFN? autocrine signaling and changes in the transcriptome signature in a manner that supports RNA/RNP-associated TLR7 responses. This imprinted signature promotes subsequent survival and development of RNP-reactive B cells including their differentiation into long-lived memory B cells; and (ii) Anti- dsDNA autoAb producing cells are derived from Tr cells that do not express high levels of endogenous IFN? expression; however, high levels of endogenous IFN? in memory B cells play a critical role in the differentiation of short-lived anti-dsDNA memory B cells. The model is supported by compelling preliminary data including analyses of PBMCs from SLE patients that indicated significantly higher IFN? expression in B cells from SLE patients with renal involvement and significantly higher expression of intracellular IFN? in B cells from female African-American (AA) SLE patients as compared with non-AA patients and healthy controls. In Aim 1, we will establish if lupus flare is associated with increases in IFN?hi memory B cells and if this phenotype is more common in AA SLE patients. High-throughput single-cell transcriptome analysis coupled with state-of-the-art computational analysis will be used to identify transcriptional signatures in DNA- and RNA-reactive B cells to refine this marker; to establish if, as predicted, there is commonality between the RNP-reactive Tr and memory B cell transcriptome; and to identify the association of enhanced IFN? signaling with stage-specific dysregulation of downstream pathways. Functional and target-specific analysis of sorted human PBMCs will then be used to determine if endogenous B-cell IFN? and its downstream pathways are essential for RNA- vs DNA-ligand mediated Tr and memory B-cell activation and survival. In Aim 2, we will use the same approaches in the BXD2 lupus model and BCR transgenic mice to determine if endogenous IFN? is essential for, and differentially regulates, anti-RNP and anti-DNA B cell development in vivo. This hypothetical model does not negate the contributions of other cells and factors to the pathogenesis of SLE but reframes the current paradigm. The data generated will provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of SLE, identify novel therapeutic targets and provide the basis for development of precision medicine-guided approaches to utilization of currently available therapies in a significant subset of patients.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Depression takes an enormous toll on individual and economic health. Although current antidepressant therapies provide relief for some individuals, many patients are inadequately treated which can lead to suicide. Thus, there is desperate need to identify new targets for depression treatment. A growing body of preclinical and clinical work implicates maladaptive signaling in the nucleus accumbens in the etiology of depression. Here I aim to identify how dendritic remodeling of nucleus accumbens projection neurons contributes to depression development and symptomology in a preclinical model of depression. Using this model, I have collected preliminary data showing increased dendritic atrophy and upregulation of a dendritic complexity molecule RhoA in specific nucleus accumbens neurons. Further, pharmacological manipulation of RhoA in the nucleus accumbens can promote or prevent depressive outcomes to stress. In this study, we intend to utilize cutting- edge molecular and in vivo imaging techniques to investigate how RhoA mediates dendritic atrophy and depression-like behavior in specific nucleus accumbens neurons. Specific aim 1 utilizes novel genetic tools to express active and inactive RhoA in select cell types. We will characterize how active and inactive RhoA contribute to depression-like behavior and assess their roles in promoting or preventing depressive outcomes to social stress. Specific aim 2 utilizes in vivo imaging to test whether blocking active RhoA in select cell types can prevent decreases in neural activity found in mice displaying depressive behaviors. Together, these experiments will provide new information on the molecular mechanisms of dendritic remodeling in depression, which has the potential to inform about future depression therapeutics.',\n",
       " 'Abstract The inhibitory control and dynamic tuning of cortical circuits is mediated by a diversity of GABAergic cell types, but the biological basis of interneuron identity and diversity is not well understood. Here, we combine developmental genetic, anatomic and transcriptomic approaches to define and discover bona fide cell types within a broad class of cortical interneurons. Parvalbumin containing, fast-spiking basket cells (PVCs) are the largest population of interneurons in the neocortex and integrate in infragranular, granular (layer IV), and supragranular circuits, each with unique input/output connectivity. Recent findings from our laboratory and others suggest heterogeneity in PVC morphology, synaptic properties, and connectivity, but it is uncertain how many of these represent distinct subtypes. Using a developmental genetic strategy, we take advantage of the inside-out laminar specification of PVCs to identify and characterize subtypes based on lineage and birth time restricted cohorts. PVCs are derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), and the transition from progenitor to differentiated neuron is marked by the upregulation of proneural transcription factors. By intersecting inducible Ascl1-CreER and Dlx1-CreER mice with PV-Flp mice and an intersectional reporter and inducing in mid-to-late embryogenesis, we have begun parsing adult laminar PVC subtypes for multifactorial single-cell analysis. We quantify the laminar position and morphology of lineage restricted and birth-dated PVC cohorts. We will also carry out single cell RNAseq to analyze their transcription profiles. The integration of morphological and anatomical characterization with single cell RNAseq will increase our understanding of cell identity in PVCs and can potentially uncover new underlying cellular properties. Because PVCs are implicated in schizophrenia, autism, and other mental disorders, their complete profiling at the single cell level could aid in understanding pathophysiology and suggest better treatment strategies.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY The filoviruses (family Filoviridae), comprising five ebolaviruses, a cuevavirus, and two Marburg viruses, are negative-strand RNA viruses that cause severe hemorrhagic fever with up to 90% human case fatality rate. The 2014?2016 epidemic in Western Africa, caused by the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) species demonstrated the potential for these viruses to cause dire health emergencies of global scope, and highlighted the need for development of therapeutics and vaccines. Sudan virus (SUDV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), and Marburg virus (MARV) have all caused large human outbreaks with high case fatality rates, and thus have similar epidemic potential. In particular, while SUDV, the subject of this proposal caused the 2nd largest filovirus outbreak to date, no therapy or vaccine is currently available. Our product, CM-SV1, is a humanized first-in-class, single dose, monoclonal antibody (mAb) against SUDV for use as both a prophylactic and a therapeutic agent, thus serving the needs of frontline medical staff and infected persons. mAbs represent an attractive therapeutic modality for filoviruses because mAb cocktails or convalescent IgG has been demonstrated to provide post-exposure protection of non-human primates. Furthermore, mAbs are generally well-tolerated and have favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Given the sporadic and unpredictable nature of outbreaks, it would be highly advantageous to have mAb therapies against each of the filoviruses ready for rapid deployment as emergency therapeutics. To date, we have produced CM-SV1 in both HEK293 and N. bethathasmia (tobacco) and have demonstrated efficacy in lethal challenge models in murine and guinea pig models of SUDV infection. The purpose of this proposal is to first determine developability of CM-SV1 and then to develop CM-SV1 to a technology readiness level (TRL) 5 in preparation for investigational new drug (IND) filing. In Phase I, we will engineer the Fc portion CM-SV1 to have improved prophylactic capabilities, produce CM-SV1 in an industry standard for manufacturing (Chinese Hamster ovary cells), determine developability, demonstrate non-inferior efficacy compared to HEK produced CM-SV1 in a murine challenge model, and determine success in engineering enhanced half-life. In Phase II, we will determine non-inferior efficacy compared to HEK produced CM-SV1 in a guinea pig challenge model, determine toxicity, prepare and file a pre-IND application and conduct a Type B meeting with FDA, and finally demonstrate efficacy of CM-SV1 in a non-human primate SUDV lethal challenge model. At the culmination of this program CM-SV1 will be optimized for cGMP manufacture and IND preparation.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT  The goal of this project is to study the role of the host SK1-S1P pathway in controlling the infection by Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn). In previous studies, we identified that the host sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) and its product sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are critical for the formation of the lung granuloma against Cn.1-3 Our studies in mice are supported by the observation that patients treated with FTY720 (Fingolimod) for multiple sclerosis4 (MS) developed cryptococcosis.5-9 When we administered FTY720 to our model of mouse granuloma, Cn lung infection reactivated and fungal cells disseminated from the lung to the brain tissue, eventually killing the animals. Intriguingly, this effect was not observed with BAF312 or AUY954 treatment. FTY720 is a sphingosine analog that, once phosphorylated, mimics S1P and binds to S1P receptors S1Pr1, S1Pr3 and S1Pr510 whereas the un-phosphorylated form of BAF312 or AUY954 binds to S1Pr1 and S1Pr5,11 or only to S1Pr1,12 respectively. These results suggest that SK1-S1P may regulate the containment of Cn cells within the lung granuloma through the inhibition of a specific S1P receptor(s), such as S1Pr3, as this is one of the receptors targeted by FTY720 but not by the other compounds. Because these drugs all induce a severe lymphopenia by blocking the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes,13-15 our studies also suggest that lymphopenia may not be sufficient for Cn infection to reactivate.  Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the action of S1P on S1Pr regulates the host cellular immunity against Cn and that blocking S1Pr3 is detrimental for the host and may lead to reactivation of cryptococcosis during lymphopenia. Thus we will: 1) determine how SK1-S1P regulates the formation of Cn granuloma; and 2) define the host immune response controlled by SK1-S1P that protects against the reactivation of Cn granuloma.',\n",

       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause debilitating twisting movements and postures. Abnormal dopamine (DA) neurotransmission is consistently observed across many different forms of dystonia, but the DA defects that give rise to dystonia are poorly understood. L-DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD) is considered a prototype disorder for understanding how abnormal DA neurotransmission evokes dystonia. DRD is characterized by childhood onset dystonia with diurnal fluctuation whereby symptoms worsen throughout the course of the day. The distinguishing feature of DRD is the dramatic improvement in symptoms after restoration of DA signaling with L-DOPA or DA agonists. Indeed, DRD is caused by mutations in genes critical for DA synthesis, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). DRD-causing TH mutations are associated with some residual TH activity whereas mutations that abolish TH activity cause childhood parkinsonism suggesting that TH activity and [DA] are critical determinants in the development of dystonia. However, the nature of the DA signaling dysfunction that gives rise to dystonia is unknown. To address this gap in our knowledge, we generated a knockin mouse bearing the human DRD-causing Q381K mutation in TH (DRD mice). Like the human disorder, DRD mice display reduced TH activity, a reduction in [DA], dystonic movements that worsen throughout the course of the active period and improvement in the dystonia in response to L-DOPA. Thus, DRD mice exhibit the core neurochemical and symptomatic features of human DRD, thereby providing us with the unprecedented opportunity to dissect the mechanisms underlying DRD from gene to behavior. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the dystonia is mediated by [DA] that is <1% of normal. A similar reduction in presynaptic DA in adults would cause parkinsonism. Therefore, divergent postsynaptic responses likely account for the differences in the neurological consequences of reduced DA transmission between Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia. Indeed, our preliminary data demonstrate D1R supersensitivity, hyperexcitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), a reduction in MSN dendrite number and abnormal corticostriatal innervation. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that early life DA deficiency in combination with (mal)adaptive postsynaptic responses gives rise to dystonia by using a multidisciplinary approach to examine the pre- and postsynaptic consequences of reduced DA transmission associated with dystonia. The Specific Aims are: 1. To elucidate the relationship between monoamine metabolism and the severity of dystonia. 2. To determine the DA receptor subtype(s) and signaling defects that contribute to the dystonia. 3. To delineate alterations in th intrinsic and synaptic properties of D1 and D2R-expressing MSNs. 4. To examine the dendritic morphology and ultrastructural changes in corticostriatal synapses onto D1R and D2R-expressing MSNs in response to early-life DA deprivation in DRD mice.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Cardiovascular (CV) event prevention (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident) remains the single most important public health problem in the United States, and cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among VA users. Improving the provision of prevention services is a primary focus of the Secretary's New Models of Care Transformational Initiative. However, prevention has been challenging to achieve. Multifactorial behavioral interventions are effective in treating a number of chronic illnesses (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), but less is known about their ability to reduce risk among patients without a unifying chronic illness. Group visits are an efficient, effective strategy for delivering a multifactorial behavior change intervention; the VA is committed to the group visit strategy to address a wide array of primary care problems.  Groups have been shown to be an effective means of improving a number of outcomes in a number of individual diseases, but, again, their role in cardiovascular prevention among patients without a single common illness is unknown. Coaching is a type of multi-factorial behavioral intervention that involves goal-setting, and working to overcome barriers to behavior change. Coaching can be performed one-on-one, but coaching interventions have been delivered in group settings. We have shown, in a 150-subject RCT, that group coaching plus individualized telephone coaching reduces cardiovascular risk, but the population in that study was very different from typical VA users.   We propose a three-site, two-arm randomized trial measuring the effectiveness of a group prevention coaching (GPC) intervention in improving cardiovascular risk, compared to VA usual care. The study will be performed at the Durham, Buffalo, and Syracuse VAMCs. Each arm will have 200 patients; patients will be VA users without prior history of cardiovascular event, but with at least 5% risk of such an event, and with either inadequately controlled hypertension or dyslipidemia, or current smoking. The GPC intervention will focus on changing a behavior of the patient's choice that is likely to lead to improvements in cholesterol, blood pressure, or to smoking cessation. Behaviors that will be reinforced will include but not be limited to healthy eating, decreased caloric intake, increased physical activity, stress reduction, and participatory decision making with physicians. Barriers to these behaviors will be identified. The coach in both intervention arms will adopt a problem-solving approach to overcoming the above barriers and reinforcing the above behaviors; problem- solving is a well-described framework for behavior change. The GPC coach/interventionist for will be either the  facility's Health Behavior Coordinator (HBC) or a  person hired for the research enterprise but trained and  credentialed identically to an HBC.   All  outcomes will be obtained at baseline and 6 months after enrollment by blinded research personnel.  The primary outcome will be change in 10-year risk of fatal coronary event or non-fatal MI 6 months after enrollment, as measured by Framingham Risk Score. Key secondary outcomes will include dietary content by Food Frequency Questionnaire (26), physical activity as measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire (27), and weight. We will also determine if group cohesion, as measured by the Group Dynamics Inventory (28), influences the effectiveness of GPC. We well also assess whether time spent in contact with a coach influences the effectiveness, by database log-in timekeeping strategies.\",\n",

MSKCC's research programs are grouped into three categories: Basic Research (Regulation of Cell Behavior, Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Genomic Integrity, and Molecular Structure); Bridge Research (Cancer Biology and Experimental Pathology, Experimental Therapeutics, Immunology and Transplantation, and Imaging and Radiation Sciences); and Patient-Oriented Research (Clinical Research and Survivorship, Outcomes and Risk). The programs are designed to optimize the use of a large patient population and an extensive, multi-disciplinary staff of clinical and laboratory-based Investigators and to encourage the application of discoveries in the basic sciences in a way that advances the prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of many forms of cancer. Scientific work in the 10 research programs depends on services provided by 34 core facilities. We are requesting funding from the Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) for 21 of these core facilities. During the next five years, MSKCC will continue to enlarge its clinical and research facilities and its research and training programs in key research areas. Support is requested to provide developmental funding for the laboratories of new Investigators recruited in research areas aligned with the Center's strategic vision, to support cross-disciplinary pilot projects in population science research, and to support the core facilities.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract This R34 resubmission proposes to develop and examine a mental health service model for families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay that reduces risk for mental health problems, and in turn, enhances readiness for preschool. Infants/toddlers with developmental delay exhibit significantly higher rates of disruptive behaviors, peer problems, impulsivity, and academic failure. Their parents also are at elevated risk for mental health problems and child maltreatment. Families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay are more likely to live in poverty with limited access to services, and most receive government-funded, home- based Early Intervention (EI) services (i.e., Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). We propose to leverage the unique position of Infant-Toddler Developmental Specialists (ITDS), front-line providers of EI services, to support parent-infant/toddler interactions and reduce family risks for mental health problems. Based on a rich empirical literature, we selected Child-Directed Interaction (CDI), the first phase of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, as an evidence-based intervention to increase positive parent-infant/toddler interactions and reduce negative interactions. CDI aligns with the training, role, and function of ITDS, and responds to the needs of referred families. We will collaborate with EI provider agencies toward a service model that emphasizes initial training, ongoing supervision, and quality assurance to facilitate infant/toddler mental health (social, emotional, behavioral competence) and parent mental health (anxiety/depression, parenting stress, caregiver strain). We will examine feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of the proposed model to identify facilitators and barriers to service delivery, and we will examine its promise compared to services as usual (n = 4 agencies, 16 ITDS, 112 families). In light of the extensive needs and depleting resources faced by families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay, the proposed work provides a unique opportunity to enhance the natural role and capacity of a skilled EI workforce to provide high quality services that minimize mental health problems and facilitate healthy child and family trajectories.',\n",
       " \"Project Title: Syphilis in Chicago: Epidemiology, Sexual Networking and Modeling for Prevention ABSTRACT The incidence of syphilis has been increasing in the US for at least 10 years, especially among men who have sex with men (MSM). Syphilis seroprevalence is higher among HIV-infected MSM, an indicator of condomless sexual contact and associated with incident HIV infection. Chicago is one of the major epicenters of the syphilis epidemic and includes the largest contiguous African American population in the United States. We propose to identify and characterize those at greatest risk for incident new and recurrent syphilis infections and better define the patterns of transmission, reinfection and co-infection within the social and sexual networks of a diverse group of MSM (16-39 years of age) who are disproportionately impacted. The study, STI Chicago Epidemiology Network Study (SCENES), will enroll 150 high-risk MSM using a recently developed two-step (2S) network recruitment approach in three of Chicago's highest prevalence neighborhoods and monitor them quarterly for 2 years for incident syphilis and other STIs including HIV. We will collect detailed social and sexual network, and risk behavior data and create a syphilis transmission model that is built upon our existing MSM agent-based HIV transmission model platform to incorporate detailed sexual network dynamics, syphilis treatment and reinfection. We will also work closely with our existing Chicago Department of Public Health programs and outreach clinics in order to coordinate treatment of STIs, determine previous treatment and infection histories, engage clients in care and provision of condoms and PrEP as is our current practice. This proposal will contribute valuable new knowledge about syphilis incidence in the highest prevalence neighborhoods in Chicago, and provide a clear understanding of syphilis mono- and co-infection networks. Sexual network analysis using dynamic exponential random graph models that are embedded within our existing agent-based model platform will provide an opportunity to include future genetic network data and serve as a framework for testing emerging prevention interventions prior to conducting clinical trials or implementing prevention strategies.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Heart attack and stroke, which together are called cardiovascular disease, cause over 1/3 of all deaths in VA patients. The current guidelines for the prevention of these conditions focus on lowering patients' blood pressure and cholesterol levels. A new treatment strategy, which I call benefit-based tailored treatment, that instead guides treatment decisions based on the likelihood that a medication would prevent a heart attack or stroke could prevent more cardiovascular disease, with lower medication use, and be more patient centered. The purpose of this Career Development Award is to develop and assess tools and approaches that could enable the implementation of benefit-based tailored treatment of cardiovascular disease, in particular a decision support tool and educational program for clinicians and a performance profiling system. The decision support tool will enable better care by showing clinicians patient-specific estimates of the likelihood that their medication decisions will prevent a cardiovascular disease event. The performance profiling system will encourage better care by assessing the quality of care provided at VA sites and in PACT teams based on how well the medical care provided follows this treatment strategy. The project will have three aims. Aim 1: In the first aim, I will seek to understand clinicians' and patients' perceptions of and receptivity to the use of benefit-based tailored treatment for cardiovascular disease. Information gained from qualitative research with clinicians will help assess and improve the usability and effectiveness of the decision support tool and educational program for clinicians, along with the acceptability of the treatment strategies in general. Information gained from focus groups with patients will help learn their priorities in cardiovascular disease prevention, to help identify ways to make the interventions and their assessments more patient-centered. Aim 2: In the second aim, the decision support tool and educational program will be assessed in a real-world randomized pilot study involving thirty clinicians. Half of the clinicians will be provided the decision support tool and education intervention for ten patients each, the other half will receive a traditional quality improvement program and treatment reminders. The study will have formative goals of ensuring that clinicians and patients believe the tool is valuable and does not disrupt care processes or workflow for anyone in the PACT team. This will be studied with qualitative and survey assessments. The primary summative outcome will be the influence of the intervention on clinicians' treatment decisions. Secondary outcomes will assess patients' satisfaction with their visits and their clinicians. Aim 3: The third aim will develop and evaluate a novel performance measurement system based on benefit- based tailored treatment. First, the performance profiling system will be developed. Then the profiling system's ability to reliably differentiate high quality from low-quality care will be evaluated.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION         This study will explicitly compare the effects of a 12-week progressive exercise training program on 1) the clinical symptoms of chronic pain and PTSD, 2) pain threshold and tolerance, and 3) anti-stress, anti- nociceptive neurohormones such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and allopregnanolone/pregnanolone (ALLO) in veterans with chronic pain/PTSD compared to healthy comparison participants. The revised study design includes a baseline cardiopulmonary exercise assessment (CPX) that will inform the exercise prescription for a 12-week progressive exercise training program, comprised of three 30-45 minute exercise sessions per week (walking or running, depending on the ability/capacity of the participant). Exercise sessions will be initially supervised by an exercise physiologist in the Clinical Studies Unit (CSU) at the VA Boston Healthcare System and then each participant will transition into the home. Weekly telephone calls by the PI will provide additional motivational support and assistance with problem solving. Implementation of the prescribed exercise regimen will also be supported by the use of heart rate and actigraph monitors programmed for the participant to achieve their prescribed heart rate range (HRR). Finally, an endpoint maximum load exercise assessment will occur at week 13 in order to track measurable change for both psychological and neurobiological factors and to delineate their impact on pain indices and PTSD symptomatology. Both maximum load exercise tests will be performed in accordance with guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology. Measures of pain, pain tolerance (via the cold pressor test) will be implemented 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after exercise testing as well as at a midpoint check-in at which self-report questionnaires will also be repeated. Based on the PI's earlier research, the role of exercise motivation and self-efficacy on changes in perceived pain and pain tolerance will be correlated with changes in NPY and ALLO levels, pre and post exercise. It is anticipated that differences in biological responses to aerobic and anaerobic exercise between healthy participants and those with chronic pain/PTSD will predict differences in the psychological and pain-reducing benefits of aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Once identified, such factors could be augmented by modification of the exercise regimen in order to help enhance the ant-stress hormone levels for the pain/PTSD population and experience clinically significant reductions in their symptoms. In order to obtain sufficient power as well as accounting for an expected drop-out rate of 18-20%, the proposed recruitment is 30 participants per condition (total of 60 participants). Data from this pilot work will be used to compute effect sizes in support of a future clinical trial incorporating individually prescribed exercise regimens and a motivationally based exercise behavior change intervention aimed at reducing pain and PTSD symptoms in our Veterans. Advanced education and training is sought by this CDA-2 award applicant in four broad areas: 1) psychophysiology of chronic pain and PTSD with a sub-focus on sex differences, 2) the neurobiology of chronic stress, PTSD, and pain, 3) exercise physiology and 4) the neuropsychology and neurobiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The combination of didactic and experiential training in these areas will serve the PI's long-term goal of becoming an independent scientist/practitioner in the VA focused on development of improved treatments for health conditions co-morbid with PTSD such as chronic pain and mild TBI. In the shorter-term, this CDA-2 will allow the PI to develop a more effective, motivationally based, exercise behavior change protocol that fosters long- term exercise compliance in patients with chronic pain/PTSD. This intervention will be used as an adjunct to cognitive interventions for these disorders to be further developed and studied via a larger VA, NIH, or DOD- funded grant for which the PI will apply in years 4-5 of the CDA2.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The population of senior Veterans prone to heart failure (HF) is expanding rapidly. Exercise intolerance and dyspnea are common symptoms that detract from independence and quality of life and also predispose to increased mortality and morbidity. Peripheral pathophysiology, particularly involving skeletal muscle (SkMx) and vascular perfusion, likely exacerbates limitations such that HF symptoms and poor outcomes relate to combined effects of central and peripheral mechanisms. While HF therapeutic guidelines emphasize cardiac therapeutic parameters, goals to modify HF SkMx function may provide vital complementary gains.  This proposal focuses on benefits of exercise training for HF and evolves from a pilot analysis we began three years ago. Preliminary data show reduced functional capacity (both aerobic and strength) in older HF patients (mean age 66?10 yrs) compared to age-matched healthy controls. SkMx expression of certain genes controlling ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in muscle correspond to the decreased aerobic and strength indices; lean muscle mass also correlates inversely to reduced strength. We now propose to compare four different exercise regimens (i.e., aerobic, strength, combined aerobic-strength, and inspiratory training) to explore how each modality changes function/symptoms in relation to specific peripheral training effects, i.e., exercise effects on SkMx biology (histology, gene expression), peripheral perfusion, and body composition.  Male and female (N=200) systolic HF patients (LVEF d40%) aged e50 years will be studied. Patients will be randomized into one of four 12-week, three weekly training regimens. A comprehensive battery of functional assessments (aerobic, strength, and integrated performance), symptoms, and physiological indices (SkMx histology, gene expression, and perfusion, body composition, and serological measures of inflammation, cytokines, and adipokines) will be assessed before and after training.  Specific aims are: (1) To assess differences in functional outcomes relative to the different training regimens (aerobic vs. strength vs. aerobic-strength vs. inspiratory). We hypothesize that aerobic-strength will be superior to aerobic or strength alone. We also hypothesize that inspiratory training will match the affects of traditional aerobic-strength as it imparts aerobic and strengthening physiology to the diaphragm. (2) To assess gene expression and SkMx perfusion in relation to the different training regimens. We hypothesize that proteolytic genes (FoxO, Ubiquitin) will be over-expressed in relation to diminished function and that the genes counteracting SkMx proteolysis (IGF-1, PGC-1?) will increase in relation to functional gains. Consistently, we will compare how different training regimens modulate gene expression patterns. We hypothesize that exercise modes that directly stimulate SkMx function (strength and inspiratory) will best decrease proteolytic and in- crease anabolic gene expression patterns, and exercise modes that stimulate central cardiac performance and vascular relaxation (aerobic and inspiratory training) will induce relatively greater changes in SkMx perfusion.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION:      Current U.S. Veteran demographics reveal an aging population with significant cardiovascular dysfunction. This ultimately manifests as mobility limitation, inactivity, and a subsequent worsening of cardiovascular disease (CVD) that often leads to death. However, despite this clear negative cycle of events, there is not a single clinically accepted, and therefore routinely utilized, method of assessing vascular health. As nitric oxide (NO) is anti- atherogenic and cardioprotective, identifying an in vivo bioassay of NO bioavailability has significant worth in ths arena. Passive leg movement (PLM) and the subsequent blood flow increase, measured non-invasively by ultrasound Doppler in the common femoral artery, is emerging as a method by which vascular endothelial function and therefore NO bioavailability can be determined, however, this method is still in its infancy. Here, we propose the validation and characterization of PLM, as a novel, clinically relevant, method to determine vascular health and guide rehabilitation. With the growing interest in personalized medicine, the development of tools, such as PLM, that allow individualized assessments to guide the physician, the patient, and the rehabilitative team, are essential. Therefore two specific aims are proposed that will address the Central Hypothesis that PLM is an NO-dependent, reproducible, and clinically relevant tool to assess vascular health across the human lifespan. The ultimate goal of the proposed studies will be to assist in catalyzing the transition of the assessment of endothelial function by PLM from research to clinical practice.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) and tremor.  Additionally, humanitarian device exemptions for dystonia and obsessive-compulsive disorder have been established and studies are underway for depression and epilepsy.  Although a highly successful therapy, there remain many challenges to the field.  One of such challenges is the large number of surgical targets, stimulation settings, and electrode configurations that have to be attempted in the search for therapeutic clinical outcomes.  A wide range of factors such as neurologic state, electrode placement, brain shift, tissue encapsulation, and stimulation parameters can affect the clinical outcomes of DBS.  As such, there is a critical need for DBS systems that can compensate for some of these uncontrollable factors.  For example, by using the brain's dynamic environment to guide electrode placement and stimulation programming, thereby resulting in a DBS system that can be tailored to individual patients and symptoms.  Characterization of electroactive neurochemicals in charge of modulating critical therapeutic neural activity will allow us to use real-time neurotransmitter concentration measurements to identify these optimal locations for electrode placement, as well as to identify optimal stimulation parameters after the electrode has been implanted.  We propose to study the neurochemical dynamics of DBS by characterizing striatal dopamine responses evoked by STN stimulation.  We also propose using these responses to develop a closed-loop system for modulating dopamine concentration.  In Aim 1, we will develop an inexpensive animal model for acute characterization of striatal dopamine release evoked by DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in anesthetized healthy pigs.  In Aim 2, we will use techniques developed using the less-expensive pig model to develop a closed-loop controller for modulating dopamine concentration in healthy anesthetized non-human primates (NHP).  Finally, in Aim 3, we will use a NHP model of PD to develop a neurochemically-mediated closed-loop DBS system for sustained therapeutic response in a dynamic environment.  Characterization of the neurochemical dynamics of dopamine evoked by DBS represents an important step forward toward understanding the underlying mechanisms of DBS.  In the future, closed-loop systems building on the system proposed here will reduce the need for frequent clinical interventions in the form of DBS programming and medication adjustments.  Undoubtedly, this technology will have a profound impact on both basic and clinical neuroscience approaches to the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disease, and will provide the rationale for expanding the neurologic and psychiatric conditions that can be treated with DBS.\",\n",
       " \"Project Summary/Abstract Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a very common, inherited disease affecting the world's population with a frequency of approximately 1:500. No approved treatment to slow or halt disease progression is currently available in the US. The disease progresses slowly to renal failure, typically in the 4-6th decades of life. However, for unknown reasons the rate of progression greatly varies from patient to patient even within the same family suggesting that environmental factors may affect disease progression. Recent results from animal studies suggest that renal insults are required - in addition to the gene mutation - for renal cysts to arise. However, rare forms of renal injury are unlikely to account for the constant pace of disease progression in humans.  Our results suggest that a much more prevalent form of sub-clinical renal insult is the trigger of renal cyst formation that determines the rate of progression in ADPKD: microcrystals that are sporadically lodged in renal tubule lumens. We show that deposition of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals in renal tubules leads to rapid activation of the mTOR and Src/STAT3 signaling pathways, both of which are also strongly activated in ADPKD. In addition, CaOx crystal deposition leads to rapid tubule diameter widening that can be blocked by mTOR inhibition. Our results suggest that tubule dilation is a purposeful, and previously unrecognized, protective mechanism that facilitates crystal excretion. After crystal clearance, tubule diameters return to normal within a week. However, in mice lacking PC1 - the protein affected in ADPKD - CaOx challenge leads to persistent tubule dilation that ?overshoots? to cystic progression. This suggests that PC1 is required to re- establish normal tubule diameters after insults. We hypothesize (1) that tubule dilation is an innate renal protective mechanism against tubular crystals; and (2) that this mechanism inadvertently acts as a trigger for tubule dilation leading to cyst formation in ADPKD. If correct - these ?ndings immediately open a new and highly feasible avenue for therapeutic intervention because well-established treatments for recurring nephrolithiasis (dietary changes, increased water intake, citrate) should also be effective in slowing the progression of ADPKD.  Using mouse and rat models of CaOx nephrolithiasis we will investigate tubule dilation and signaling pathway activation in response to crystal deposition and test whether citrate treatment prevents these effects (Aim 1). Using pharmacological inhibitors and genetic mouse models we will determine if tubule dilation is required for effective crystal clearance (Aim 2). Using conditional knockout mice for the ablation of cilia or PC1, respectively, we will determine if tubular crystal deposition acts as a trigger for cystogenesis (Aim 3). Using a mosaic PC1-KO mouse model and a rat model of PKD we will determine if crystal burden modulates disease severity in PKD.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 1 Prognosis is the risk of an outcome for a condition or disease, such as mortality of mobility impairment. A  2 prognostic index assembles the risk from multiple risk factors to predict outcome more accurately than a single  3 factor would predict on its own. Current prognostic indexes suffer either from being inaccurate, un-  4 interpretable, or both. Consequently, clinicians are unable to accurately determine prognosis in clinical  5 decision making for older adults, often leading to poor outcomes for patients. Many older adults are referred to  6 hospice in the last few hours or days before death, or never at all Other patients are exposed to the harms of  7 cancer screening without the possibility they will live long enough to benefit. Currently available prognostic  8 models estimate risk over a given time frame, such as risk of death over a 4 year period. Clinicians and  9 patients do not think of risk this way, however. They want to know how long do I have? This project will 10 address this question by making novel use of the exceptionally long follow up time in the nationally 11 representative National Institute of Aging-funded Health and Retirement Study. The objectives of this project 12 are to use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to develop and validate easy-to-use prognostic tools that 13 estimate life-expectancy and time to the onset of disability, inability to manage medications or finances, or 14 mobility impairment. Prognostic tools will be internally validated using the HRS and externally validated 15 using the English Longitudinal Study on Aging (ELSA). This approach leverages the fact that the ELSA was 16 based on the HRS. This project is expected to have a positive impact by informing, individualizing, and 17 improving clinical decision-making in older adults.',\n",
       " 'Breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among women in West Virginia/Central Appalachia. About one out of every three cancer deaths are linked to excess body weight and Appalachia and West Virginia have some of the highest rates of obesity in the country. Obese women (especially in postmenopausal women) have higher rates of breast cancer incidence, are less responsive to cancer therapy and have worse clinical outcomes than non-obese women. Leucine is an essential amino acid that is elevated in obesity and is required for the activation of Mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR), which is kinase that is critical for tumor growth. Breast cancer cells absorb extracellular leucine through L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 (LAT1). The expression of LAT1 is higher in breast cancer compared with normal breast tissue, and its expression is more highly expressed in more advanced cancers, indicating that it is associated with breast cancer progression. Identifying the regulation and function of LAT1- leucine signaling in breast cancer in obesity should foster new ways to suppress this disease in obesity. Our preliminary studies have uncovered that the adipocyte secretome upregulates the expression of LAT1 and mTOR1 activity in human breast cancer cells. Increases in the transcription and activity of LAT1 are driven by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the estrogen receptor (ER). Preventing leucine uptake has a marked inhibitory effect on breast cancer cell colony formation, which supports our hypothesis that leucine transporters are critical for breast cancer cell survival and proliferation. These findings provide the basis for our proposal that will establish the regulation and function of LAT1-leucine in breast cancer in obesity and its requirement for mTOR1 activity and tumor progression. In Aim 1, we will decipher the signaling pathways that activate leucine-mTOR signaling in breast cancer in response to obesity-associated hormone levels. Aim 2 will focus on elucidating the intracellular mechanisms by which obesity in vivo promotes breast cancer development and progression over long periods of time. These studies should lead to the development of new therapies that inhibit leucine-stimulated induction on mTOR1 to suppress breast cancer in obesity. In addition to increasing our understanding of obesity and breast cancer, participation in this COBRE project will allow me to receive intensive career and scientific mentoring while generating important novel data to attain my goal of becoming a successful independent investigator with NIH R01 funding.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary This project follows up on our recent research implicating the neurotransmitter dopamine signaling as key mediator of circadian timing systems. Our main hypothesis is a subpopulation of dopaminergic neurons send signals to a population of dopamine type 1 receptor 1 (D1r)-expressing neurons in the dorsal striatum, constituting a critical link between food intake and circadian rhythms of daily activity. To address this hypothesis we propose to generate several genetically modified mice and test their behavioral and physiological entrainment to scheduled feeding. These results will expand our understanding of how the downstream targets of dopamine neurons control several important aspects of feeding related behaviors. In addition, since there are numerous dopaminergic drugs available, this research may suggest potential therapeutic strategies to target diseases associated with over- and under-eating.  ',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Giardiasis, the disease caused by the eukaryotic parasite Giardia lamblia, is the most common intestinal parasitic disease in the U.S. and a major cause of morbidity in children throughout the world; estimates indicate 280 million cases of Giardia annually. Newly emerging drug-resistant strains are proving difficult to treat, and the front-line treatment, metronidazole, has a high incidence of side effects. Therefore, there is a critical need for anti-Giardia drugs that target novel molecular pathways. Giardia belongs to one of the earliest diverging groups of eukaryotes and is therefore quite divergent from metazoans. Opportunities for developing targeted therapeutics exist within this divergent biology. This proposal explores the biology of Rho family GTPases in Giardia. These proteins act as molecular switches that control essential cellular processes. Giardia contains a single Rho family GTPase homolog, gRac, previously demonstrated to play a conserved role in regulating polarity, membrane trafficking, and the cytoskeleton, all of which are essential to viability and pathogenesis. Functional assays have demonstrated that gRac plays a role in cyst formation. This process requires pulsed production, processing, and secretion of cyst wall protein (CWP) to make environmentally resistant cysts and is the only known regulated secretory pathway in Giardia. Rho GTPases are known to regulate ER-Golgi transport and secretory events in plants and animals. How CWP secretion is triggered in Giardia remains enigmatic, yet gRac is a likely candidate for regulating this process. Aim 1 of this proposal identifies the specific role of gRac n infectious cyst formation by following cyst wall markers through the secretory process. Also unknown is how gRac signaling is linked to downstream processes, previously unidentified downstream effectors (Giardia-specific or potentially ancient and undiscovered) are hypothesized to link gRac signaling to the cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. Using affinity purification and mass spectroscopy, 199 putative gRac interactors were identified. Aim 2 proposes to validate four of these gRac interactors as downstream effectors of membrane trafficking and/or the cytoskeleton through microscopy and knockdown studies. Upstream of gRac is a set of six gRac modulators that act to activate or inhibit gRac signaling. Aim 3, proposes to determine their contribution to gRac signaling and identify specific biological roles for each modulator using a combination of depletion studies and assays to measure cell proliferation, parasite attachment, and the ability to form infectious cysts. The proposed experiments are expected to define the central role of gRac in Giardia biology and pave the way toward discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Furthermore, because the Giardia genome contains only a single Rho GTPase and a handful of upstream modulators, the system is highly tractable and may uncover fundamental biology that has been obscured by the more complex signaling systems found in model eukaryotes.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Obesity is a disease that affects 33% of the US population, leads to the development of severe comorbidities such as diabetes, and results in overall poor quality of life. The development of obesity is influenced by many genetic, environmental, and cultural factors but ultimately is strongly dependent on caloric intake and diet. Gastrointestinal (GI) peptides and hormones are known to influence appetite, satiation, and energy expenditure through interactions with cognate receptors expressed in the brain or in peripheral nerve fibers making them an appealing therapeutic target for obesity treatment. Our laboratory has previously described a putative role for a particular GI peptide, peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), where application of PYY to the oral cavity in mice promotes decreased food intake and weight loss without causing conditioned taste aversion (Acosta et al 2012, Hurtado et al 2013). Notably, cognate neuropeptide Y receptors (YRs) for PYY have been detected in taste buds as well as receptors for leptin and GLP-1, two other pro satiety hormones (La Sala et al 2013, Shigamura et al 2004, Martin et al 2009). The discovery of satiety hormone receptors in taste buds is intriguing, specifically because of the influence of taste on both feeding behavior and caloric consumption. Based on preliminary RNA sequencing of the murine taste bud transcriptome conducted in our laboratory, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of murine circumvallate taste buds and discovered that key receptors for adiponectin (APN), Adipor1 and Cdh13, are expressed in PLC?+ taste receptor cells. This finding is significant because APN is a protein known to be down-regulated in obese humans and known to effect body weight and glucose homeostasis in mice (Arita et al 1999, Kubota et al 2002). In addition, APN is present in saliva as well as in the circulation although a specific role for salivary APN has yet to be identified. Using a behavioral brief-access taste response test in adiponectin null (APN-/-) mice, we have further discovered that these mice display an increased sensitivity to intralipid stimulus. Based on these results, we will first set to fully characterize the expression profile of Adipor1 and Cdh13 in murine circumvallate taste buds by performing dual IHC staining using antibodies for Adipor1 and Cdh13 as well as antibodies for established taste receptor cell markers. Next, we will assess the functional effects of salivary APN on intralipid taste sensing in a mouse model that expresses APN solely in saliva, using a brief-access taste response test. Finally we will use this same salivary adiponectin mouse model to study the effects of salivary APN on food intake and body weight gain when exposed to a high fat diet. The outcome of this project will provide insight into the role of salivary APN on taste perception and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of salivary APN modulation, as an effector of food intake and weight loss. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that salivary adiponectin modulates intralipid taste perception in mice. Aim 1: Characterize Adipor1, Adipor2, and Cdh13 receptor gene expression profiles in Type I, Type II, and  Type III TRCs Aim 2: Determine the effect of salivary APN on intralipid taste response in APN-/- mice Aim 3: Determine the effect of salivary adiponectin on food intake and body weight in APN-/- mice',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Clinical management of obstructive lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) relies heavily of drugs that are either agonist or antagonists of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This is because GPCRs control important airway cell functions (contraction, growth, cytokine/chemokine production, chemotaxis, and permeability) that become dysregulated in disease. Unfortunately, these drugs have limitations with respect to both efficacy and safety, and many patients experience suboptimal control. We propose to identify new, more effective ligands that target the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3 mAChR) as a potential COPD therapy, by embracing the emerging concept of biased agonism pharmacology. Biased agonism pharmacology is based on the discovery that GPCRs can assume multiple conformations that transduce qualitatively different signals, and ligands can ?tune? GPCRs to bias signaling to one pathway or another. We propose to discern qualitative signaling properties of the M3 mAChR and determine how canonical (G protein-dependent) versus non-canonical (arrestin-dependent) signaling regulates airway smooth muscle (ASM) functions that are often dysregulated in COPD. We have discovered both small molecule orthosteric ligands as well as a peptide that can bias M3 mAChR signaling toward the arrestin signaling pathway. Preliminary data also strongly suggest arrestin-dependent signaling mediates therapeutically beneficial ASM functions. Lead agents in hand as well as those that emerge in focused screens will be tested in cell- and tissue-based studies of ASM signaling and function, and ultimately in an in vivo model of COPD to discern the utility of these drugs as COPD therapeutics. Three Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will employ genetic and molecular strategies, including use of mice with arrestin subtype genes ablated, to establish the regulatory effects of arrestins on M3 mAChR-mediated functions (contraction, growth, and synthetic functions) in airway smooth muscle. Aim 2 will employ semi-high throughput screening systems, ASM signaling and functional assays, and novel engineered M3 receptors to fully characterize those biased agents in hand and to discover additional biased ligands and peptides. Aim 3 will test our lead biased M3 ligands in an in vivo model of COPD to verify the ability of a biased pharmacology approach to manage the disease. The impact of the proposed studies lies in their ability to significantly advance the science underlying, and ultimate clinical application of, biased agonism pharmacology.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary / Abstract  Neuropathic pain (NeuP) affects >16 million Americans and results in considerable impairment in quality of life. Available medications fail to adequately relief pain in the majority of NeuP patients; moreover, efficacious drugs such as opioids have major safety concerns. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Serotonergic 5-HT3 receptors (5-HT3R) have been identified as a promising pharmacological target in NeuP. After peripheral nerve damage, overexpression of 5-HT3 receptors in spinal cord neurons can shift the character of descending serotonergic modulation from inhibitory to facilitatory, thus contributing to ongoing pain. Intrathecal 5-HT3R antagonists alleviate evoked hypersensitivity in animal NeuP models, but the analgesic effects are inconsistent with systemic administration of these drugs in patients with neuropathic pain. Our preliminary data suggest that efflux transporters such as the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) limit the central nervous system (CNS) exposure of 5-HT3R antagonists, thus preventing analgesia following systemic administration.  We hypothesize that if 5-HT3R antagonists were to reach adequate CNS concentrations, they would be efficacious in relieving neuropathic pain. To validate 5-HT3R as a clinically-relevant drug target in neuropathic pain, we plan to undertake the following translational approach: 1) We will characterize the CNS disposition of model 5-HT3R antagonsits ondansetron and granisteron in a rat model, and determine the effect of efflux transporters such as Pgp on their CNS disposition. This will be done by a) determining drug bio-disposition in rat plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as in brain and spinal cord (whole tissue analysis and micro-dialysis), and b) utilizing genetic and pharmacological knockouts of Pgp transporters to determine the effects of efflux transporters on drug disposition. 2) We will determine the role of Pgp efflux on ondansetron disposition in human CNS. This will be done by detemining the time-course of plasma and CSF concentrations of IV ondansetron in healthy subjects, with and without tariquidar? a selective inhibitor of Pgp transporters. Analgesia will be assessed in an experimental pain model, and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling will be implemented to predict ondansetron concentrations in human brain and spinal cord, based on combined results from animal and human studies. 3) We will determine the effect of adequately CNS-penetrating ondansetron on neuropathic pain. In an experimental cross-over study in NeuP patients, analgesia will be compared when ondansetron is administered with and without tariquidar. In an exploratory mechanism-based analysis, we will determine the association between the extent of individual descending pain facilitation and the analgesic response to 5-HT3R blockade.  We expect the results to successfully determine the mechanisms limiting CNS exposure of 5-HT3R antagonists, and to demonstrate that by bypassing these mechanisms, 5-HT3R antagonists can alleviate neuropathic pain, particularly in patients with sensory phenotype suggesting descending facilitation.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Theoretical models of alcohol use disorder (AUD) argue that dysfunction in frontal lobe-mediated neural circuitry contributes to executive function deficits that are hallmark neurocognitive features of the disorder. Empirical support for these models is extensive, with prior studies reporting pronounced deficits in cortical thickness and white matter integrity in the frontal lobes and associated regions. However, considerably less is known about the impact of AUD on myelinated neurons localized in deeper cortical layers (i.e., intracortical myelin; ICM). These ICM fibers play a crucial role in speeding and synchronizing of neural signals throughout cortex, thereby helping to support optimal cognitive functioning. We hypothesize that ICM deficits directly contribute to executive function impairment in AUD. Importantly, standard techniques for quantifying cortical thickness via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lack neurobiological specificity with respect to the disruption of un-myelinated vs. myelinated cortical tissue in AUD. However, recent methodological advances in structural MRI have enabled in vivo estimation of ICM thickness. The proposed study will utilize a recently-developed T1- weighted pulse sequence that yields high intracortical contrast to examine deficits in ICM as a novel neural marker of AUD. The study has three aims: 1) to compare ICM thickness between individuals with AUD and matched controls; 2) to examine associations between ICM and clinical indicators of alcohol misuse (drinking quantity/frequency and AUD severity) and three domains of executive functioning (response inhibition, delay discounting, working memory) and processing speed; and 3) to explore sex differences in ICM. As the first investigation of ICM in AUD, this study will provide proof-of-concept of whether deficits in ICM are present in comparison with control individuals as well as contextualize variation in ICM within relevant clinical and neurocognitive indices of AUD. If successful, the study will also provide preliminary data for a future longitudinal R01 study investigating the predictive utility of ICM and its recovery over the course of AUD treatment. In sum, we believe that the ICM imaging approach is a distinct methodological innovation that has considerable potential to increase our ability to disentangle subtle differences in cortical morphology that may serve as novel neural markers of AUD in future clinical and research applications.',\n",
       " 'Mother-infant interaction sets the behavioral foundation and trajectory for infant social/cognitive development. Parental social behaviors are especially vulnerable to endocrine-disrupting chemicals because these behaviors are shaped by hormonal priming and by the organization of the social/parental brain. It is known that in utero bisphenol A (BPA) exposure disturbs neurobehavioral development in animals and in humans. The pathways linking in utero BPA exposure to neurobehavioral development likely involve direct effects in utero, and indirect effects via disruption of postnatal mother-infant interactions. To date, little human study has linked prenatal BPA exposure to altered mother-infant interaction or examined the consequence of this effect on neurobehavioral development. Most of the human literature identifies effects of BPA in older children. In rodent and primate models, prenatal exposure to BPA disrupts maternal care and offspring social behavior via epigenetic changes. In humans, these indirect effects on mother-infant interaction and the associated epigenetic mechanisms have not been examined. We thus risk underestimating the full impact of BPA exposure, and we currently do not know the pathways through which BPA may disrupt development. Although BPA has been removed from many consumer products, it has been replaced by structural analogs, bisphenol-s (BPS) and bisphenol-f (BPF), which may have similar detrimental effects. This study aims to translate findings from animal models to ask whether increased prenatal BPA, BPS, BPF (BP) exposure in humans predicts less optimal maternal care/mother-infant interaction and infant/toddler development. Moreover we ask whether this exposure is associated with corresponding epigenetic changes in mother and infant in genes previously shown to be impacted by prenatal BPA exposure in rodents: estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1: implicated in maternal behavior) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; implicated in infant neural plasticity and cognition). In our translational approach, we recruit women during pregnancy, assess prenatal BP exposure using multiple urine samples collected during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. We assess mother-infant interaction with measures of moment-by-moment reciprocal influences between mother and infant, providing a more nuanced measure of the effects of BP in humans, and we assess infant/toddler social and cognitive development at 12 and 24 months. In serially collected buccal swabs, we assess DNA methylation of ESR1 in the mother and infant and of BDNF in the infant to understand how early life BP exposure alters these pathways. Understanding the effects of BP on maternal care and mother-infant interaction is essential to revealing the pathways through which BP acts to disrupt neurodevelopment. This R01 addresses a critical gap in our understanding of how prenatal endocrine-disrupting chemicals alter mother-infant interaction, infant/toddler development, and associated epigenetic processes, with implications for strategies to prevent and mitigate the impact of BP on neurodevelopment.',\n",
       " 'Abstract There is growing evidence that moderate exposure to alcohol during development can lead to behavioral and cognitive deficits that can persist throughout the lifespan. Cognitive impairments associated with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) include abnormalities in learning and memory, executive control and social behaviors and are often characterized by a hyper-focus on one particular task or aspect of a task, to the detriment of other important behaviors. We have recently shown that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can impair executive control in adulthood and that behavioral impairments are accompanied by significant alterations in coherence in the orbitofrontal cortex during choice. Both behavioral deficits and cortical alterations are found when GluN2B subunit containing N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptors (NMDAR) are lost in the OFC. Given preliminary data that GluN2B is significantly reduced in the OFC after PAE, we propose to investigate whether impairments in behavioral flexibility are driven by alterations in cortical coherence mediated by alterations in NMDAR expression and function and whether these deficits can be rescued. We propose to integrate a well-established voluntary drinking paradigms for moderate PAE with touch-screen behavioral assays, in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology and optogenetic stimulation. First, we will express channel rhodopsin (ChR2) in the cortex of PAE and SAC mice and examine whether direct stimulation will rescue behavioral flexibility impairments in PAE mice. Next, given evidence that GluN2B is downregulated after PAE and that his subunit contributes to establishing cortical coherence, we will investigate whether behavioral deficits in the model are mediated by alterations in GluN2B subunit expression and recruitment required to induce plasticity and support behavioral flexibility. Finally, we will examine whether changes in connectivity between OFC and dS drives asynchrony and perseveration. We will use retrograde expression to fluorescently tag OFC-dS neurons and characterize function of NMDAR via ex vivo slice physiology. Then we will utilize retrograde expression of ChR2 to test if stimulation restricted to OFC-dS neurons is sufficient to rescue the behavioral deficits. Taken together the completion of these aims will elucidate the mechanisms of cognitive impairment in FASD and provide an important tool for developing more effective therapies for executive dysfunction.',\n",
       " \"Schizophrenia is a serious and debilitating psychiatric disorder that affects nearly 1% of the world's population. Within the Veterans Health Administration, total costs in FY 2014 for Veterans with psychotic disorders (of which schizophrenia is the most severe) was over 6 billion dollars. Deficits in cognition ? both non-social and social -- are core features of schizophrenia. The deficits in social cognition refer to the processes that are involved in the perception, encoding, storage, retrieval and regulation of information about other people and ourselves. The problems in social cognition underlie the social disability and reduced functioning of the illness. A greater understanding of social cognitive impairments would provide opportunities for targeted recovery- focused interventions. This proposal will address an unanswered question: specifically how and where in the brain social processing goes awry in schizophrenia. We know which social processing brain systems are relevant to understanding schizophrenia. However, we do not know whether social processing impairments emerge within a particular brain system or between systems when they work together (i.e., are integrated). Only some systems are impaired in schizophrenia. For example, mentalizing, which involves taking others' viewpoints, is clearly impaired in schizophrenia. Affect sharing, which is the automatic activation of emotion in ourselves when we see emotional displays in others, is relatively intact. Empathy (i.e. sharing, understanding, and responding to emotional experiences of another person) is a high-level social processing ability that requires integration among processing systems, including affect sharing and mentalizing. Our knowledge of the neural basis of social processing impairments and social disability in schizophrenia is severely lacking, and the goal of this proposal is to address this knowledge gap. The study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine regional brain activity, seed- based connectivity, and brain network organization in 72 Veterans with schizophrenia and 72 group-matched controls. Clinical assessments and performance-based tasks in social cognition will also be included. The aims will be addressed using three social processing paradigms: 1) A Pain Rating Task in which participants view painful and non-painful images. It activates the affect sharing system. 2) A Director's Task in which participants take the same or different viewing perspective as another person. It activates the mentalizing system. And 3) An Empathic Accuracy Task in which participants monitor the mood of a social ?target? on a video. It relies on multiple social processing systems, including affect sharing and mentalizing. A close evaluation of activation, connectivity, and brain network organization in social processing brain systems will identify specific points of neural vulnerability in schizophrenia. In that way, we can begin to understand how specific disruptions in neural processes lead to impaired social functioning.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop an improved, minimally-invasive treatment for intracranial aneurysms. Intracranial aneurysms are spherical outpouchings of blood vessels in the head that result from weakness in the vessel wall. Unruptured aneurysms are present in approximately 3% of the general population, and rupture can be devastating with a high morbidity and mortality. In recent years a new type of minimally- invasive endovascular device to treat aneurysms has been introduced to the market. These devices, known as flow diverting stents, are composed of a tubular metal mesh and are placed in the parent artery to cover the neck of the aneurysm being treated. The small pores in the mesh prevent blood from entering the aneurysm, which causes blood trapped inside the aneurysm to become stagnant and clot. The aneurysm then undergoes a process of healing with the stent acting as a scaffold for reconstruction of the parent artery. Despite their success, first-generation flow diverters suffer from a number of limitations such as delayed aneurysm occlusion, often on the order of months, and the need for multiple devices per patient to achieve complete occlusion. In as many as 25% of patients complete occlusion is never achieved. NeuroSigma's next generation flow diverter is based on Thin Film Nitinol (TFN) technology. TFN is an advanced biomaterial fabricated on silicon wafers that overcomes many of the limitations associated with first-generation flow diverters. Results from animal studies suggest that the TFN flow diverter gives superior rates of aneurysm occlusion and faster parent artery repair than first-generation devices. The purpose of this project is to build upon these intriguing findings an develop a rapid occlusion flow diverter, where placement of a single device results in speedy, definitive aneurysm repair. At the completion of this project the TFN flow diverter will be ready t begin first- in-human studies as an improved treatment for the millions who suffer from intracranial aneurysms worldwide.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY:  Lymphoma is the sixth most common form of cancer in the United States, affecting an estimated 23 per 100,000 people. While there have been significant advances in our understanding of lymphoma biology and our ability to provide curative therapy, many patients with lymphoma continue to suffer poor outcomes with approximately 20,000 people dying from lymphoma in the US each year. Novel approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of lymphoma are urgently needed.  This application is focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate MALT1, a central oncoprotein in B-cell lymphoma. MALT1 is a cytoplasmic protein that serves to mediate antigen receptor- dependent lymphocyte activation, proliferation and survival, via stimulation of the canonical pro-survival NF-?B transcription factor. In B-lymphocytes, the antigen receptor is known as the B-cell receptor (BCR). In these cells, BCR-induced, MALT1-dependent NF-?B activation is a required event during the normal adaptive immune response, but dysregulated activation of this pathway can lead to lymphoma. Indeed, genetic analysis has revealed that in specific subtypes of B-cell lymphoma, malignant B cells highjack BCR signaling pathways in order to promote their own growth and survival.  BCR stimulation results in assembly of the CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) protein signaling complex, where MALT1 serves as the effector by carrying out two important functions. First, MALT1 acts as a scaffold to recruit and activate downstream signaling proteins, and second, MALT1 acts as a protease to cleave specific substrate signaling proteins and alter their activities. The critical importance of achieving appropriate regulation of MALT1 activity is demonstrated by the fact that gain-of-function mutations in BCR subunits or in CARMA1, resulting in exaggerated MALT1 activity, are recurrently detected in human B-cell lymphoma. Thus, MALT1 is the subject of intense investigation as a key regulator of B-lymphomagenesis and a promising new target for pharmaceutical inhibition.  This proposal investigates the innovative hypothesis that specific proteins are capable of controlling MALT1 function, such that their loss in some subtypes of B-cell lymphoma may contribute to aberrant MALT1 activity. The presence of gain-of-function BCR or CARMA1 mutants may synergize with loss of such proteins in promoting lymphomagenesis; conversely, loss alone may be pathogenic. Our goals for this proposal are to elucidate the molecular underpinnings by which specific protein-protein interactions can abrogate MALT1 activity, to determine how this interaction influences lymphocyte growth and survival, and to utilize this information to inform the design of novel therapeutic approaches to MALT1-dependent lymphoma.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent data indicate that a substantial proportion of adults 65 years of age and older are engaging in unsafe, at-risk drinking, either based on the amount of alcohol they drink or alcohol use combined with other comorbidities or medications. Several brief interventions to address the problem of excessive drinking in the elderly, designed mainly for in-person delivery, most in primary care physicians' offices, have yielded promising results, but these interventions are resource intensive and of limited scalability. And, while additional research has shown that web-based interventions addressing alcohol misuse can be efficacious, these promising interventions have not been specifically developed for, or applied to, the elderly, despite the growing need for interventions for this population who currently comprise over 43 million people. While one may conclude that that older adults are not likely to access an Internet-based site focused on alcohol, data from an open Internet- based alcohol screening and brief intervention found that while younger adults were more likely to access the site, elderly drinkers were significantly more likely to report weekly drinking in excess of recommended limits. Indeed, new research from the PEW Research Center has found that older adults are increasingly using the Internet to find health information. Building on ISA's extensive experience in the development and test of substance abuse prevention and health promotion interventions (including previously developed and tested web-based interventions), the proposed project will develop and test an innovative web-based program - science-based, media-rich, tailored, and easily navigated - designed to reduce at-risk drinking by older adults and the subsequent negative and costly health consequences. To overcome the stigma often associated with alcohol misuse among the elderly, the alcohol misuse prevention will be imbedded within a larger health promotion program designed to improve overall health behaviors related to stress management, healthy eating, and physical activity. Phase I will involve focus groups and the development and feasibility testing of the prototype, along with specific milestones that must met before moving to Phase II. Phase II will involve the full development of the web-based program for older adults followed by a field test of the program, including a randomized controlled trial with older adults. Mather LifeWays, a leader in the development and implementation of innovative programs and services to over 30,000 older adults annually through its residences and community outreach, has enthusiastically agreed to serve as the site for both phases of the project and to work with ISA's Center for Workforce Health to market the completed program.\",\n",
       " \"Project Summary/abstract Headaches are the most common neurologic condition, affecting more than 90% of the population at some point in their lives. Even though headaches are one of the most common indications for MRI, the optimal MRI protocol for this prevalent condition is unknown. Furthermore, patients and physicians are often worried about brain tumors, but the yield of neuroimaging in those with chronic headaches is 1-3%, which is comparable to a healthy population. In response, multiple guidelines recommend against routine neuroimaging in certain headache populations, but which factors should prompt neuroimaging is not clear. Furthermore, false positives are likely common on headache MRI, yet downstream harms of false positive findings have not been studied. We propose three potential solutions to improve the care of veterans with headaches. In Aim 1, we plan to determine the optimal set of MRI sequences for patients presenting with headaches. Our hypothesis is that FLAIR only MRI studies are non-inferior to conventional MRI for identifying brain lesions in patients with headache. Two neuroradiologists will read each MRI scan obtained in veterans with a headache diagnosis that are receiving an MRI as part of their routine care. Our primary analysis will determine the sensitivity of FLAIR-only MRI compared to conventional MRI for identifying headache-causing lesions. If our hypothesis is correct, fewer sequences may lower the incidence of false positive findings without substantially reducing the yield of true positives. Fewer false positives may also decrease the downstream harms associated with current neuroimaging practices. In Aim 2, we plan to define the incidence of downstream harms after false positive findings, which our preliminary data indicates may be quite high. False positive results will be defined as all abnormal MRI findings in the clinical radiologist's report that did not lead to a change in clinical management as determined by two neurologists with adjudication via consensus committee. Downstream harms of diagnostic imaging will be defined as additional diagnostic testing, procedures and consultations. We will also identify the patient phenotypes that are predictive of headache-causing lesions including headache characteristics, headache classification, and high risk clinical features (?red flags?). Previous small studies from selected populations have attempted to address this question, but we will be able to overcome many of the limitations of prior work. By characterizing the harms and high risk patient phenotypes, we will be able to inform rational clinical neuroimaging decisions to improve the health of veterans. Third, in Aim 3, we will identify the core reasons behind MRI overuse in the headache population but surveying providers and patients using the Theoretical Domains Framework. All three of these approaches will directly lead to future implementation studies. Our project is innovative is many ways. If we are able to determine an optimal protocol that is different than conventional imaging, our project may lead the way in changing the paradigm of current neuroimaging from an anatomical based approach (brain) to a symptoms based approach (headaches). Furthermore, we will also be the first group to comprehensively study the harms associated with current neuroimaging practices while also refining our understanding of high risk patient phenotypes. Understanding both of these factors will allow clinicians to have the necessary evidence of the risks and benefits of neuroimaging in different clinical scenarios.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY There currently exists a fundamental gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the specification of cardiovascular subtypes, such as atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, epicardium, endothelium smooth muscle cells during development. This represents an important problem because it prevents the complete comprehension, and therefore also the treatment of congenital heart disease, which affects ~1% of newborns. Importantly, this knowledge gap hinders the translational approach of generating defined cardiovascular cell types from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) based on the concept of reproducing known principles of normal development in culture.  The long-term goal of our work is to better understand the underlying mechanisms directing specification and differentiation of the cardiovascular lineages. The overall objective of this application is to identify the specific mechanisms that determine ventricular cell fate specification and differentiation during mouse development in vivo and to translate these insights to the hPSC differentiation system to efficiently generate human ventricular cardiomyocytes in vitro. The central hypothesis is that ventricular progenitor cells can be identified, isolated and characterized early during development, by lineage-tracing of Foxa2, and that this progenitor population can be reproduced during hPSC differentiations. This hypothesis has been formulated based on preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratory, demonstrating that prospective ventricular cells can be identified as early as during gastrulation, using Foxa2 as a marker. Foxa2 expression and subsequent lineage-tracing enable monitoring of these cells over the course of their specification and differentiation. In Aim 1, prospective ventricular cells will be isolated and analyzed molecularly at key stages during development to identify the relevant signaling pathways and gene regulatory mechanisms responsible for ventricular specification and differentiation. In Aim 2, the hPSC model system will be used, along with ventricular-specific reporter cell lines, cell surface antibody screening technology, and small molecule pathway modulations to establish robust protocols for the generation and characterization of pure human ventricular cardiomyocytes.  This approach effectively combines complementary model systems to examine specification mechanisms of ventricular cells during heart development. We expect results from our studies to advance the understanding of heart development by uncovering key regulators of early cardiac specification. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to have a broad translational impact in the understanding of congenital heart disease, and for the generation of therapeutically relevant and safe cell populations from hPSCs.\",\n",
       " 'Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is one of the most common diseases for which people visit a health care provider and receive antibiotics. Recent studies have reported that veterans deployed to the Iraq or Afghan theaters of operation are twice as likely to develop upper respiratory disorders. Veterans of OEF/OIF presenting with post deployment onset of rhinosinusitis undisputedly recount that their symptoms were initiated within several weeks of being deployed supporting an environmental contribution. While bacteria in the sinonasal cavity contribute to the pathophysiology, one puzzle is how microbial species that are more common in people with this disease are also constituents of the normal sinonasal microbiota of healthy people. These phenotypic differences may be due to the inborn genetics of the human host, specifically variation in the taste receptor gene family that are accentuated with exposure to varied environments. Some of these bitter taste receptors, in addition to detecting chemicals on the tongue (taste), also detect secreted bacterial chemicals and trigger the ciliated cells of the sinonasal epithelium to launch an attack. One by-product of this particular physiological system is that people who are not able to taste certain types of bitter compounds may be less able to fight certain bacteria with the same weak sensory signaling pathway. The goal of the proposed research is to combine the expertise of three laboratories to test whether there are interactions between genetic variation of the human host, individual nasal microbiota, and the development of chronic rhinosinusitis: (1) A surgeon scientist with expertise in the medical and surgical treatment of individuals with CRS with access to patients with and without exposure to a foreign environment will ascertain and evaluate the patients. (2) A genomics expert will quantify the human microbiome to the species level using new technologies. (3) A human geneticist and her team will genotype human genomic DNA and evaluate subjects for their ability to taste bitter compounds. The hypothesis is that people with different inborn differences in their ability to detect the chemicals secreted by bacteria will have a different microbiome patterns and susceptibility to CRS. To that end, we will evaluate 60 patients with CRS (cases) and 60 age-, sex, and race-matched healthy controls. This ?bitterome? research could explain, at least in part, how bacterial virulence arises in specific individuals and perhaps lead to simple clinical tests to determine how best to personalize treatment.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY Through cohesive advancements in protein engineering, bioconjugation chemistry and sophisticated nanotechnology, innovations in targeted nanotherapeutics have made significant progress in increasing the specificity of anticancer nanomedicines. However, as a consequence of the complexity of modular targeted nanoconjugates (TNCs), in vivo selectivity, and subsequent treatment outcomes, frequently suffer setbacks. The capacity to accurately resolve intratumoral molecular and cellular selectivity of TNCs in vivo is oftentimes thwarted by dominant macrophysiological factors. Such factors include macro-scale quantification of TNC tumor delivery, which provides little insight into micro-scale cancer cell-specific molecular binding events and internalization of TNCs present within the interstitium. Additional factors include variable pharmacokinetics of non-selective nanoconjugate controls, and unparalleled physiologies of target-null tumors; both which hamper the accurate experimental comparisons needed to evaluate novel TNCs. To this end, Dual-Tracer Fluorescence Imaging (DT-FI) will be deployed, which provides accurate in vivo quantitation of tumor target molecular binding of TNCs via a Binding Potential metric, a combined measure of binding affinity and respective tumor target receptor concentration. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is debilitating and manifests at critical anatomical sites, requiring highly selective treatments to preserve function and aesthetics. Aside from indiscriminate surgery, chemo- and radiotherapy, confined spatiotemporal control of cytotoxicity of HNSCC can be imparted by photodynamic therapy (PDT), a promising modality used to manage cancers by the light-activation of photosensitizer (PS) agents. In an effort to improve the cellular selectivity of HNSCC therapy, PS-embedded, chemo-loaded liposomes will be employed in this proposal as a model nanoplatform to surface-graft engineered recombinant targeting moieties. DT-FI will be leveraged as a critical means of directing the engineering of the photoactive TNCs to improve outcomes of PDT-based treatments in HNSCC. To guide Dr. Obaid's transition to independence, a mentoring committee has been assembled to complement his training in chemical nanoscience. Mentorship by Dr. Tayyaba Hasan will train Dr. Obaid on PDT-based cancer nanomedicines and tumor biology response. Co-mentorship by Dr. Brian Pogue will train Dr. Obaid in quantitative in vivo DT-FI. Additional distinguished members include Dr. Brian Seed, a specialist in protein engineering, Dr. Andrew Tsourkas, a nanoconjugation expert, Dr. Eben Rosenthal, Otolaryngologist and pioneer in HNSCC imaging, and Dr. William Faquin, a HNSCC pathophysiology expert. As a well-defined and distinct transition to independence, the infrastructure established in the mentored phase will be adapted to the engineering of multi-specific photo-chemotherapeutic nanoplatforms tailored for in vivo heterogeneity of HNSCC models. The approach established in this K99/R00 mechanism will enable future designs of various TNCs, as directed by in vivo DT-FI, with the capacity for targeting dynamic disease-specific molecular targets.\",\n",
       " 'SUMMARY The genetic basis of social behavior is complex and involves many genes spread throughout the genome. As a result, it has been difficult to link specific genes to social behavior in humans. Increasing accessibility to genomic resources has now made it feasible to draw such connections in novel animal models. Well-chosen models make possible an experimental, mechanistic strategy that begins at the level of gene variation and works up through layers of biological organization, connecting each level to the one below, to explain the effect of genetic variation on behavioral phenotype. The proposed research will leverage a large body of previous work, conducted by the PI and collaborators, in a natural animal model uniquely suited for connecting genes and social behavior. In the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), a common North American songbird, an inversion on chromosome 2 (ZAL2m) has significantly altered social strategies. Limited gene flow between the ZAL2 and ZAL2m haplotypes has driven genetic differentiation of the rearranged region. As a direct result, ZAL2m individuals of both sexes employ a life history strategy different from that of their ZAL2 counterparts ? they are more aggressive and less parental. The long-term goal is to use this inversion as a target to show how a small genetic change can have large downstream effects on complex behavioral phenotypes. The PI and collaborators have already identified a limited number of genes located inside the inversion that meet the following criteria: (1) expression differs between birds with and without the inversion, (2) the genes show high allele-specific expression in heterozygotes, and (3) expression is tightly correlated with vocal aggression. These genes include a neuropeptide previously implicated in aggression, a serotonin receptor, and a glutamate receptor. The objective of the proposed renewal application is to systematically evaluate the causal effects of variation in these genes on aggressive phenotypes, working up through multiple levels of biological organization from genotype to phenotype. First, the team will precisely identify the genetic variation responsible for differential expression of these genes. Second, they will use bottom-up and targeted proteomics to show the impact of genetic differentiation on the expression of protein isoforms in the brain. Finally, they will manipulate production of the relevant proteins to test their roles in aggressive behavioral phenotypes. A major strength of the research strategy is that the team will combine discovery-based, genome-wide approaches with hypothesis-driven, targeted approaches, using the former to inform the latter. The project is innovative because it takes advantage of a unique, powerful model organism that can be studied in its natural habitat. The significance of this work is that it will move beyond genotype-phenotype associations to test for causal connections between gene variants and social behavior, at multiple levels of biological organization, in a vertebrate. Using this strategy, the investigators will advance understanding of not only which genes contribute to behavioral phenotypes, but how they do so.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Uterine fibroids (UFs; leiomyomas) are the most important benign neoplastic threat to women's health worldwide, but disproportionately affect women of color, particularly African American (AA) women, who have a threefold higher incidence rate and relative risk of UFs than Caucasian (CC) women. While the underlying cause for this risk disparity is not fully understood, recent studies implicate hypovitaminosis D as a major contributor. Thus, AA women have a tenfold increased risk of vitamin D deficiency compared to CC women, and as we first reported, UF risk is inversely correlated with 25-hydroxy vitamin D serum levels. Nonetheless, it is not clear whether and how the processes that drive UF formation and determine relative risk are genetically or biochemically linked. In this regard, we and others have identified somatic mutations in the transcriptional Mediator subunit MED12 as the dominant drivers of UFs, accounting for ~70% of tumors. Notably, MED12- mutant UFs are characterized by significant chromosomal loss and rearrangement, suggesting genomic instability as a driving force in tumor progression. Herein, we clarify the molecular basis for mutant MED12- driven genomic instability, and further identify vitamin D3 receptor signaling as a likely suppressor of this process. We show that MED12-mutant UF stem cells (SCs) accumulate high levels of unrepaired DNA double- strand breaks (DSBs) through downregulation of key DNA damage response (DDR) and repair genes. Notably, we find the vitamin D3/receptor axis to be a variable modulator of MED12-regulated DDR gene expression. Thus, we show that reduced vitamin D3/receptor signaling suppresses, while elevated signaling activates, DDR genes downregulated in MED12-mutant UF SCs. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that hypovitaminosis D exacerbates DNA damage accumulation and genomic instability arising in MED12-mutant UFs, leading to enhanced tumor progression and burden. Accordingly, we propose that vitamin D3, through reparation of an impaired DDR will provide therapeutic benefit in MED12-mutant tumors. To test these hypotheses, we will (1) Elucidate the molecular basis of genomic instability in MED12-mutant UFs. We will determine if DSB accumulation in MED12-mutant UF SCs derives from defects in DNA damage-induced checkpoint signaling and repair and/or R-loop-induced replication stress. (2) Investigate the relationship between vitamin D3 and MED12 in UF genome maintenance. We will ask whether and how vitamin D3 signaling strength modulates the DDR defects in MED12-mutant UF SCs, relate this activity to patient race and serum vitamin D levels, and elucidate the mechanism by which the vitamin D3/receptor axis and MED12 coordinately control the DDR network at the genomic and epigenomic levels; (3) Examine the therapeutic potential of vitamin D3 in a preclinical mouse model of human UFs. Using a renal capsule mouse model of human UFs, we will evaluate vitamin D3 and its potent non-hypercalcemic analogs for therapeutic efficacy, safety, and mechanism of action, including impact on tumor DNA damage load and DDR gene networks.\",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT This project will create the first objective measurement tool, the VisBox, for the vision subtype of concussion (VSC). This will enable physicians to identify VSC without an eye-care professional, for referral to a vision specialist for personalized vision therapy recommendations. The persistence of concussion symptoms beyond several weeks is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, and children are particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties. A lack of accessible, objective vision diagnostics are critical barriers to identification of VSC and referral for treatment. The VisBox will be a software product that is used with the OcuTracker, Oculogica?s proprietary eye-tracking hardware platform. The VisBox will input eye movement measurements from the OcuTracker, calculate metrics that correspond to aspects of cranial nerve function affected during a concussion, and use those metrics to calculate a score to predict VSC using an algorithm developed with guided machine learning in the course of this study. The VisBox will be used by non- vision specialists to objectively measure three vision disorders related to concussion: convergence insufficiency (CI), accommodative insufficiency (AI), and saccadic dysfunction (SD) in under 4 minutes, during the clinical visit where the concussion is diagnosed. The long-term goal is to develop an objective assessment of vision characteristics, that will enable physicians that are non-specialists in vision to 1) screen for concussion-related vision disorders; 2) identify VSC; 3) make decisions about the necessity of a referral for a comprehensive vision examination; 4) monitor the effectiveness of vision treatment. Phase I Hypothesis. VisBox can produce an output score that correlates with the presence or absence of TBI- related vision disorder, i.e., VSC, by leveraging the OcuTracker visual stimulus and eye tracking system. Specific Aim I. Generate OcuTracker eye tracking data and the diagnosis of TBI-related vision disorder in 250 pediatric concussion patients. Specific Aim II. Develop and validate VisBox algorithm for assessing CI, AI, and SD using OcuTracker data. Plans for Phase II. The VisBox score will be used to predict responsiveness to vision therapy in a prospective randomized clinical study. Phase II will be a multi-armed study comparing vision therapy with placebo therapy in concussion patients and assessing whether the VisBox software can predict which patients are responsive to vision therapy. Commercial Opportunity. VisBox customers are non-eye care specialists including neurologists, pediatricians, emergency room physicians, sports medicine physicians, and concussion specialists. The total addressable market is $400M, assuming 4M annual scans at $100/scan needed for concussions in the US.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed Phase I STTR project is a partnership between a biotechnology company KXTbio, Inc. and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to develop an innovative high-throughput screening service for identifying new drug candidates that act via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This large protein superfamily has been the most successful source of therapeutic targets, accounting for 40% of all prescription pharmaceuticals in such diverse areas as cancer, cardiac dysfunction, diabetes, central nervous system disorders, obesity, inflammation, and pain. However, with much of the low hanging fruit already picked, the pace of GPCR drug discovery and development has slowed due to the challenges associated with obtaining 3D structures of GPCRs and performing structure-activity studies. Concurrently, new findings in GPCR pharmacology research have uncovered previously unknown intricacies of GPCR signaling that expanded their potential as targets for therapeutic interventions even further. Considering the decreasing productivity in the pharmaceutical industry and rising development costs, more effective methods of identifying GPCR drug candidates would be highly valuable. Although crystal structures of GPCRs are now being generated, their utility will remain limited for the foreseeable future. Various functional assays are currently the mainstay of GPCR screening efforts, and rely on detecting downstream cellular signaling events initiated by changes in GPCR activity. Chosen for their strong and easy to measure signals, these techniques are performed in live cell cultures, making them prone to off-target effects resulting in both false positives and false negatives, introducing higher variability and costs, as well as reduced throughput. KXTbio and UNC Chapel Hill aim to develop a new screening technology that would eliminate many of the drawbacks of the existing methods. The new high-throughput screening (HTS) platform will use purified GPCRs and G proteins, thus avoiding cell cultures. GPCR activity will be monitored by the immediately ensuing G protein activation involving an exchange of the bound GDP molecule for a GTP. The fluorescent analog of GTP whose fluorescent yield increases upon G protein binding will be used in the assay as the signal source. This proposed real-time HTS system can differentiate between agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators, using a minimal number of components, thus reducing artefacts and cell-dependent effects. In contrast to related G protein activation assays it does not require filtration and washing steps or radiolabels. In this Phase I project KXTbio aims to deliver a proof of concept of the proposed HTS GPCR platform, and if successful, a Phase II project will follow, where the platform will be fully implemented, tested, and optimized in a multi-well plate format. KXTbio plans to commercialize it is as a service with a possibility of licensing the technology to drug discovery companies.',\n",
       " 'Statement of Problem: The arterial chemoreflex is an essential protective mechanism for adaptive responses to hypoxia (Hx). However, chemoreflex dysfunction, including over-excitation of chemoreflex pathways leads to respiratory instability, increased sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and hypertension in disease states, including heart failure and hypertension. Information regarding mechanisms of action in the chemoreflex neurocircuitry is lacking. The neuropeptide neurons CRH and OT neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) may influence sympathoexcitatory and respiratory control via projections to brainstem cardiorespiratory nuclei. Previous studies indicate that CRH increases cardiorespiratory function in both healthy subjects and elderly patients dependent on artificial respiration, suggesting that CRH may offer therapeutic potential in various disease states that display chemoreflex dysfunction. However, the central mechanisms by which PVN neuropeptide neurons contribute to these responses are unclear. Specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine the contribution of PVN CRH neurons to cardiorespiratory control at baseline and in response to peripheral chemoreflex stimulation Aim 2: To determine the contribution of PVN OT neurons to cardiorespiratory control, and examine central interactions between CRH and OT in the nTS Experimental Approach: The overall Hypothesis of this project is that PVN CRH neurons that project to the nTS enhance cardiorespiratory responses to chemoreflex stimulation via activation of nTS CRH receptors and OTergic mechanisms. Aim 1 will determine the extent to which PVN CRH neurons contribute to cardiorespiratory output at baseline and during peripheral chemoreflex stimulation via projections to the nTS. Aim 2 will determine the extent to which PVN CRH and OT neurons modulate cardiorespiratory responses to chemoreflex via interactions within the nTS. Significance of Results: The long-term objectives of this study are to further characterize interactions between the PVN and the nTS, and the mechanisms by which this reciprocal pathway shapes cardiorespiratory responses to peripheral chemoreflex stimulation. Determining the pathways, circuits and mechanism(s) mediating chemoreflex function and how these may be changed in disease would be of great benefit in designing rational and targeted therapeutic approaches in these debilitating diseases.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately one in three new HIV infections occurring outside of sub-Saharan Africa is related to injection drug use. Because this epidemic is primarily driven by the injection of opiates, several countries have initiated methadone maintenance treatment as part of their HIV prevention, treatment, and care strategy. In many of these settings more than 30% of patients entering methadone treatment are HIV+. Most will be on antiretroviral therapies (ART) at some point during their treatment with methadone. Interactions between the two most commonly used ART in the world, nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV), and methadone are well known but poorly characterized in clinical populations. These interactions frequently lead to opiate withdrawal symptoms, patient destabilization, and return to drug use that results in a cascade of poor ART adherence and increased morbidity related to drug use and inconsistent HIV care. Adjustment of methadone dose in the setting of methadone-ART interactions can return the patient to stability. There are no clear data to help a clinician determine the extent to which a methadone dose should be adjusted following methadone-ART interactions. Currently, clinicians must guess on methadone dose adjustments until the desired clinical response is achieved. The overall goal of our work is to The following research proposal focuses on the creation of a population pharmacokinetic model of methadone in a real-world clinical setting with a high prevalence of HIV and use of NVP and EFV. This will be accomplished through two specific aims: 1) Use population pharmacokinetics in a real-world clinical setting to measure differences in methadone exposure (e.g., area under the concentration-time curve, AUC; and relationship between dose and apparent oral clearance, CL/F) between those on NVP or EFV and those not on NVP or EFV, respectively; and 2) Evaluate the influence of selected genetic polymorphisms on methadone pharmacokinetics and methadone-NVP and -EFV interactions.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary/Abstract DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) can be caused by oxidative stress, or intermediate products of various DNA metabolisms including DNA replication and damage repair. Unrepaired oxidative DNA damage and SSBs may result in replication fork collapse or transcription machinery failure. Oxidative DNA damage and SSBs are critical challenges to genomic stability and can lead to tumorigenesis when they are not repaired quickly or properly. Current understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying checkpoint signaling and regulatory mechanisms in response to oxidative DNA damage and SSBs is limited or indirect because of the lack of feasible experimental systems. Whereas APE1 (AP endonuclease 1) is known for its critical functions in base excision repair and transcriptional regulation, it is currently unknown whether APE1 plays an essential role in DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. Our published work and substantial preliminary data suggest that APE1 is essential for activating the ATR-dependent DDR pathway in oxidative stress, that a distinct ATR-Chk1 checkpoint response is activated by a defined plasmid-based SSB structure, and that APE1 associates with ATRIP and TopBP1. Our major hypothesis is that APE1 plays an vital role in checkpoint signaling in response to oxidative stress and SSBs. To test this directly, our specific aims include: (1) to determine whether APE1 plays an important role in the initiation of SSB end resection in the 3'-5 direction via its exonuclease activity for the SSB signaling; (2) to determine how APE1 interacts with ATRIP in DDR pathway, and (3) to determine how TopBP1 is regulated to activate the ATR-Chk1 checkpoint signaling and whether the role of APE1 in DDR is conserved in pancreatic cancer cells. We have established two complementary approaches to study checkpoint signaling pathway: (1) hydrogen peroxide-induced multiple SSBs randomly distributed on chromatin in a replicating Xenopus LSS system, and (2) plasmid-based site-specific SSB structures in a nonreplicating Xenopus HSS system. Using innovative biochemical and structure-function analysis in Xenopus egg extracts, we will demonstrate how oxidative DNA damage and SSBs are recognized and processed by APE1 in coordination with ATRIP and TopBP1 to regulate checkpoint signaling. We will also validate our findings from Xenopus egg extract system in mammalian cells including pancreatic cancer cells. The anticipated outcomes of this research project will help us better understand how genome stability is maintained in cellular response to oxidative DNA damage and SSBs. All together, this research project will advance our scientific knowledge conceptually on how cancers develop, and open avenues to new therapeutic strategies, especially for pancreatic cancer.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract  Cellular RNAs can serve as powerful biomarkers of diverse disease states. Recent developments in probe technology enable the detection of RNAs with single-molecule sensitivity by fluorescence in situ hybridization (sm-FISH). This technology holds great promise in clinical diagnostics for the detection of pathogens and cancers. However, its utility for imaging pathological sections is presently limited, because in order to obtain single-molecule sensitivity, imaging needs to be performed with high magnification objectives that have a limited field of view, permitting the observation of only a few cells at a time. The relatively low intensity of these signals also limits the utility of sm-FISH when the cells are analyzed by flow cytometry, because rare cells, such as immunological memory cells or stem cells, which express a low level of mRNA markers, cannot be detected. A further limitation is that single nucleotide variations cannot be detected.  We are developing a new generation of sm-FISH in which the signals is amplified without any amplification of background. In our approach, that we refer to as strictly target-dependent amplified FISH (stamp-FISH), when a pair of binary probes bind to the target a sequestered sequence is exposed. The exposed sequence then serves as an initiator of a hybridization chain reaction, which leads to creation of a large, highly fluorescent DNA cluster that remains tethered at the target. We obtain as much as 10-fold amplification of signal without any enhancement in background. Furthermore, the probes yield exquisite discrimination between single nucleotide variations.  We will develop this technology further and apply it for detection of point mutations in EGFR and BRAF mRNAs. Currently, about fifteen percent of the copies of target mRNA that are present within the cells can be detected. We will improve this efficiency using strategies aimed at increasing the binding of probes to the target mRNAs. Probe sets will be developed for an exemplary set of mutations within the EGFR and BRAF genes and then cell lines and cancer tissues, in which these mutations are expressed, will be imaged using these probe sets. We will also develop multiplex assays that will detect three mutants and the wild-type mRNA simultaneously. In addition, for T cell profiling we are proposing to detect 15 RNA markers in multiplex in T cells. With this expansion of the multiplexing range to 15 targets, we will be able to detect subtypes of cells that differ from each other by the expression of chemokine/cytokines, transcription factors, or metabolic markers. This development will create powerful new analytical possibilities for diverse fields in both research and clinical settings and thus will be of broad utility.',\n",
       " 'Abstract The SCN8A gene encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6 that is expressed in neurons throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. Nav1.6 is concentrated at the axon initial segment and nodes of Ranvier. Mutations of SCN8A affect many aspects of brain and peripheral nerve function. In 2012 we described the first mutation of SCN8A in a child with early onset epileptic encephalopathy. Since then more than 150 de novo missense mutations have been identified in this severe form of epilepsy (OMIM # 614558). Our functional characterization of 10 patient mutations demonstrated that gain-of-function mutations resulting in channel hyperactivity are the major pathogenic mechanism underlying SCN8A encephalopathy. We generated a mouse model of the first identified SCN8A mutation, p.Asn1768Asp, that is widely used for evaluation of therapeutic interventions. We will use this model to isolate a recently discovered genetic modifier that results in complete rescue of seizures and sudden death. We will also assess the pre-clinical effectiveness of antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi reagents that suppress the expression of the dominant SCN8A mutation in the N1768D mouse model. To explore the basis for the severe hypotonia associated with many SCN8A mutations, we have generated a new conditional mouse model with CRE-dependent expression of the more severe patient mutation p.Arg1872Trp. We will use this new model to examine the role of mutant Nav1.6 in specific subsets of neurons at varying stages of development. This conditional model will also be used to directly test the contribution of cardiac expression of hyperactive Nav1.6 to the risk of sudden death. These studies will provide new knowledge regarding pathogenic mechanisms underlying SCN8A encephalopathy, and will test the effectiveness of gene suppression as a therapeutic intervention for this severe neurological disorder.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Involuntary muscle activity (spasms) is the most debilitating aspect of spasticity after spinal cord injury (SCI) because the contractions interfere with everyday tasks, and limit rehabilitation. Treatments are not always effective, lowering health- related quality of life. Our long-term Objective is to use closed-loop control of tendon vibration to implement clinically meaningful management of muscle spasms, and to understand the spinal circuits responsible for spasm generation. Specifically, we aim to build on our existing capabilities and collaborations to: 1a) Refine the design of the housing in our wearable device to deliver vibration to the Achilles tendon by using consumer-oriented input; 1b) Determine the vibration parameters that reduce spasms in leg muscles paralyzed by SCI in the laboratory using the wearable device. In either a seated or reclined position, spasms will be detected using electromyography (EMG), then the Achilles tendon will be vibrated at different frequencies, durations and amplitudes to dampen the spasms in real-time using closed-loop control; 2) Examine the efficacy of tendon vibration in altering muscle spasms by treating spasms as they occur, which personalizes the intervention for maximal clinical and user impact. The acute (chronic) effects of vibration on spasms will be evaluated during 24-hour EMG recordings by comparing unconditioned to conditioned spasms at baseline, during the vibration intervention, and post intervention. Pre/Post measures of different aspects of spasticity will provide insight into the site(s), magnitude, and time-course of changes that occur with vibration; and user perspective on the effects of the therapy. Combining the power of non-invasive physiological recordings with functional, clinical and participant reported outcomes will also reveal neural and muscular plasticity, the mechanisms underlying the action of vibration on spasms, and importantly, the rationale to improve this novel approach to spasm management after SCI and other neurological disorders. Many individuals with SCI may find non-pharmacological treatment for spasms attractive because it may lead to reductions or elimination of spasm medications.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza viruses are constantly changing, requiring the reformulation of vaccines every year. Accurately estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza infection is critical in order to evaluate the protection provided by annua, nationwide vaccination programs. Our long-term goal is to discover more advanced strategies to measure vaccine effectiveness, to potentially reduce the overall burden of influenza infection. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines with the ACIP recommended universal immunization strategy in the Scott and White Memorial Hospital -Temple Population Research Area (SWH-TPRA) adult source population will be systematically investigated. The objective of the proposed work is to explore strategies for measuring vaccine effectiveness against lab-confirmed influenza (VE-LCI) in adult inpatients, including the elderly, who have the highest hospitalization  rates. This includes the identification, implementation and evaluation of innovative, feasible, and  sustainable strategies for measuring VE-LCI in persons aged 18 years or older in acute inpatient care settings. The central hypothesis is that timely and efficient measurement of VE- LCI in adult inpatients is feasible and sustainable in the U.S. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify innovative, feasible, and sustainable strategies to measure VE-LCI in a timely and efficient manner for persons ? 18 years admitted with an acute respiratory illness (ARI) in acute inpatient care settings, 2) Implement the above strategies to measure VE-LCI for adult inpatients with ARI, and 3) Evaluate the above strategies to measure VE-LCI for adult inpatients with ARI. To achieve these goals, VE-LCI will be determined in adults admitted to SWMH with ARI who test positive for influenza A and/or B by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The odds of being vaccinated against influenza for PCR-confirmed cases will be compared to age-matched PCR-negative controls, after adjusting for confounders. During 2015- 2016 through 2019-2020, 300 patients and 800 adults admitted to SWMH with an ARI will be eligible to participate in the BSWH CDC VE-LCI adult inpatient study, respectively. Using a test-negative study design, VE-LCI for adult inpatients with ARI will be measured. Influenza immunization rates will be calculated for the RT-PCR confirmed cases and test negative controls, adjusting VE-LCI for confounders. The approach is innovative because effective measures of the public health impact of increasing influenza immunization on burden of illness will be defined. The proposed research is significant, because it will support improved understanding of timely and efficient measures of VE-LCI, which in turn will support the goal of reducing influenza-associated health burdens.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract - Core and Additional Components Influenza, an important cause of morbidity and mortality, and influenza vaccination are key components of influenza prevention. The effectiveness of influenza vaccine varies from year to year, and it can vary by virus subtype, age group, product type, population characteristics, and antigenic match. Annual assessment of clinical vaccine effectiveness is therefore needed to evaluate the impact of current vaccine recommendations and policies, understand the relationship between antigenic changes in viruses and clinical protection, and prepare for vaccine assessment during a pandemic. Interim, mid-season estimates of vaccine effectiveness are useful for public health agencies and physicians. The first Aim of the project is to estimate the effectiveness of influenza vaccine for preventing medically-attended, laboratory confirmed influenza illness in a defined population cohort of adults and children. Patients who seek outpatient care for acute respiratory illness will be recruited during the influenza season. Patients with cough and illness duration ?7 days will be eligible. After informed consent, nose and throat swabs will be tested for influenza A and B using a nucleic acid amplification test (RT- PCR). Samples will be provided to CDC for antigenic characterization and other tests as appropriate. Influenza immunization status will be determined by a validated immunization registry. Vaccine effectiveness will be calculated using the test negative design where cases include participants with RT-PCR confirmed influenza and controls include study participants with noninfluenza respiratory illness (negative RT-PCR). Data will be provided to CDC for combined analyses with other participating sites, including mid-season data for interim analysis of effectiveness. When possible, separate estimates of vaccine effectiveness will be calculated for different age groups, influenza subtypes, and for different vaccine products. The second Aim is to evaluate the disease burden due to RSV during the last three seasons of the project. Participant samples will be tested for RSV using RT-PCR, and the incidence of medically attended RSV will be estimated. The third Aim is to serve as an emergency response resource for CDC pandemic studies of vaccination and antivirals. This will include pilot studies to prepare for a pandemic.',\n",
       " '7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Neurological disorders such as Alzheimer?s disease, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and schizophrenia impact important cognitive processes and behavior. While the symptoms of these severe diseases vary, they share disruptions in synapse development or spine formation4. Dendritic spines are small, dynamic, post- synaptic protrusions on neurons that respond to changes in presynaptic activity1. Although spine dynamics have been well studied, very little is known about the genes involved in spine formation and maintenance. Recently, my laboratory discovered spiny projections on a group of GABAergic neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using C. elegans as a model system, the goal of this project is to dissect cellular and molecular components important for dendritic spine formation and maintenance. Specifically, in the first aim, I will define the structural dynamics, and cellular components that drive development and maintenance of these spine-like protrusions. In my second aim, I will utilize findings from a genome-wide genetic screen to investigate the role of unc-14, a cargo adaptor protein in these spine-like structures, and elucidate the molecular identity and functions of 2 additional spine mutants, 21-6-1K and 31-6-1G2. Given the strong homology between C. elegans and mammalian genes, I expect that my approach will identify conserved mechanisms underlying dendritic spine formation. These studies will address fundamental questions about dendritic spine biology and offer valuable training in microscopy, genetics, and molecular approaches that will advance my scientific development and provide a foundation for my future scientific endeavors.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Focused Ultrasound (FUS), in conjunction with microbubbles, remains the sole technique that can induce localized BBB opening noninvasively and regionally. Intranasal (IN) administration has emerged as a promising approach for drug delivery to the brain. Traditionally, it has been successfully used as a convenient method for drug delivery to the systemic circulation, because IN administered drugs can be absorbed through a rich vascular network in the nasal cavity into the systemic circulation. Although most drugs absorbed into the blood circulation cannot enter the brain parenchyma because of the BBB, it has been demonstrated feasible in animal and clinical studies that drugs can be directly delivered from the nose to the brain, bypassing the BBB. Over the past few years, our team has shown that the BBB can be reproducibly opened using FUS and intravenously (IV)-administered microbubbles in a specific subcortical region associated with neurodegenerative disease. Molecules on the order of 0.5 kDa-4 MDa, including Dextran, neurotrophic factors and viral vectors, have been shown to be successfully delivered and localized within the intracellular space of neurons triggering signaling pathways within the neuronal cell. In this study, we hypothesize that the BBB opening can be applied entirely noninvasively (i.e., injection-free) while reducing the risk of systemic toxicity. FUS and intranasal delivery are therefore combined for the first time for enhancing the delivery efficiency of intranasally administered drugs to a targeted region while nanodroplets (ND) substitute microbubbles due to their smaller size that should facilitate intranasal delivery (FUS+IN+ND). We propose to develop an entirely noninvasive approach for trans-BBB deliver that offers the advantages of 1) an injection- free approach due to the intranasal (inhalation) administration , 2) higher selectivity due to the nanodroplet vehicle used and 3) lower toxicity due to both intranasal and nanodroplet approaches. The specific aims are thus to: 1) demonstrate feasibility of BBB opening using nanodroplets administered intranasally; 2) demonstrate efficacy of facilitating protein and gene therapy in a Parkinsonian mouse model. Intranasal delivery of both the vehicle (nanodroplet) and the drug (protein or virus) in combination with FUS could provide an entirely noninvasive, more targeted and less toxic alternative to the currently used methodologies facilitating thus clinical translation and acceptance.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Antimicrobials (including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals) are among the most commonly prescribed medications in all healthcare settings. Unlike most therapeutic agents, their use can contribute to their own future ineffectiveness. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria now cause ~ 23,000 deaths annually in the US. Worldwide it is estimated by 2050, 10 million deaths annually will be attributable to antimicrobial resistance unless we improve our use of these life-saving drugs. A key strategy in combating antimicrobial resistance is performing antimicrobial stewardship. Antimicrobial stewardship assures that the correct antimicrobial is prescribed and administered at the correct time, with the correct dose, and for the correct duration. This practice will mitigate the selective pressure driving antimicrobial resistance, reduce antimicrobial adverse drug reactions, and promote better clinical outcomes. The Annual International Pediatric Antimicrobial Stewardship Conference has been dedicated to implementing and improving antimicrobial stewardship for children cared for in all healthcare settings for the past 8 years. As the only conference in the world dedicated to pediatric antimicrobial stewardship, the conference has seen an increase in attendance as these topics have come to the forefront of medical and pharmacy practice. The conference is intended for all healthcare professionals and includes a basic workshop for those individuals just learning and starting antimicrobial stewardship programs in both inpatient and outpatient settings. National experts present new research and best practice in the areas of implementation, treatment strategies for antibiotic-resistant infections, epidemiology of resistance, the influence of antimicrobials on the microbiome, and social determinants of antimicrobial prescribing. Importantly, the meeting attracts many trainees, who have the opportunity to present their research in oral and poster form and to interact and collaborate with national experts in the field. Most importantly, the conference is structured to encourage and facilitate networking and establishment of collaborations that will prove essential in the fight against antibiotic-resistant infections.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Tuberculosis: Translating Scientific Findings for Clinical and Public Health Impact, organized by Drs. Graeme Meintjes, Eric J. Rubin and Sabine Ehrt. The conference will be held April 15-19, 2018 at Fairmont Chateau in Whistler, British Columbia. It is estimated that one-third of the world?s population is infected with tuberculosis, and each year 10 million people develop disease with 1.5 million tuberculosis-related deaths. Global control efforts using currently available diagnostic, treatment and preventive tools are predicted to achieve only gradual reductions in global tuberculosis incidence. Critical factors impeding tuberculosis control include the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to evade host-killing mechanisms and enter into a phenotypic state of persistence with risk of later reactivation, HIV co-infection which drives progression to disease, the emergence and transmission of drug- resistant strains, and our limited understanding of the immune responses necessary to kill or more effectively contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis and how to elicit these responses with a novel vaccine. Acceleration of progress in TB control requires deeper fundamental insights into the pathogen and pathogen-host interactions, which can then translated into more effective tools at a public health level. Under the theme of translation, this conference will bring together laboratory, clinical and epidemiological tuberculosis researchers to engage the key scientific questions in tuberculosis science including persistence, metabolic adaptation, immune evasion, prediction and early diagnosis of progression to disease, drug resistance, discovery of novel drug targets, and determinants of morbidity and mortality. This will allow for cross-talk between disciplines and triangulation of research findings from epidemiological and clinical studies and laboratory and animal models. This conference will explore what fundamental insights are needed to advance TB control and how fundamental insights can be translated into clinical and public health impact. For the first time, the meeting is held jointly with the Keystone Symposia ?HIV and Co-Infections: Pathogenesis, Inflammation and Persistence,? which will facilitate discussion around HIV and tuberculosis co-infection and explore synergies in the respective fields.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Exosomes are from the intraluminal vesicles (ILV) of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) produced via endocytic process. Mature MVBs can fuse with lysosomes to deliver their contents for degradation and recycling or fuse with the plasma membrane where ILVs are released as exosomes. Recent studies have indicated that enhanced exosome excretion in arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is an essential mechanism triggering or promoting calcifying nidus formation and extracellular matrix (ECM) mineralization in the arterial wall under different pathological conditions. However, little is known so far how MVB fate and exosome excretion are controlled by lysosomes in SMCs and whether lysosomal dysfunction increases exosome excretion from SMCs to activate or accelerate vascular calcification process. The present grant proposal will test a central hypothesis that lysosomal acid ceramidase (AC)-mediated sphingolipid metabolism plays a crucial role in the control of lysosome trafficking or fusion to MVBs and subsequent exosome excretion, maintaining the normal phenotype and function of SMCs. AC gene defect or functional deficiency may disturb lysosome degradation of MVBs, increasing exosome excretion and resulting in calcifying nidus formation and ultimate vascular calcification under pathological conditions. To test this hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether exosome excretion in arterial SMCs is fine controlled by lysosomal AC activity and whether the deficiency of this AC regulation causes arterial calcification in smooth muscle-specific AC gene knockout mice (Asah1fl/fl/SMcre) with analysis of exosomes, SMC phenotypes, and calcification in the arterial wall and cultured coronary arterial SMCs. Specific Aim 2 attempts to test whether lysosomal AC- mediated sphingolipid signaling regulates lysosome trafficking to and fusion with MVBs to limit exosome excretion from SMCs with gene deletion (Asah1fl/fl/SMcre), CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, and SM22? promoter- driven gene rescuing. In Specific Aim 3, we will address whether the AC regulation of lysosome trafficking or fusion to MVBs is attributed to its action on lysosomal TRPML1 channel activity and associated Ca2+ release using patch clamping of isolated lysosomes and lysosome-specific Ca2+ imaging with GCaMP3-ML as an indicator. To our knowledge, these proposed studies will represent the first effort to investigate the lysosome regulation of exosome excretion from SMCs and associated pathogenic role in vascular calcification. The findings will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of arterial calcification and identify lysosomal AC as a therapeutic target for prevention or treatment of vascular calcification.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Age-related arterial dysfunction is the main risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Recently, we have used short-term and lifelong studies in mice to determine how a Western-style diet (WD; high fat and sugar, low fiber and nutrient density) and aerobic exercise (EX), common lifestyle factors, interact with aging to influence endothelial dysfunction and stiffening of the large elastic arteries. We found that WD accelerates, and EX prevents, these key features of arterial aging via changes in oxidative stress and inflammation. The gut microbiome is a strong modulator of host metabolic health and inflammation that is influenced by age, diet and EX, but there is no information about its effects on arterial function in these or other settings. Our integrative hypothesis is that dysregulation of the gut microbiome (gut dysbiosis) with primary aging and WD consumption, coupled with increased intestinal permeability that allows gut-derived particles to leak into circulation, may act to impair arterial function via changes to adverse gut-derived metabolites such as atherosclerosis-linked trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), and stimulation of toll-like receptor 4-induced pro- inflammatory signaling, whereas chronic aerobic exercise protects against these effects. The purpose of this application is to determine the potential causal role of the gut microbiome in the effects of aging, WD and EX on arterial function, and gain insight into the underlying metabolomic and inflammatory mechanisms. We will employ 3 highly innovative, complementary translational approaches: 1. Mouse studies that allow us to discern cause-and-effect: a) by assessing arterial function with aging Â± WD in the presence vs. absence of the gut microbiome and associated signaling; and b) by determining if vascular phenotypes associated with aging, WD and EX can be transferred via the gut microbiome.

Human studies assessing the time course (temporal associations) of diet (WD vs. non-WD)-induced changes in the gut microbiome vs. arterial function in young and older exercising and non-exercising healthy adults, using a randomized, single-blind, controlled feeding crossover study design. 3. Combined mouse/human studies employing ?humanized? mice to determine if the characteristics present in the human gut microbiome with age, WD and EX predictably influence arterial function. These studies will determine not only changes to gut microbe presence and relative abundance with aging, WD and EX, but also the functional effects of those changes, allowing us to gain novel insight into the role of the gut microbiome in modulating vascular function with aging and these common lifestyle influences. The expected results have the potential to establish the gut microbiome as a key mechanism and therapeutic target for age-related arterial dysfunction, and to identify lifestyle or pharmacological strategies that may preserve microbial health, enhance arterial function and reduce the risk of age-related CVD.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Bi-directional vesicular transport is vital in all eukaryotic cells to deliver proteins to secretory organelles and the cell surface, and for release from the cell. It is estimated that 30% of the mammalian proteomes must traffic the secretory pathway. GBF1 (Golgi localized Brefeldin A-sensitive Factor1) is a key regulator of retrograde traffic from the Golgi to the ER, and GBF1 activity is required for the establishment and maintenance of the secretory pathway. GBF1 belongs to a family of large Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) and is an enzyme that facilitates GDP/GTP exchange on the ARF subfamily of small Ras-like GTPases. GBF1-mediated ARF activation is required for the formation of retrograde COPI vesicles, and GBF1 represents an upstream regulator of COPI vesicle formation as it dictates the time and site of vesicle formation by restricting ARF activation. Yet, despite the critical importance of GBF1 in cellular homeostasis, we remain ignorant of how GBF1 itself is regulated in cells. Specifically, we do not know how cells signal to GBF1 to ?notify? it of a cellular need for retrograde traffic and what mechanisms ensure that GBF1 initiates COPI vesicle formation only at the right time and the right place. This proposal aims to illuminate this enigma. We will test the hypothesis that cells have mechanisms to inhibit GBF1 activity to prevent spurious ARF activation, but release such inhibition in a time and site-restricted manner in response to a signaling pathway that indicates retrograde traffic demand. Our goal is to define how cells translate their need for ARF activation and membrane transport into space- and time-restricted GBF1 function. We propose 3 specific aims to identify the processes and signaling pathways that regulate GBF1 function in an essential traffic routing in all cells, retrograde COPI traffic that is vital for the homeostasis of the secretory pathway. In Aim 1, we will identify the mechanisms that selectively target GBF1 to Golgi membranes by identifying the intrinsic targeting information within GBF1 and the membrane components that mark membrane sites for GBF1 recruitment. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms that regulate GBF1 catalytic activity at the membrane by assessing the role of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) in regulating GBF1 catalytic activity. In Aim 3, we will determine the signaling pathways that coordinate GBF1 function with the need for COPI traffic by defining the role of KDEL-R activation and the PKA and SFK pathways on GBF1 membrane association and catalytic activity. GBF1 is ubiquitously expressed and critically important to cell and organismal health; GBF1 depletion from cultured cells causes death and a mouse or Drosophila knockout is embryonic lethal. GBF1 is also important in pathological contexts since it is essential for migration of glioblastoma cells and for replication of human pathogenic enteroviruses. Our studies will provide critical new knowledge of GBF1 regulation in basic cellular physiology and will inform strategies for the design of therapeutic intervention to control GBF1-mediated events in pathological contexts.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to investigate the mechanisms by which protein ubiquitination regulates cellular resistance to oxidative stress. Increased exposure to oxidants combined to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates is the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Oxidative stress is a very prominent type of stress induced by exposure to diverse environmental factors such as ionizing radiation, heat, and pollutants. Oxidative stress damages several biomolecules including lipids, DNA and proteins, potentially resulting in cell death. To prevent cell death and disease progression, cells use ubiquitination as the signal for removing damaged proteins through the proteasome and thus preventing aggregation. However, many non-degradative roles for ubiquitination have been described which are signaled by different lysine (K) ubiquitin chains when conjugated to target proteins. Using yeast S. cerevisiae as a model, we found that the unconventional K63 polyubiquitin chain accumulates strongly and dynamically, and impacts cellular viability in response to oxidative stress. Using innovative proteomics approaches, we identified many ribosome proteins as targets of K63 ubiquitination. However, the mechanisms by which K63 ubiquitination regulates cellular viability are still unknown. Therefore, in Aim1 system-wide approaches will be employed to investigate how K63 ubiquitination affects protein expression (K99). In Aim 2, interaction analysis will be performed to define the mechanisms that regulate the specificity of the K63 ubiquitin pathway in response to oxidative stress (K99/R00). Further, it has been demonstrated that mammalian cells accumulate K63 ubiquitin in response to oxidative stress, but the evolutionary conservation of this redox pathway is completely unknown. In Aim 3, the redox K63 ubiquitin system will be taken to mammalian cells to investigate overall conservation by mapping this pathway to the stress response in neuronal cells (R00). The outcome of this project will unravel novel mechanisms to increase cell tolerance to stress depending on selective ubiquitination. My entire career focused on studying different regulatory aspects of the ubiquitin proteasome system in response to stress. During the K99 mentored phase of this award, I will obtain training in genomics and computational techniques that will enable the investigation of one more layer of cellular signaling mediated by ubiquitin. NYU offers an ideal combination of intellectual environment and multidisciplinary facilities for th development of the K99 phase of this project. My long-term career goal is to establish my independent research group that will combine systems-wide methodologies with molecular biology and genetic approaches to decode the ubiquitination signals in response to stress. This award offers a unique opportunity to achieve this goal by enabling precise training and career guidance from my mentors and committee for my transition to independence. Understanding the multiple ubiquitin roles in cellular response to stress and the specificity of each distinct pathwa will provide groundbreaking insights into innovative strategies for treatment and early diagnosis of many damage-related disorders.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract: Corneal surface injuries are painful and expose the eye to infections that can destroy vision. During our previous funding period, we characterized a model for the study of recurrent corneal erosions in mice and showed that subbasal nerves (SBNs) fail to reinnervate the cornea prior to erosion formation. In addition, we showed that we could induce SBN reinnervation by treating debridement wounded corneas with mitomycin C (MMC). The long-term goal of our research is to identify the factors that prevent the corneal epithelium from reforming an intact stable barrier after trauma. One factor is failed reinnervation of the SBNs. Our data lead us to propose two hypotheses. The first (Aim A) is that corneal epithelial basal cells adhere to, protect, organize, and maintain the subbasal nerves (SBNs) that originate from the trigeminal ganglion. The corneal epithelial cells protect individual SBNs by secreting a laminin-rich ECM to insulate them from one another, organize SBNs by enclosing clusters of several SBNs within infoldings of their basal and basolateral cell membranes forming epithelial cell:axon adhesions, and maintain optimal SBN function by removing damaged SBN stubs during homeostasis and after injury by phagocytosis. We will test this hypothesis by conducting experiments to answer the following questions: 1. Do corneal epithelial cells adhere to and provide support to SBNs using adhesion complexes and proteins similar to those used by non-myelinating Schwann cells? 2. Do corneal epithelial cells phagocytose axonal debris during homeostasis and in response to SBN damage? 3. Do corneal epithelial cells respond to SBN denervation by altering expression of genes that regulate axon regeneration in Schwann cells? A second hypothesis (Aim B) proposed is to resolve corneal pathology after trauma or disease, adhesion between corneal epithelial cells, SBNs, and the basement membrane must be restored to levels present prior to development of pathology. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary data showing that MMC reduces corneal epithelial cell migration in vitro and MMP9 expression in vivo. We will test this hypothesis by conducting experiments to answer the following questions: 1. Do corneal epithelial cells at the center of the wounded mouse cornea undergo senescence? 2. Can reinnervation be accelerated by treating crush (trephine only) wounded corneas with MMC? 3. Can erosions be eliminated after they form by treating mouse corneas with MMC? 4. Can MMC improve reinnervation of corneas in mice with dry eye disease? 5. Does a prior injury (conditioning lesion) improve reinnervation after crush or debridement wounds? Comparing reinnervation after different wound types allows us to differentiate between mechanisms that permit reinnervation after crush wounds from those that prevent reinnervation after debridement wounds and will give us insight into how MMC enhances reinnervation.',\n",
       " 'Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus and transmitted by sand flies, is considered by the WHO to be a neglected tropical disease, affecting about 1.5 million people per year. Approximately 70% of CL cases are reported from six countries, including Iran, where CL is endemic in 17 out of 30 provinces, with over 20,000 cases reported annually; the actual incidence has been estimated to be five times higher. There is no vaccine to prevent this disease. Efforts to control zoonotic CL (ZCL), including application of indoor residual insecticides, poisoning of rodent reservoirs, and use of insecticide-treated curtains and bednets (ITNs) have had limited success. In this 2-year project, we propose a novel field-based strategy aimed at prevention of Leishmania major transmission by the sand fly, P. papatasi, with a focus on the hyper-endemic region of Isfahan Province, Iran. Using the sand fly gut-associated bacterium, E. cloacae dissolvens, which has been isolated from biotic loci of ZCL in Isfahan, we propose to develop a paratransgenic model that may eventually be applied to field control. Initially, E. cloacae will be transformed to express the anti-leishmanial peptides, melittin and histone H2B, which act synergistically in vitro to kill L. major at concentrations as low as 1-3 ÂµM. Engineered E. cloacae will then be delivered to laboratory lines of P. papatasi using a soil-based strategy that targets larval stages; production of the recombinant peptides will be verified in adult flies. Challenge of the adult female flies with L. major is expected to result in parasite-refractory insects. Additional studies, to be conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), will simulate microbial conditions of rodent burrows where P. papatasi breed to establish the infectivity and persistence of the engineered bacteria in flies under conditions that mimic field settings. Final project deliverables will include engineered lines of E. cloacae dissolvens and a laboratory model of paratransgenic P. papatasi that can be further developed for field deployment in Iran and neighboring regions of the Middle East.

       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prevention of hospitalization has long been viewed as a major health benefit of the use of influenza vaccine. This was, in large part, the rationale for the initial vaccination programs targeting the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.  However, in the last decade, questions have been raised about the value of such programs. Modern study designs to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) have required laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, as well as documentation of vaccine receipt and the use of a test-negative design to control for differences in healthcare-seeking behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. There is a need for current estimates of VE in preventing influenza-associated hospitalization using these methods. We propose estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza hospitalization in two health systems in Michigan, where we have been conducting annual assessments of VE in various populations since 2008. We will conduct surveillance at two hospitals, and will enroll adult in-patients with acute respiratory infection. Vaccination status will be reported and documented, and considered with laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to estimate vaccine effectiveness for prevention of hospitalization. Analyses will use a test- negative design; those testing positive for influenza ar cases, those testing negative are controls. Modifiers and confounders of vaccine effectiveness such as age, health status, high-risk health conditions, functional status, frailty, education, tim from illness onset to specimen collection, calendar time, and propensity for vaccination will be assessed. In addition to our proposed influenza surveillance and VE assessment, we propose an estimation of the incidence of hospitalization in adults due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV and other respiratory viruses. This will allow for the evaluation of bias in influenza VE assessment due to interaction between influenza vaccination, infection, and non-influenza respiratory viruses, and will establish a platform for the future evaluation of RSV vaccines. We will accomplish these additional objectives by expanding our surveillance to months before and after the typical influenza season and evaluating specimens by molecular methods for RSV and other respiratory viruses.',\n",

       " 'PROJECT ABSTRACT In response to community requests, a Navajo Birth Cohort will be developed to study the prenatal, perinatal, and early postnatal health effects of environmental exposures to uranium and associated mining wastes on Navajo mothers and their offspring through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Co-operatively design and conduct a prospective epidemiologic birth cohort study of pregnancy outcomes and child development in relation to uranium waste exposures among Navajo mother-infant pairs.  1. Solicit community, Navajo and federal agency input, to inform the final study design to ensure it is  respectful of Navajo culture and includes appropriate measures to address community concerns  2. Enroll 1,650 pregnant women in early pregnancy (1st or early 2nd trimester, as feasible) and follow them  throughout pregnancy and childbirth (assumes a pregnancy loss rate of 10%)  3. Establish a birth cohort of 1,500 offspring of these women who will be assessed and followed for birth,  growth, and neurodevelopmental outcomes to 12 months of age (in the initial phase of follow-up)  4. Compare health endpoints (as finalized by the expanded Research Team) among mothers and their  children who are more and less likely to be exposed to uranium and associated metals. Aim 2: Characterize the cohort with respect to mobility, exposures, co-exposures, demographic and cultural characteristics that may influence outcomes  1. Measure/estimate human exposures to uranium and other toxicants, and identify exposure pathways  2. Use geospatial statistics to identify exposure hot spots as surrogates for exposure  3. Collect information on potential modifiers of susceptibility, such as diet and psychosocial stress Aim 3: With guidance from our expanded Community Liaison Group (CLG) and collaboration with community health workers, provide extensive outreach on the study goals and results, on prenatal care, available clinical services, and mitigation of any exposure-induced health effects on Navajo. Aim 4: Work with Navajo agency partners to develop their environmental health capacity and to develop a sustainability plan for continued follow-up of the cohort. This work will be accomplished through a cooperative agreement with ATSDR/CDC and involve agency scientists as well as communities in development and implementation of the final design. The Research Team combines scientific expertise in epidemiology, toxicology, mathematics and modeling, and environmental assessment with participation of Navajo culture and language experts, traditional medicinemen, and Navajo Nation agencies as well as clinical care providers to ensure not only respectful design and implementation, but effective translation of the results to policy, health care, and effective outreach and education for communities.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza viruses are constantly changing, requiring the reformulation of vaccines every year. Accurately estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza infection is critical in order to evaluate the protection provided by annua, nationwide vaccination programs. Our long-term goal is to discover more advanced strategies to measure vaccine effectiveness, to potentially reduce the overall burden of influenza infection. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines with the ACIP recommended universal immunization strategy in the Scott and White Memorial Hospital -Temple Population Research Area (SWH-TPRA) adult source population will be systematically investigated. The objective of the proposed work is to explore strategies for measuring vaccine effectiveness against lab-confirmed influenza (VE-LCI) in adult inpatients, including the elderly, who have the highest hospitalization  rates. This includes the identification, implementation and evaluation of innovative, feasible, and  sustainable strategies for measuring VE-LCI in persons aged 18 years or older in acute inpatient care settings. The central hypothesis is that timely and efficient measurement of VE- LCI in adult inpatients is feasible and sustainable in the U.S. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify innovative, feasible, and sustainable strategies to measure VE-LCI in a timely and efficient manner for persons ? 18 years admitted with an acute respiratory illness (ARI) in acute inpatient care settings, 2) Implement the above strategies to measure VE-LCI for adult inpatients with ARI, and 3) Evaluate the above strategies to measure VE-LCI for adult inpatients with ARI. To achieve these goals, VE-LCI will be determined in adults admitted to SWMH with ARI who test positive for influenza A and/or B by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The odds of being vaccinated against influenza for PCR-confirmed cases will be compared to age-matched PCR-negative controls, after adjusting for confounders. During 2015- 2016 through 2019-2020, 300 patients and 800 adults admitted to SWMH with an ARI will be eligible to participate in the BSWH CDC VE-LCI adult inpatient study, respectively. Using a test-negative study design, VE-LCI for adult inpatients with ARI will be measured. Influenza immunization rates will be calculated for the RT-PCR confirmed cases and test negative controls, adjusting VE-LCI for confounders. The approach is innovative because effective measures of the public health impact of increasing influenza immunization on burden of illness will be defined. The proposed research is significant, because it will support improved understanding of timely and efficient measures of VE-LCI, which in turn will support the goal of reducing influenza-associated health burdens.',\n",
       " 'Background: VA performance monitoring makes extensive use of diagnosis-based quality measures that track delivery of care only among patients who have qualifying ICD-9 diagnosis codes. Diagnosis-based measures can be calculated using existing VA data, allowing for low-cost, near real-time performance monitoring. However, diagnosis-based measures can have critical validity problems if the targeted condition is under- or over-diagnosed to differing degrees across facilities. When variation is diagnosing and coding occurs, facility rankings on measured performance can be misleading: High performing facilities can score poorly, low performing facilities can score well, and facilities with the same real performance can fall at opposite ends of the facility rank distribution. Use of diagnosis-based process measures can therefore undermine one of the primary purposes of quality measurement: The comparison of facilities and systems. In addition, diagnosis- based measures cannot be used to detect gaps in access to care for patients who have a targeted condition but no qualifying diagnosis code. Finally, when diagnosis rates vary across patient subgroups, diagnosis-based measures cannot be used to detect and act on healthcare disparities. Problems with diagnosis-based measures could be remedied if true prevalence data were available: Comparisons of performance based on diagnosis- versus prevalence-based measures would detect facilities with anomalous diagnosis rates and distinguish variation in true performance from variation in case-finding. However, for many conditions, the electronic health record (EHR) does not contain data on true prevalence. Objectives: The goal of the proposed project is to develop a general method for improving diagnosis-based measures when valid prevalence data are not readily available. We propose to build a model for predicting prevalence using multiple sources of existing data and to validate it through a one-time collection of gold standard outcome data (survey-based SUD prevalence). Leveraging existing data with targeted collection of model development and validation data is a cost-effective strategy to improve diagnosis-based measures without requiring ongoing, expensive disease surveillance. Focusing on substance use disorder (SUD) care as an example, the objectives of this study are to: (a) assess the degree of SUD under- or over-diagnosis by comparing the proportion of patients with coded SUD diagnoses in the VA administrative data to SUD prevalence estimates obtained using a validated measure in a patient survey conducted at 30 VA healthcare systems; (b) refine and validate a model for predicting SUD prevalence among VA patients using multiple existing data sources; and (c) assess disparities in SUD diagnosis by comparing diagnosis rates to survey- based SUD prevalence estimates across patient age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups. Methods: We will collect data on DSM-IV and DSM-5-concordant SUD among VA patients using a validated instrument. We will conduct telephone interviews with patients at 30 VA healthcare systems selected based on geographic region and expected differences between observed SUD diagnosis and true SUD prevalence. We will compare observed diagnosis rates to survey-based prevalence estimates. We will refine a prototype SUD prediction model using as inputs population SUD surveillance data for Veterans from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health, EHR data from VA Corporate Data Warehouse, and organizational survey data from the VA Drug and Alcohol Program Survey. The model will be developed and validated using survey-based SUD prevalence as the outcome. We will fit the model using traditional methods and more modern machine learning algorithms and will select a final model based on established criteria for predictive validity. We will compute facility performance rankings using diagnosis rates versus predicted prevalence to assess the extent to which variation in performance may reflect variation in diagnosis or coding. Finally, we will assess possible disparities in diagnosing by comparing the gap between diagnosis and estimated prevalence across patient groups.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia and stroke are substantially higher among blacks aged 45+, and among residents of the southeastern region of the US. The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study is national, longitudinal cohort study of ~ 30,000 blacks and whites designed to advance the understanding of the epidemiology of cognitive decline and stroke, and the contributors to racial and geographic disparities in these outcomes. The current application has three aims:  1. Identify social, cardiovascular, and environmental mechanisms of racial and geographic  disparities in incident vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).  With assessment in mid-life and over a decade of longitudinal cognitive data, REGARDS is  uniquely positioned to identify vascular, social, and behavioral mechanisms underlying  disparities in VCID, and modifiable pathways on which interventions may narrow disparities  in VCID. After completion of a nested calibration/confirmation study to develop an algorithm  for the classification of MCI and dementia, we will characterize racial and geographic  disparities in VCID and determine if interventions on mediators would diminish or eliminate disparities.  2. Answer as-yet-unanswered questions in stroke and cerebrovascular disease epidemiology.  By continuing the successful approaches for stroke surveillance among 17000 active cohort  members, the study will assess the association of risk factor changes and novel biomarkers  quantified with the completion of the second in-person exam with stroke risk and disparities  in stroke risk. In addition, with the aging of the cohort, this aim will provide greatly needed  information on stroke epidemiology in the elderly.  3. Utilize incident risk factor data and biospecimens to identify pathways for development of  incident hypertension and diabetes, with the goal of understanding the impact on incident  VCID and stroke. We have documented that ?30% of the racial disparity in stroke risk is  attributable to racial disparities in prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, and the study  will investigate the biomarker pathways contributing to the higher incidence of hypertension  and diabetes in blacks.  Each proposed aim addresses a topic of profound public health impact, and REGARDS  progress to date uniquely positions the study to address these aims using proven approaches  in an efficient manner.',\n",
       " 'During infection the adaptive immune response has two primary goals, a short-term goal to eradicate the present infection and a long-term goal to establish immunological memory and protect against re- infection. These two goals are fulfilled by generating a heterogeneous pool of activated T and B cells that contain both short-term effector cells and memory cell precursors that persist long-term to seed a  + pool of memory cells and provide exceptional protection agianst reinfection. Because cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are critical for clearing many types of intracellular infections and tumors, the development of many vaccines (e.g., HIV and plasmodium) are aimed at generating protective memory CD8 T cells. The question of how different types of memory T cells form during infection and vaccination and what genetic pathways and epigenetic changes control this process remains paramount. This past decade represents the dawn of a molecular understanding of memory CD8 T cell development, which largely through the use of well-characterized infection models in mice has discovered critical transcription factors and cytokine signaling pathways involved in this process. This work has delivered unprecedented insight into the genetic pathways that control memory T cell differentiation, but we are still in a discovery phase as only a handful of factors (cytokines and transcription factors (TFs)) have been identified that modulate effector and memory CD8 T cell differentiation in vivo during infection. Moreover, it is unclear how such factors cooperate or combat one another activities or to regulate the epigenetic states that specify effector and memory T cell fates. Elucidating these genetic and epigenetic networks is necessary to understand how the effector and memory T cell differentiation is controlled. It is likely that we will only really start to understand how T cell fates are specified and how the inherent heterogeneity and plasticity observed in T cells is controlled through studying the epigenome of T cells. Thus, the overarching goals of this MERIT extension are to elucidate genetic and epigenetic control of effector and memory CD8 T cell differentiation, plasticity and heterogeneity. This proposal will not only provide new insight on novel genetic regulators of effector and memory T cell development, but it will also reveal how effector T cell plasticity or commitment to terminal fates is regulated at the genomic level.

       " \"Clinically actionable neoantigens in non-small cell lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among US Veterans as well as the world's leading cause of cancer death. Environmental exposure and tobacco use among Veterans operate together to increase risk. Unleashing the immune response against pulmonary premalignancy could transform therapy and outcomes. Here, we propose to lay the ground work for lung ?cancer interception,? a strategy that seeks to block the progression of premalignancy to invasive cancer. In our preliminary studies we have begun to evaluate the mutational landscape of pulmonary premalignancy and the associated premalignant microenvironment by whole exome DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Remarkably, we find frequent immune-effector cell infiltration as well as evidence of immune suppression in pulmonary premalignancy. These findings lead us to hypothesize that premalignant-associated neoantigens (PANs) are recognized and elicit immune responses at the earliest points of lung adenocarcinoma development. This research will identify neoepitopes that can be targeted before the development of invasive lung cancer, thus shifting the approach to disease interception through immunoprevention and treatment of the very earliest phase of the disease. The specific aims are: 1) To utilize whole exome DNA sequencing (WES) to determine computationally-defined neoantigens in matched sets of primary tumor, premalignant lesions and adjacent histologically normal lung tissues. 2) To identify functionally relevant neoepitopes associated with tumor progression: Two sources of T cells, one from TIL, the other from peripheral blood PD1+ T cells, will be used to identify neoepitope-specific CD8+ T cells. To improve screening efficiency, we will focus on neoantigens shared between pre-malignant lesions and primary tumors that are potentially progression-relevant. Functional assays will be performed to verify the identified neoepitopes. This will lead to patient-tailored neoepitopes for future vaccine or adoptive cell therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 3) To relate the immune contexture to WES-defined mutational landscapes in premalignancy and the associated tumor we will: 3A) Perform quantitative multiplexed immunofluorescent staining of the same specimens utilized in the first two aims to assess the regulators of cell- mediated immunity and to relate this to the mutational landscapes and neoepitopes of the premalignant lesions and tumors, 3B) Evaluate gene expression utilizing a Nanostring panel of 770 immune-related genes and, 3C) Integrate findings from WES, gene expression and tissue immunostaining to define the landscape of adenocarcinoma pulmonary premalignancy. This research seeks to transform the approach to both the prevention and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma by discovery of functional neoepitopes that can be utilized in the development of vaccines and adoptive therapies to intercept disease at the earliest phases. With the advent of screening, many patients are presenting with imaging studies consistent with focal or multifocal premalignancy. As we increase our knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis and natural history of the disease, discovery of critical neoepitopes will facilitate vaccine development for those at the highest risk for progression to invasive lung cancer.\",\n",
       " 'The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate a new multiple sclerosis (MS) spasticity education and stretching program called MS Spasticity: Take Control (STC) in a fully powered, randomized, controlled trial for benefit after one month (short-term) of home stretching practice and sustainability of benefit after six months (medium- term) of home stretching practice. Important first steps are complete: 1) the Spasticity and MS Clinical Practice Guideline has been developed; 2) the proposed PI has created a self-management program, STC, for MS- related spasticity that includes two DVDs MS Spasticity: Take Control (with educational information) and MS Spasticity: Take Control of Lower Extremity Stretching (with standardized stretching instructions) and companion reference manuals, and 3) the program has been tested in 40 subjects with MS and spasticity. STC demonstrated initial efficacy as well as feasibility, acceptance and rapid enrollment with satisfaction reported by participants. In the present study, eligible subjects in northwest Oregon and southwest Washington will be randomly assigned 1:1 to STC or usual care (UC). STC subjects will attend two in-person group sessions with the PI and the study coordinator to view and discuss information presented in both DVDs at the first session and practice all the stretches in the second session with the goal of finding a set of exercises for daily stretching for their home practice for the following six months. UC subjects will not attend classes but, instead, will be given a copy of the NMSS stretching brochure to use in their home practice without instruction or group support. The primary endpoint outcome measures will be collected after the classes for the STC group and one month of home practice. The same outcome measures will be collected after six months of home practice for the secondary endpoint when subjects will exit the study. Both groups will start their home practice within two weeks of each other, within two months of baseline data collection and be provided the same diaries to track their home stretching and other exercise participation. The primary outcome measure is the MS Spasticity Scale 88. Secondary outcome measures are the Numeric Rating Scale for Spasticity and the National Institute of Health (NIH) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) collection that specifically assess fatigue, sleep, physical function, self-efficacy, social participation, social satisfaction and perception of global health from their online collection of patient-reported health status inventories and outcome measures with the novel capability of administering computerized adaptive tests (CATs). CATs adapt to the individual by selecting subsequent questions based on participants? prior responses reducing the length of the tests and therefore each test takes approximately one to two minutes to complete. The NIH recommends using these outcome measures to accelerate discovery by making studies more easily comparable. A new standardized program for MS spasticity including lower extremity stretching now exists, has feasibility and initial efficacy and needs testing in a fully powered trial for short and medium term benefit. If effective, such treatment would be expected to impact the day-to-day function, enhance participation with families and the community and improve health related quality of life for all people with MS and spasticity. A web-based intervention could be created from the current program for dissemination throughout the VA and, if effective, could be adapted to other neurological conditions with spasticity such as spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury and stroke and also easily disseminated worldwide. We anticipate 48 months to recruit subjects in Oregon and Washington, deliver the intervention, follow them for 6 months, report the results and submit for a future trial of STC or development of a web-based version of the program.',\n",

Based on the work from a P20 planning grant, our program will consist of the following: (1) identify biomarkers of epileptogenesis in our animal model and in patients, (2) Develop and utilize a standardized platform for preclinical trials of potential antiepileptogenic (AEG) drugs, (3) Identify 1 or more lead antiepileptogenic drugs for a future interventional clinical trial, (4) Establish a network of advanced TBI centers capable of carrying out future clinical trials featuring our lead antiepileptogenic drugs used in the context of a personalized, medicine-based approach utilizing our panel of biomarkers, and (5) Develop and incorporate a public engagement program involving the mutual education and collaboration of consumers, consumer organizations and professionals to design and execute future large-scale interventional clinical trials of antiepileptogenic therapies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The low number of college graduates from underrepresented (UR) groups in Arkansas, together with the low national number of UR students who graduate in the biological sciences and public health, result in a small pool of students entering the field of biomedical research. To address this shortfall, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) created the UAMS Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) Program in 2009 to provide UR students pursuing biomedical doctoral degrees with 2 years of salary/tuition, mentoring, and other student development activities with funds from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS). The UAMS IMSD Program has had a significant impact on UR enrollment in the doctoral programs. In 2008, the average UAMS enrollment of UR students in biomedical sciences doctoral programs was 6.1%, which trailed the then national average of UR student enrollment in all biological sciences of 8.2%. Currently, the average UR member enrollment rate in UAMS doctoral programs is 15.3%, 4.6 percentage points above the national average of 10.7% UR graduate students. The overall goal of the UAMS IMSD program is to improve upon the success UAMS has had in recruiting and retaining UR students during the first 4 years of the IMSD Program. We will do this by implementing our specific measureable objectives that aim to increase UR doctoral student enrollment in the biomedical sciences to 20% and boost the number of UR students graduating with biomedical science doctorate degrees to 20% of total UAMS biomedical doctoral graduates by 2019. These objectives align with the NIH-MBRS goals of increasing the number of UR students graduating from doctoral programs in the biomedical sciences at institutions with a research intensive environment and reducing the PhD completion gap between UR and non-UR students in the biomedical sciences. Our first Aim is to increase the number of UR student applicants to doctoral programs in the biomedical sciences by 50% by 2018. We will accomplish this by increasing our recruiting activities and enlarging our capacity to measure the results of these activities and subsequently revise our strategies. Aim 2 is to retain and graduate 90% of the students in the IMSD Program. We will build on our past retention success by enhancing our PhD Summer Transition Program for matriculated students, expanding student development activities, enhancing retention activities, and advancing our mentoring plan. The final Aim is to evaluate the program and determine which factors contributed to successes and which areas need improvement, and disseminate the results. Program strategies and outcomes will be disseminated to the UAMS campus and other schools through newsletters, presentations, and publications. The initiatives proposed here can contribute to the global recruitment, retention, and graduation of all UR students at UAMS and provide lessons learned to other institutions, which will ultimately increase the numbers of UR faculty and investigators in the biomedical science workforce serving Arkansas and the nation.',\n",
       " \"ABSTRACT  Microglia,-the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), are thought to be important contributors to CNS health and' disease but their exact functional roles are still mysterious. Direct CNS damage, as well as peripheral injuries and addictive drug exposure, all induce microglial activation. A longstanding limitation in investigating microglia is the lack of good tools to distinguish and manipulate microglia specifically without altering macrophages or other immune cell types. In this proposal we will use new tools that our lab has recently generated to specifically identify and genetically manipulate microglia in order to investigate their function. First we will use these tools to develop the first in vitro culture system in which purified microglial cells can be cultured in defined serum-free medium with high survival in a non- activated state. This will enable us to directly test their specific functions for the first time including their ability to promote neuronal and glial survival, or to regulate synapse formation and function, as well as to elucidate the specific signals that induce their activation and to assess how their normal functions are altered when microglia become activated. Second, we will perform metabolomics analysis to investigate nature of the chemical signaling molecules that resting and activated microglial cells secrete. Third, we will use the new genetic tools we have developed to ablate microglia to elucidate their role in the establishment and maintenance of reactive gliosis and neuropathic pain. Lastly vye will identify the specific molecular mechanisms through which microglial cells influence these processes. Presently, drugs available for treatment of pain, such as opiates, suffer from undesired side effects and the development of tolerance. The purpose of the proposed research is to determine the molecular events that produce glial cell mediated neural circuitry modifications, opioid tolerance and addiction, as well as neuropathic pain in order to identify novel therapeutic targets. The findings will lay the groundwork for future research in understanding the role of microglia in drug- induced plasticity in reward-related neuronal circuits.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract ? Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract The past decade has seen outstanding advances in the genetics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however only a moderate number of the hundreds of genes and genomic regions thought to be involved in ASD have been identified. Advances have come largely from the study of rare genetic variants, especially de novo varia- tion, including single nucleotide variation (SNV), insertion/deletions (indels), copy number variation (CNV), and larger chromosomal imbalances. A portion of the progress for ASD has come through the efforts of the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC), which represents a coordinated effort by more than 40 independent groups to rapidly identify ASD risk genes. Here we propose to continue the work of the ASC, largely by continued pro- duction and analysis of sequence data from ASD subjects and their families. The ASC benefits from substan- tial leveraging of resources, including the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) centered at the Broad Insti- tute (BI) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) of ASC samples, supported by an NHGRI Center Grant to BI, to make this renewal as low cost as possible. We also plan new avenues of research, such as integrating whole genome sequence (WGS) data and building on ideas that have emerged from the study of common variants to understand the interplay of common and rare variants to impact risk. Through this new research we will accel- erate our overall objective, which is the identification of ASD genes, thereby facilitating our long-term goal of building the foundation from which therapeutic targets for ASD emerge. Our rationale is that the identification of genes conferring significant risk to ASD and associated neurodevelopmental disorders can form the basis of studies to understand pathogenesis, as well as the basis for novel therapies. Moreover, such variants have direct implications for patients and their families in terms of etiological diagnosis, genetic counseling and pa- tient care. Our central hypothesis ? formulated based on results over the past decade ? is that rare and com- mon variation contributes additively to risk for ASD, but only certain rare variants confer substantial risk. The objectives will be accomplished with the following Specific Aims: 1) Produce and/or analyze WES of 30,000 new ASD subjects, parents and other controls, for a total of more than 50,000 samples; 2) Develop and apply approaches to find ?hidden? risk variants, and, 3) Use results from common and rare variant studies to describe the interplay of such variation in ASD risk. This contribution is significant because it represents the first step in research to understand pathogenesis of ASD and to the development of pharmacological strategies for treat- ment of core symptoms of ASD and etiologically related neurodevelopmental disorders. The research pro- posed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses groundbreaking and novel statistical methods for identify- ing risk variants and for integrating rare and common variation. This is a new and substantively different ap- proach to gene discovery in ASD that departs significantly from the status quo and provides the means to achieve these important goals.',\n",
       " \"Abstract Title: Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Oseteopontin Isoform-Induced Neovascularization  Coronary artery and peripheral arterial disease (CAD and PAD) remain leading causes of mortality in the United States and both result in ischemia downstream of vessel occlusion sites. The body's endogenous response to ischemia is to increase neovascularization to recover blood flow through the formation of a functional collateral vessel network. One of the mechanisms by which collateral vessel formation occurs is through arteriogenesis, which is defined as the enlargement of existing capillaries and arterioles into larger conductance arteries downstream of vessel occlusion sites. Arteriogenesis requires cytokine signaling, macrophage recruitment, matrix remodeling, and Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration. We previously demonstrated that osteopontin (OPN), a secreted, multifunctional, glycol-phospho-protein that can act as a cytokine, is highly upregulated in response to ischemia and is a critical mediator of collateral vessel formation. OPN primarily signals through CD44 and integrin receptors and has been linked to cell survival, proliferation, migration and adhesion, all of which are required for collateral formation. Unlike rodents, humans expresses three OPN isoforms as a result of alternative splicing: OPNa, OPNb, and OPNc. Our preliminary data demonstrate that these human OPN (hOPN) isoforms have divergent effects on functional collateral formation in vivo and cell migration in vitro, despite intact integrin and CD44 receptor binding domains in all 3 isoforms. However, how OPN isoforms differentially promote collateral vessel formation and cell migration and what different OPN isoforms are expressed in human ischemic tissues remain undefined. OPN is subject to extensive post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation and glycosylation, which could have significant implications for its intrinsic biological function. Therefore, we hypothesize that differences in phosphorylation of OPN isoforms may significantly alter OPN isoform receptor binding to CD44 and/or ?v integrins and, thus, contribute to differences in OPN isoform intrinsic biological function in cell migration and neovascularization. This project will determine determine the OPN phosphorylations necessary for OPN isoform-specific receptor binding to promote OPN-induced VSMC migration and collateral formation. Understanding the mechanisms by which human OPN isoforms differentially promote collateral formation and cell migration could ultimately provide mechanic insights into the development of novel therapeutic targets to treat patients with obstructive arterial disease, enhancing blood flow and retain tissue function.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Concussion, a traumatically induced brain injury, is described by the Centers for Disease Control as a serious public health problem. Currently, management protocols are based on consensus and expert opinion, rather than high quality evidence, potentially resulting in difficulty in diagnosis and identification of physiologic recovery. The use of objective and quantitative measurements to better understand the etiology of concussion symptoms and the efficacy of intervention protocols may allow investigators to improve post-concussion care. Symptoms such as headache, dizziness, or cognitive difficulties commonly occur after concussion and likely relate to cerebrovascular dysfunction. Cerebral autoregulation, cerebral reactivity, and neurovascular coupling represent three areas of cerebrovascular function that are impaired after a concussion and relate to the presence of specific concussion symptoms. Cerebrovascular functioning may also relate to higher order cognitive functions, such as executive functioning. Combined gait and cognitive tests (dual-tasks) can probe executive function abilities, and can also objectively reveal post-concussion deficits. Thus, improved understanding of how concussion symptomology, cerebrovascular function, and gait function relate to one another will help in the objective monitoring of recovery. Additionally, rehabilitative strategies in concussion care have remained relatively ineffective, particularly when initiated soon after injury. Sub-maximal aerobic exercise is one potential rehabilitative strategy to improve cerebrovascular function, locomotor performance, and executive functioning, in addition to alleviating post-concussion symptoms. Therefore, we seek to examine 52 symptomatic adolescents within two weeks of a concussion on measures of symptom severity, cerebrovascular function, gait, and executive functioning. Participants will be pseudo-randomized into an 8- week sub-maximal aerobic exercise intervention or usual care, and physical activity intensity and duration will be objectively monitored with a heart rate monitor. Accordingly, we will 1) determine the relationship between symptoms, cerebrovascular function, gait, and executive function soon after a concussion, and 2) investigate the effect of an aerobic exercise intervention protocol on concussion recovery. We believe this represents an important line of research as few studies have used quantitative and objective measures to examine the efficacy of concussion treatments, and our study design will allow us to observe how post-concussion aerobic exercise initiated soon after injury affects recovery trajectories. Thus, improved understanding of the role of physical activity after concussion may eventually pave the way to develop better therapeutic interventions, and eliminate ?one therapy for all? treatments.',\n",
       " \"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This NIH S10 High-End Instrumentation grant application requests funds to purchase a SIEMENS Next Generation PET/CT scanner. The SIEMENS Next Generation PET/CT scanner which we intend to purchase with this grant will be the only commercially available long-bore 8-ring PET/CT system with SiPM detectors; this scanner will replace our much-used current research PET/CT scanner, a 10-year-old SIEMENS Biograph 40 PET/CT scanner housed in our 8,900 square foot Washington University Center for Clinical Imaging Research (CCIR). Washington University has a long history of expertise in PET imaging. Creating the foundation for expertise in PET, Washington University's research in imaging sciences dates back to physicist and Nobel laureate Arthur Holly Compton's discovery of gamma ray/electron scattering interactions in 1922. This ground-breaking research continued with the installation of a cyclotron in 1938, the first in the world for biomedical applications. In the early 1960s another biomedical cyclotron was used to produce short-lived isotopes of oxygen (15O) and carbon (11C). This dovetailed with the development of the first human/clinical use positron emission tomography (PET) scanner by Michel Ter-Pogossian and team at WU in the mid 1970s. It is especially important for universities performing basic high-impact PET research and first-in-human radiotracer studies, and participating in large-scale single center and multicenter PET/CT trials to have the most advanced PET/CT equipment available. Currently, Washington University (WU), despite 69 PET/CT basic science studies and clinical research trials, multiple first-in-human studies and 4 functional cyclotrons, does not have a research PET/CT system with TOF and optimal count rate performance required for the better image quality and sensitivity needed to detect subtle findings and improve quantitative accuracy in small lesion tracer uptake measurements. The Next Generation PET/CT scanner will be installed in the CCIR, a Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University clinical research NIH recharge facility locate centrally in the main teaching hospital of the Washington University School of Medicine. The CCIR provides a substantive support system for its users, 70% of whom are non-radiologists. The director of this facility, Pamela Woodard, M.D., is the PI of this grant. As Sr. Vice Chair for Radiology Research Facilities, she also oversees other facilities (with their own directors) supportive of this instrument, including the Cyclotron Facility.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract In addition to impairment of motor, autonomic and sensory function, severe pain is highly prevalent in patients after spinal cord injury. This project aims to better understand the cortical mechanisms and changes underlying the development of central neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury challenging the assumption that hyperexcitability of neuronal circuits can only be modified by directly blocking excitation or increasing the activity of inhibitory circuits. Our previous work has characterized the onset and maintenance of chronic central neuropathic pain in a mouse model of contusion injury. Our preliminary data also show that sensory cortical activity is initially decreased after a transient spinal cord ischemia followed by hyperactivity paralleling the onset of pain behavior. This hyperactivity and the associated pain behavior can be diminished by optogenetic stimulation of somatosensory cortex early after injury. In addition, we have shown that treadmill training can prevent the development and partially reverse pain-associated behavior in mice. We now aim to characterize in detail changes in somatosensory cortical activity after traumatic spinal cord injury in mice using patch- clamping and in vivo calcium imaging in transgenic mice. We also aim to determine whether modulating cortical activity by somatosensory training can modulate cortical hyperactivity after spinal cord injury and thereby ameliorate neuropathic pain. Thereby, we will advance our understanding of the development and maintenance of chronic pain after spinal cord injury, identify cortical mechanisms underlying the development of chronic pain that can be translated into novel pharmacological and rehabilitative treatments that interfere with homeostatic plasticity for a comprehensive pain management.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal responds to PA-15-324, End-of-Life (EOL) and Palliative Needs of Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) with Serious Illnesses, a research priority for the National Institutes of Health. AYAs with cancer account for 70,000 new cancer diagnoses in the United States per year, and cancer is their leading disease-related cause of death. However, the quality of EOL care these patients receive has not been systematically defined or measured. In addition, existing measures of EOL care quality were designed for older adults and inadequately capture AYA patient values; a set of measures to characterize high quality EOL care for AYAs does not exist. The overarching goal of this application is to answer the questions: What is the quality of EOL care for AYAs with cancer? What is a patient-centered definition of high quality EOL care for AYAs facing terminal illness? This application will leverage unique data available through Dana- Farber Cancer Institute and the Cancer Research Network to examine care among 2500 AYA cancer patients who died from 2003-2017 between the ages of 12 and 39, and expand on existing measures by developing a novel set of EOL care quality indicators that reflect the needs of AYAs. The proposed study will: Aim 1: Examine EOL care experiences among AYA patients with cancer. We will (a) establish a cohort of 2500 AYA cancer patients who died between 2003 and 2017 after receiving care at one of our three sites; (b) use electronic health records and in-depth medical record review to evaluate EOL care quality; and (c) evaluate sources of variation in EOL care, including differences between patients aged 12-24 years and those aged 25-39 years at death. Aim 2: Develop a novel set of EOL care quality indicators that reflects the needs of the AYA population. The investigators will (a) conduct in-depth interviews with AYA patients and family members, oncology and hospice nurses, and physicians in oncology and hospice/palliative medicine, to develop a set of candidate quality attributes applicable to AYA patients; (b) use a modified Delphi process among stakeholders to hone in on relevant and priority domains for AYA patients aged 12-24 and 25-39 years; and (c) use results to specify a novel set of AYA EOL care quality indicators using administrative, medical record, and interview data. Aim 3: Evaluate the quality of EOL care using newly developed indicators among recent AYA decedents. Investigators will (a) survey surviving family caregivers and perform additional focused medical record review for 300 recent AYA decedents from the parent cohort to evaluate EOL care quality according to newly developed quality indicators; and (b) compare findings from novel versus established indicators. This study will allow an understanding of the current state of EOL care quality among AYA patients and develop a set of quality indicators that capture AYA patient values for care. This work will enable valid assessment of care quality and rigorous evaluation of interventions to improve AYA EOL care delivery.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Ovarian cancer (OC) is deadly and incurable for patients that recur after primary cancer is treated with surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, OC has a high rate of disease recurrence (70-80%) and most recurrent tumors are chemoresistant. Currently, therapeutic options are quite limited for these patients, and thus unlike with other cancers, the mortality in OC has not improved in decades. This dreadful situation highlights a drastic need for new and improved therapeutics to eliminate and treat recurrent and chemoresistant disease. In this context our studies identified increased Hedgehog (Hh)/GLI signaling in chemoresistant OC cells and tumors, and GLI1 expression significantly correlated with upregulated FA-BRCA and homologous recombination (HR) genes, cancer stem cell signaling and poor prognosis of OC patients. Our preliminary data demonstrate that GLI1 regulates expression of DNA repair genes BRCA1, FANCD2 and RAD51 in OC cells and tumors and its inhibition induces a state known as ?BRCAness?, which is characterized by inefficient repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB). Additionally, Hh/GLI1 inhibition or downregulation decreased cell survival and ability to form tumor spheroids (stem cell characteristic), and enabled synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors. In this proposal we aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Hh/GLI1 regulates FA-BRCA and HR genes that promote oncogenic replication (Aim 1), and determine the efficacy of Hh/GLI1 inhibitors in both BRCA-proficient and deficient OC cells in cell line and ovarian cancer orthotopic mouse models (Aim 2). Towards the goal of identifying effective therapeutic combinations that work synergistically and induce synthetic lethality, we will evaluate effective therapeutic combinations involving Hh/GLI1 and PARP inhibitors. The most efficient drug combinations will be examined in a mouse orthotopic and patient derived xenograft models of OC to evaluate their efficacy in combatting acquired chemoresistance and OC disease progression (Aim 3). Chemotherapeutic drugs examined in this proposal are FDA approved or currently undergoing clinical and preclinical evaluation (ex. vismodegib, sonidegib, GANT61, olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib); thus, the effective drug combinations discovered can quickly be transitioned into clinical trials and developed into treatments for OC patients.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract We intend to leverage a unique model system developed in our laboratories to reproduce diverse ecosystems representing the human distal colon (DC) and use them to identify the role of the vast communities of viruses that inhabit the DC. Many of these viruses are bacteriophages that are postulated to play major roles in altering human bacterial communities, but until now there has been no available technology to assess their roles. Because bacteriophages kill their hosts or provide them with potentially beneficial gene functions, we hypothesize that they have a significant capacity to shape the human microbiome and potentially play a role in the maintenance of health and the development of disease. Our laboratories have pioneered technologies to characterize these viral communities, and have shown that viral communities are highly personal, persistent, host sex consistent, harbor genes involved in antibiotic resistance, and are readily transmissible between close contacts. We believe that the unique model ecosystems we have developed will allow us to reproduce the diverse and complex microbial ecology of the DC, and will play a critical role in helping to decipher the role of the viral communities that inhabit the human DC. We now know that bacteria in the gut play significant roles in human health and disease, yet the forces that shape the gut microbiome are still being uncovered. Much of the diversity in the DC can be grouped into distinct enterotypes; these groups are driven by the relative abundances of microbes such as Bacteroides in different individuals. Our model system simulates the diverse DC microbiota, and is the first model capable of recapitulating the enormous microbial diversity of the DC. The system incorporates bile salts, mucins, and starches to create an environment suitable for DC bacteria. Another major benefit of this system is its accurate reproduction of viral communities from the DC. We hypothesize that the use of this model system will allow us to directly test the impacts of virus-mediated perturbations on different enterotypes. The proposed studies will help decipher the impacts of viruses on the diversity and taxonomy of gut enterotypes, and determine whether virus-mediated perturbations result in enterotype switching. Our aims are as follows: Aim 1) Establish model systems representing different distal colon enterotypes, and Aim 2) Characterize the responses of cultured communities to virus-mediated perturbations. We believe that through the development of our model DC ecosystem, we can address fundamental questions about the roles of viruses in the human microbiome, including: 1) how do viral communities impact our DC microbiomes?, 2) are viruses important determinants of DC microbial ecology?, and 3) how do viruses from individuals with different enterotypes affect one another? We believe the proposed research is a critical first step in understanding how viral communities may be used to manipulate the human microbiome.',\n",
       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elderly suffer the majority of influenza hospitalizations and deaths and are a priority for determining influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). The Univ. of Pittsburgh and UPMC Health System (UPMC) are located in Allegheny County (AC), in which influenza is reportable & which has one of the 5 oldest populations in the U.S. We propose a test-negative case-control study of influenza VE in 2 UPMC hospitals to determine VE against hospitalizations of adults. UPMC has been on the US News honor roll for over a decade, including most wired and has a strong research tradition. The influenza season will be determined from syndromic surveillance from multiple hospital EDs, the Health Dept. (ACHD), & from lab data from >14,000 respiratory viral panels (RVP) done annually at UPMC. Theradoc informatics will identify adult inpatients who have had an RVP conducted. Enrollees' survey data will be directly entered into NIH's REDCap. Frailty can be assessed by survey and/or electronic medical record (EMR) data (e.g., Charleson Co-morbidity Index) to assess confounders and effect modifiers. Our Data Center manages REDCap data, EMR data from hospitalizations, & immunization data for uploading to CDC. Population-based incidence of influenza hospitalizations will be determined from ACHD and UPMC St. Margaret hospitalization data and by agent-based modeling at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Our team is a strong candidate for this project because: 1) UPMC is the dominant regional health system with a strong bond rating; 2) infection control personnel recommend RVPs to establish diagnoses, and our team's leadership responsibilities at the hospitals can further influence the use of RVPs; 3) we have published data showing excellent concordance between UPMC's GenMark RVP and the CDC's PCR for detecting influenza; 4) research shows better protection in the elderly from high-dose influenza (HD) vaccine; UPMC has recommended and promoted HD vaccine in large quantities, although regular vaccine is available, allowing for vaccine type comparisons; 5) UPMC's EMR links inpatient and outpatient vaccination records, and interfaces with the state immunization registry; 6) it includes diverse, well-published investigators who have worked together previously.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian female reproductive tract, including the oviducts, uterus, and vagina, is essential for the generation of progeny and a frequent site of human disease, including infertility and cancer. The female reproductive tract is derived from the M?llerian ducts of the fetus, a pair of epithelial tubes with a surrounding mesenchyme. In mammals, two pairs of genital ducts form within the mesonephroi associated with the fetal gonads regardless of sex genotype. Initially, the Wolffian ducts form that subsequently give rise to the vas deferentia, epididymides, and seminal vesicles in males. The Wolffian ducts then guide the formation of the M?llerian ducts. The cell behaviors that regulate the elongation of the M?llerian duct are poorly understood. We will use fluorescent, time-lapse imaging of the mesonephros to determine the cell behaviors and mechanisms that lead to M?llerian duct elongation. We have shown that deletion of Lhx1, that encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, in the M?llerian duct leads to ductal loss and subsequently uterine aplasia. In the absence of the M?llerian duct the epithelial compartment, the stroma and inner myometrial layer of the uterus does not differentiate. However, the outer myometrium does form. These results highlight the intrinsic and extrinsic roles of the M?llerian duct for female reproductive tract differentiation. Emx2 and Pax2, encode transcription factors that are also expressed in the M?llerian duct and may participate in a genetic pathway of uterine development. We will test their roles in uterine development by performing M?llerian duct-specific knockouts. In males, the fetal testes produce the TGF-beta family member anti-M?llerian hormone (AMH) that binds receptors expressed in the M?llerian duct mesenchyme, causing the elimination of the M?llerian ducts. The fetal ovaries do not produce AMH, permitting M?llerian duct differentiation. Thus, mammalian fetuses are initially ambi-sexual with the potential to develop both male and female reproductive tract organs. Defects in the formation of the genital ducts and resolution of the ambi-sexual state to a male or female phenotype lead to disorders of sexual development (DSD). We have preliminary RNA-seq data that has identified candidate genes expressed in male M?llerian duct mesenchyme but not in females that may mediate AMH-induced M?llerian duct regression. The in vivo role of a subset of these candidate genes (Msx-Dlx-Osterix) will be tested by M?llerian duct mesenchyme-specific knockout. The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular, cellular, and developmental mechanisms that regulate female reproductive tract organogenesis and M?llerian duct regression during male differentiation.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Penetrating recording microelectrode arrays are a crucial component of numerous human neuroprosthetics.  Obtaining selective, high fidelity, long-lasting readouts of brain activity is a critical technology across basic and applied neuroscience that impacts learning and memory studies as well as motor, pre-motor, and visual cortex neuroprostheses and brain-computer interfaces.  However, implantation of cortical microelectrodes causes a reactive tissue response, which results in a degradation of the preferred functional single-unit performance over time, thus limiting the device capabilities.  Insertion of neural probes or microelectrodes inevitably disrupts the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and causes microhemorrhages that have been shown to trigger the inflammatory tissue response cascade.  The degree of microhemorrhaging from probe insertion has been shown to be uncontrollable and difficult to reproduce across implants, mirroring the large variability in inflammatory tissue responses and chronic recording success.  We hypothesize that the level of BBB damage impacts chronic neural recording quality.  This proposal aims to characterize the sustained BBB breakdown and chronic recording failure in vivo caused by the insertion induced BBB disruption and BBB occlusion by quantifying structural, cellular, and molecular level tissue response to chronic implants in the brain in real time through combining multiphoton imaging technology and neural engineering technology at the University of Pittsburgh.  A dynamic understanding of the interfaces is necessary for elucidating the mechanism(s) behind neural recording failure.  This work has the potential to output basic and clinical science level knowledge relevant to neural engineering, ischemia, stroke, intracortical hemorrhage, aneurysm, traumatic brain injury, and closed-loop neurostimulation.',\n",
       " \"R01:Biomimetic Surface for Neural Implant PI: Tracy Cui Implantable microelectrode arrays for neural recording and stimulation have demonstrated tremendous research and clinical potential. Studies of brain tissue response to neural electrode arrays have revealed localized microglia activation, followed by astrocytic scarring and neural degeneration. These reactions are thought to contribute to the low yield and chronic failure of neural recording, although direct links have not been soundly established. Past studies characterizing the CNS response to implants have used postmortem histology at discrete time points. This approach suffers from a large degree of variability and fails to capture the dynamic molecular, cellular and vascular changes of the host. To address this issue, we have developed an experimental set-up to directly image the electrode-tissue interface in live animals using 2-photon microscopy in conjunction with electrical recording. Our previous work indicates that by coating the surface of neural probes with neural adhesion molecules, neuronal density around the device can be promoted while glial reaction attenuated. Meanwhile, neural recording quality is drastically improved. We hypothesize that promoting neuronal growth and health, and/or inhibiting microglia activation will lead to recording improvement. The specific objectives of this project are to investigate the biological mechanisms of the coating's effect on recording and to evaluate the clinical potential of biomimetic coating in a brain machine interface (BMI) model. First, the acute neuronal and microglia responses to coated probes will be characterized in transgenic animals using two photon imaging and electrical recording for two weeks. Real time tissue characteristics (such as neuronal and neurite density, microglia density and morphology, vasculature change and BBB leakage) will be correlated to recording metrics(such as unit yield, SNR, amplitude of signal and noise as well as impedance). Several biomolecules that promote or inhibit neuronal growth or microglia activation will be immobilized on the Blackrock arrays to test our hypothesis. Secondly, the long-term benefit of the coatings on recording will be determine by testing the optimum coating conditions in rats for 6 months. Explants will be taken monthly to examine the coating longevity, while immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis of the tissue at the interface will be performed to characterize the cellular and molecular change over time. Thirdly, to assess the potential of biomimetic coating for clinical application, coated electrodes will be tested in rhesus monkeys in a brain-machine-interface (BMI) model. Recording metrics such as SNR, signal amplitude, unit yield and stability will be quantified over 2 years and compared to uncoated arrays. A novel functional metric will be developed to assess functionality of the recorded signals. BMI performance will be evaluated based on speed and accuracy. This proposal combines the cutting edge real-time imaging, effective biomaterial strategies and state of the art brain machine interface technology to understand the interactions between neural implants and host tissue. The findings will guide the development of seamless neural interface devices for BMI, visual and auditory prosthesis, deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, depression and epilepsy, to name a few. The knowledge will also benefit other brain implants from biochemical sensing and therapeutic delivery to scaffold and stem cell transplant for treating neurological disorders.\",\n",
       " 'Ozone (O3) causes lung injury, exacerbates chronic pulmonary diseases, and increases susceptibility to respiratory infections. Epidemiological studies strongly associate air pollution exposures and incidence of respiratory infections, which is important since more than 1/3 of the United States population lives in areas exceeding the current O3 regulatory standards. Though O3 exposure clearly impairs pulmonary host defense, the specific molecular mechanisms enhancing respiratory pathogen susceptibility remain poorly understood. Defining these mechanisms requires linking molecular pathways modified by environmental pollutants to those critical to host- pathogen interactions. The scavenger receptor families are such a molecular pathway. In this proposal, we plan to study the scavenger receptor CD163 in O3-induced alterations of pulmonary immunity. CD163 is a class B scavenger receptor, expressed on monocytes and macrophages, which exists in both membrane-bound and soluble (sCD163) forms. Membrane CD163 clears cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) by recognizing and internalizing hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes. Once recognized by CD163, the complex is degraded by heme-oxygenase-1 into anti-inflammatory byproducts. Delayed CFH clearance augments inflammatory responses, exacerbates lung diseases, and modifies macrophage phagocytosis and apoptotic cell clearance (efferocytosis) resulting in persistent inflammation and defective pathogen clearance. Defining the role of CD163 in O3-mediated macrophage functions could uncover a novel mechanism mediating O3-induced adverse health effects. Our preliminary studies indicate that CD163 expression is upregulated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) macrophages from human subjects undergoing acute laboratory O3 exposure. Supporting the human data, mice exposed to O3 have increased BAL macrophage CD163 expression and BALF CFH. O3-exposed CD163 deficient mice demonstrate increased lung injury, neutrophilia and frequency of airspace apoptotic neutrophils. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that macrophage-dependent clearance of CFH is mediated by CD163, a mechanism that limits acute lung injury after O3, and maintains effective efferocytosis and pathogen phagocytosis. The studies proposed will define: 1) how CD163 limits pulmonary inflammation by promoting efferocytosis; and 2) how CD163 clearance of CFH maintains macrophage phagocytosis of pathogens. These studies are translational; integrating murine and human samples/observations. Completion of these studies would define a novel molecular pathway for O3-induced health effects and define a specific mechanism by which ambient pollutants mediate critical macrophage functions. Furthermore, studies with sCD163 could identify a therapeutic to mitigate O3-induced susceptibility to pulmonary infections.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Part C The aim of this project is to implement and evaluate a best practice Urologic Management Protocol for the Preservation of Renal Function (UPPF) in the Newborn/Young Child with Spina Bifida. The goal of the protocol is to develop standardized and effective urologic management in infants and young children with spina bifida, to preserve kidney function, lay the groundwork for long term continence and optimize long term health and well-being. It is estimated that 70,000 people in the United States are currently living  with spina bifida. The majority of patients with spina bifida experience urologic complications related to their condition, including incontinence and possibly renal damage. Over the past several decades, significant advancements have been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in children, which has allowed for earlier, more proactive therapeutic interventions aimed at the prevention of renal deterioration. Renal failure has historically been the leading cause of mortality in patients with myelomeningocele (MMC) followed through adulthood, reportedly accounting for a third of deaths. The significant impact of contemporary management with proactive urodynamic investigation, clean intermittent catheterization, antibiotic prophylaxis and anticholinergic therapy in children with MMC has shown a marked reduction in the rate of overall renal parenchymal damage. This project is innovative as it is a long term prospective study to test and evaluate the use of a standardized urologic management protocol for patients with spina bifida, beginning in the neonatal period. The data gathered through this project will provide researchers and clinicians with a robust database to test a systematic urologic protocol and to examine the long term urologic status of the population, enabling the development of evidence based clinical interventions to improve care outcomes and quality of life. Project objectives include outreach and education to CHLA faculty and staff, recruitment of 5-10 newborns per year from our Neonatal and Infant Critical Care Unit, implementation of the urologic protocol and collection and submission of data to the CDC, investigation of the effects of a standardized workflow on patient adherence and overall renal outcomes, assessment of parent and staff satisfaction with the urologic protocol, participation in research with other sites, and dissemination of findings.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Abstract: Influenza vaccination is the most effective means of preventing influenza virus infection and its more severe complications. Due to the changing nature of influenza viruses, active surveillance alongside regular updating of vaccine components and annual vaccination are necessary for vaccine protection. There is a need for annual evaluation of vaccine effectiveness (VE), which may vary from year to year. These estimates are critical to inform the medical community, maintain public confidence in the vaccine, and determine the effect of virus drift on protection. Modern study designs to assess VE require laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, sensitive and specific measures of vaccine receipt, and the use of a case test-negative design to control for differences in healthcare-seeking behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We propose to use these methods to estimate influenza VE in preventing influenza-associated ambulatory care visits in two health systems in Michigan, where we have been conducting annual assessments of VE since 2008. We will conduct surveillance at adult and pediatric outpatient clinics, and we will enroll patients seeking care for acute respiratory infections meeting a standard case definition. Vaccination status will be reported and documented, and considered with laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to estimate VE in preventing influenza- associated health care visits. Analyses will use the case test-negative design; those testing positive for influenza will be cases, those testing negative will be controls. Modifiers and confounders of VE such as age, health status, high-risk health conditions, education, time from illness onset to specimen collection, and calendar time will be assessed. We will also estimate the population-based incidence of medically-attended influenza and will identify infections due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory viruses in later years of the study. We will pilot methods to monitor the development of influenza virus resistance to antiviral medications which could inform similar studies carried out in a potential future influenza pandemic. In addition to our proposed influenza surveillance and VE assessment in the outpatient setting, we propose to continue our analyses of influenza VE and development of influenza antibodies among a prospectively followed cohort of households with children which has been in place since 2010. This cohort will be used to carry out complementary analyses of VE in preventing influenza illnesses of any severity which will be identified through ongoing active surveillance. Households in this cohort are followed for multiple years, enabling precise evaluations of repeated vaccination. Our current enrollment strategies will be augmented with targeted enrollment of households with children under age 3. Blood specimens will be collected from adults and children twice yearly; a third blood specimen will be collected from children < 3 years old 4 weeks after vaccination. The proposed work will enable the continuation of our established, coordinated, multi-faceted evaluation of influenza VE and development of antibodies in both ambulatory and community settings.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Master of Science in Occupational Health degree - Industrial Hygiene program ((MSOH-IH) was originally founded in 1985 and currently is offered by the Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine in the College of Medicine and Life Sciences at the University of Toledo Health Science Campus. This IH Program has been continuously accredited by the Applied Science Accreditation Commission - Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ASAC-ABET) for full (6- year) cycles since1996; with the last cycle approved for the period 2014-2020. The primary goal of the Program is to provide master-level education and training to full- and part-time graduate students and members of the public for the purpose of increasing their knowledge, comprehension, skills and attitudes essential to the advancement of occupational health and safety science, practice and research. This is accomplished via a combination of theoretical, practical and applied (i.e. case-based; problem-based) classroom, laboratory, and field teaching and research activities. The program educates and trains individuals mainly from Northwest Ohio region. In turn, graduates are employed as occupational health and safety specialists in the region. In addition, the program accepts students from outside the region and several alumni are employed in other areas throughout the USA, Canada, and Middle East countries. The Industrial Hygiene program adopted the ABET definition for Program Educational Objectives, that is, what the program graduates will be qualified to practice at the time of graduation and what most graduates will be able to achieve (e.g. certification; advanced degree; job promotion) a few years after graduation. The three Program Educational Objectives for the MSOH-IH program are: (1) AII graduates are expected to be qualified to practice comprehensive industrial hygiene. (2) Most graduates are expected to practice in the field of Industrial Hygiene or related areas of Environmental and/or Occupational Health and Safety and to meet the relevant and appropriate needs of their employers. (3) When eligible, based on degrees and post-graduate work experience (i.e. 4 years post-graduation), most graduates who pursue applicable certification in occupational health and safety (i.e. CIH; CSP; CHMM) will pass. The program is designed to educate and train 15-20 full-time (FT) or part-time (PT) students (~8 FTE) per year, with funding requested for the FT equivalent of 5 NIOSH trainees per year. Because the applicants to our Program are usually employed full-time and our classes are offered in the evenings and Saturdays, the NIOSH originally allowed us to award the scholarships to both FT and PT students. Since the last round of TPG funding (2009-2014) of the Program by NIOSH/CDC, the program has graduated 25 industrial hygienists (25/5=5/yr); 15 of those (60%; 3/yr), FT or PT, have been awarded scholarship from the funding. The program expects 16-17 IH students to be enrolled in the Program during the Fall semester 2014. As documented in this application, the IH program (a core discipline) at the University of Toledo has filled a critical gap in the Northwest Ohio workforce needs. .',\n",

Dta will be collected for each participant at one annual visit per year, using data recorded in the hospital electronic and paper medical record. Data analysis will be guided by the registry coordinating committee, and will be to identify best practices for SB care and future improvements to the registry.\",\n",
       " 'Despite important advancements in medical and surgical cancer treatments that prolong survival, veterans with oropharyngeal head and neck cancer (OP HNC) are faced with chronic, intractable dysphagia resulting in persistent drastic alterations in diet, the need for feeding tubes, and increased risk for aspiration pneumonia ? a life threatening infection. We must devote research and clinical efforts to mitigate these devastating impairments because currently our rehabilitative intervention options are severely limited. As such, and in keeping with the VHA?s Blueprint for Excellence Transformative Actions, the need for the development of effective swallowing interventions that show potential for rapid translation to clinical practice is imperative. Respiratory-swallow coordination is an essential element of airway protection during swallowing and facilitates many key aspects of swallowing physiology. This key coordinative event is significantly disrupted in patients who are dysphagic following medical and surgical treatments for OP HNC. [Our preliminary trial tested an innovative swallowing treatment approach developed in our clinical laboratory, respiratory-swallow training (RST), that targets respiratory-swallow coordination directly and resulted in compelling improvements in physiologic swallowing outcomes in veterans suffering from dysphagia that persisted long after traditional behavioral swallowing intervention(s). The goal of this proposed trial is to extend our preliminary study using a rigorous, randomized cross over design and determine the impact and durability of RST on clinical outcomes essential for eating, drinking, health, and quality-of-life in veterans with OP HNC. As such, positive results from the proposed trial have high significance and clinical relevance for veterans? health and well-being.] A total of 88 subjects will be recruited and randomly assigned 1:1 to either RST (intervention arm) or no active treatment (control arm), which is considered standard of care in this patient population. Data obtained will be used to evaluate clinical efficacy and durability. Data obtained from [an additional 11] subjects randomized to RST + home practice (HP) will be used to assess the feasibility of adjuvant HP program and to obtain preliminary data on its added impact on efficacy and response durability. The primary efficacy endpoint is Functional Oral Intake Scale level, and the secondary endpoint will be respiratory-swallow phase patterning. We will also elaborate on the impact of RST by detailing the physiological, airway protective, and morphometric changes that occur. We will use reproducible, reliable, and validated metrics that include the Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile, Penetration-Aspiration Scale, and Computational Analysis of Swallowing Mechanics to distinguish the mechanistic effects of RST. Further, adherence to a novel HP component using self-guided practice will be introduced and tested for feasibility and contribution to the degree and durability of the RST intervention effect. Our overarching goal is to provide two parallel tracks of knowledge generation: 1) provide immediate clinical translation of experimental findings to improve the lives of veterans, and 2) drive model generation on fundamental mechanisms of motor coordination. Basic knowledge will drive clinical application and vice-a- versa. As such, this is an ideal experimental and clinical context that will fuel knowledge generation in this highly significant area of science and clinical practice.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to develop and validate novel compressed sensing (CS) approaches to dramatically improve the spatial and temporal resolution of quantitative dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). CS exploits prior information (assumptions) about MR images to infer missing data and produce high-quality images from significantly less data than previously thought possible. CS has already proven extremely successful in MR angiography and cardiac MRI, where it has accelerated some acquisitions by up to 10- to 100-fold, but is relatively unexplored in cancer imaging. DCE-MRI involves the serial acquisition of heavily T1-weighted images before and after the injection of a contrast agent to increase water relaxation rates in tissues. The resultin data can then be analyzed with appropriate pharmacokinetic models to extract quantitative parameters reporting on, for example, vessel perfusion and permeability, and tissue volume fractions. DCE-MRI has been applied to predict the early response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer, but the technique is not yet robust and accurate enough for the clinic. A fundamental practical limitation of DCE-MRI is the necessity to simultaneously acquire high temporal resolution, to adequately sample the contrast time course, and high spatial resolution, which is required for clinical morphological assessment and accurate tumor delineation. In traditional Cartesian MRI acquisitions, one must choose between high spatial or high temporal resolution before the scan. With a golden ratio acquisition, the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution is eliminated. A single DCE-MRI scan may then be used for both accurate kinetic modeling by slicing the data at high temporal cadence, while also allowing a high spatial resolution image to be formed by taking the data as a whole. Thus, a golden ratio acquisition coupled with CS has great potential to enable a clinically relevant DCE-MRI protocol that provides adequate temporal resolution for kinetic modeling without sacrificing the spatial resolution required for morphological evaluation. This project has three aims: (1) to develop a compressed sensing based high temporal resolution protocol for quantitative DCE-MRI, (2) to develop a compressed sensing based high spatial resolution T1-weighted anatomical imaging protocol for morphological evaluation, and (3) to apply the developed CS-based protocols in vivo for validation and evaluation. If this project is successful, it will significantly improve te ability to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, provide new CS methods for the community to apply to other in vivo applications, and validate CS in an important cancer imaging application.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glycoprotein 130 (gp130) is a hub for a receptor-signaling complex for eight cytokines (IL6, IL-11, IL-27, LIF, CNTF, OSM, CT-1 and CLC). Although gp130 is positioned at the junction of this oncogenic signaling network and is essential for activation of the network, its role as a biomarker in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) progression remains unclear. Furthermore, there are no small-molecule inhibitors of gp130 under clinical development. Validation of gp130 as a biomarker and molecular target in EOC will facilitate the development of gp130-targeting agents and improve EOC therapy. Recently, we have identified first-in-class, efficacious, safe, and orally active inhibitors of gp130. Our preliminary study shows that gp130 is essential for the constitutive activation of Stat3 in EOC cells and supports cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Our lead gp130 inhibitor, SC144, selectively inhibits the activation of downstream signaling pathways induced by gp130 ligands (IL6, LIF), with no significant effects on the activation by non-gp130 ligands, such as IFN-?, SDF-1?, and PDGF. SC144 exhibits cytotoxicity in a panel of drug-sensitive and -resistant EOC cells, with no significant toxicity in human normal epithelial cells. In a mouse xenograft model bearing human EOC tumors, SC144 significantly inhibited tumor growth through gp130 inhibition and induction of necrosis in the tumor. No toxicity was evident in normal tissues. To our knowledge, SC144 is the first-in-class potent and orally active small-molecule gp130 inhibitor. Despite the important role of IL6 in EOC, it is unclear if gp130 can be considered a predictive marker. More significantly, selective inhibition of its signaling pathway in EOC subtypes, cancer stem-like cells, and drug resistance has not been studied. The overarching hypothesis of our study is that gp130 is an important biomarker and that patients with high expression of gp130 or constitutively active gp130 signaling will have poor prognosis and overall survival. We further hypothesize that inhibitors of gp130/Stat3 signaling pathway will effectively block EOC. To determine the significance of prognostic and predictive importance of gp130 as a biomarker in EOC, and assess the effect of its inhibition on patient sample derived tumor growth, we propose the following aims. Aim 1: To validate gp130 as a therapeutic target and a novel biomarker in a large panel of EOC cell lines and patient tissues. Aim 2: To determine in vivo efficacy of SC144, as a single agent and in combination with carboplatin in patient-derived xenografts models from na?ve and drug-resistant patients. Aim 3: To elucidate the role of gp130 and its inhibition by SC144 in EOC stem cells and drug resistance and in our novel murine EOC model with human tumor stroma.',\n",

(UFC) in Fortaleza, Brazil. This experience is the strong foundation for strengthening our collaboration with the University of Venda (UNIVEN), a model, innovative, former homeland university in Limpopo Province in the northeast of South Africa, near the borders with Zimbabwe and Mozambique. UNIVEN is clearly poised to become a world-class research, teaching and service university, much like UFC was in northeast Brazil 20 years ago. Furthermore, UNIVEN attracts graduate students from other southern African countries such as Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Like South Africa, these countries are also experiencing acute shortages of trained individuals to help seek solutions to their particular human development problems. We believe our experience and lessons learned in Brazil have begun to take root at UNIVEN. We also believe that the transfer of our GIDRT program from Brazil to South Africa provides an opportunity to firmly establish infectious disease training at a site with limited training opportunities, a large burden of diseas, and a small, but growing research infrastructure. At UNIVEN, we have, in close collaboration with Dr. Pascal Bessong, formerly a Fogarty-supported trainee who is now Chair of Microbiology at UNIVEN, developed a cutting edge research program as well as research infrastructure. We have achieved this in part through our collaborative major Malnutrition and Enteric Disease Network (MAL-ED) study. This project, funded by an award from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), has supported Dr. Bessong, as he has led the establishment of a major new site for study of diarrheal illnesses and their long-term consequences. Given this success, we are now poised to take intervention science - applying our best science to testing novel approaches to disease control and improving health - to a whole new level by linking the laboratory bench to the bedside to the community and, importantly in our model, to come back from the community to the bench to elucidate novel interventions.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unlike to ion pump bacteriorhodopsin homologues, microbial sensory rhodopsin-transducer molecular complexes served a key paradigm for exploring the chemistry of protein-protein interaction in signaling cascade. In 2003, freshwater cyanobacterium Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120 revealed a chromosomal gene encoding a sensory rhodopsin analogue. In contrast to haloarchaeal sensory rhodopsin, it does not contain any membrane transducer gene product. However, an adjacent gene product is indicated to be a soluble transducer molecule for this photoreceptor. The detailed molecular mechanism of photoactivated receptor mediated signaling is not known. The proposed model is not related to any known microbial sensory based phototaxis. However, it is analogous to visual photoreceptor, rhodopsin and to other G- protein coupled signaling via cytoplasmic components. Thus the role of this soluble putative transducer protein may establish a novel mode of signaling as shared by haloarchaea and eukarya. Interestingly, this putative soluble transducer molecule is present in a series of microbial species that do not contain sensory rhodopisn photoreceptor. Sequential and structural fold homology reveals such molecule without any established functional feature. Genome database search revealed their presence in broad microbial population including various pathogens. The homologue sequence of a transducer present in other sequences is referred to as domain of unidentified function [DUF], family. This family includes pathogens, such as Tropheryma, Actinomyces and Thermobifida. The atomic resolution structures of both photoreceptor and putative transducer are available. Structural motif based bioinformatics analysis has revealed that the transducer homologue may be classified as a member of a super family of microbial small carbohydrate binding domain. It is likely that it may serve as a novel carbohydrate binding module in a unique beta sandwich framework. Our preliminary data, based on unipolar localization suggests strong correlation and affinity to bacterial cellulose synthesis proteins that specifically localizes at pole. Recent NMR study has shown a eukaryotic like interaction of this transducer with DNA. Further, sequence- based analysis prediction along with initial data from PI's work supports the phosphor-accepting property of the transducer protein. Additionally, the phosphorylation leads to impair the unusual stability of transducer, suggesting its putative role in signaling. The unusual stable assembly and its segregation of this putative transducer protein would elucidate the signaling state of this DUF protein molecule. This project is aimed to relate the functional state of transducer as a phosphor-acceptor module and presence of a sugar binding motif and characterize the modulation of such a feature on receptor binding. The characterization of transducer's signaling state would broaden our understanding towards other DUF members including various pathogens as well.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A series of marine natural products isolated from the sponge of Verongida have been intensively studied due to the presence of alkaloids with one, or more bromotyrosine residues. Many of these alkaloid metabolites show interesting bioactivity and cytotoxic properties in tumor cell lines. The natural product, 11-Deoxyfistularin-3 is cytotoxi against the estrogen dependant human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 (LD50 = 17 mg/L). The World Health Organization (WHO) recently predicted that death caused by cancer is expected to increase to 13.1 million by 2030. Among all other deadly cancers, invasive breast cancer is the most recurrently diagnosed malignant tumor among women (31% in the US and 27% in Europe) and the second leading cause of cancer related death subsequent to lung cancer. Women have a 32% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and 15% risk of breast cancer causing death in the US. We plan to address the challenge of improving the aforementioned statistics through developing derivatives of the natural product, 11-deoxyfustularin-3, that will have sub-micromolar activity against MCF-7 breast cancer. This research project has three main objectives. The first objective is to develop a synthetic methodology that can be applied toward the asymmetric total synthesis of the biologically active natural product, 11-deoxyfistularin-3. Secondly, we plan to construct synthetic analogues of the natural product to determine if a segment of the natural product can also display biological activity against MCF-7 cells. Our final objective is to determine if any of the MCF-7 active synthetic analogues and the natural product can effectively bind to estrogen receptors. The data generated from these binding assays will lead to theoretical docking studies of the ligand-receptor interactions of the biologically active compound and the estrogen receptor, and the generation of a structure-activity relationship profile of these compounds could potentially lead to the construction of synthetic analogues that possess sub-micromolar activity against breast cancer cells.',\n",
       " 'Krabbe disease (Globoid-cell leukodystrophy, GLD) is an inherited childhood disease caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme, galactosyl-ceramidase (GALC). In the absence of GALC activity a highly cytotoxic lipid, galactosyl-sphingosine (psychosine, Psy) accumulates and preferentially causes the death of oligodendrocytes. Krabbe disease affects the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS) leading to irritability, sensory deterioration, motor defects, seizures, and cognitive deficits beginning at 6 months of age and death occurs by 2-5 years of age. There is currently no effective therapy for Krabbe disease. In addition, all the evidence from years of research in authentic animal models of Krabbe disease shows that no single treatment provides meaningful long-term benefits. However, we recently showed that a combination therapy approach that simultaneously targets the primary pathogenic mechanism (GALC deficiency) and secondary consequences of GALC deficiency (psychosine accumulation, inflammation, etc) dramatically and synergistically increases efficacy. Although Krabbe disease was described over 100 years ago and the murine model has been available for nearly 40 years, we know surprisingly little about the pathogenesis of the disease. This is largely to the confounding effects of cross-correction. We have created a chimeric form of GALC that retains enzyme activity, prevents the accumulation of psychosine and is incapable of cross- correcting surrounding cells. This novel reagent will now enable us to determine both the contribution of cross- correction to various therapeutic strategies and the role of specific cell types in the pathogenesis of Krabbe disease. The goals of this proposal are to 1) determine the efficacy of newly developed substrate reduction therapy drugs alone and in combination, 2) determine the mechanism/s by which certain therapies interact to synergistically increase efficacy, 3) determine the role of specific cell types in the pathogenesis of Krabbe disease, and 4) determine the mechanism/s by which psychosine is generated and potentially uncover a new substrate reduction target. We will accomplish these goals with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: We will determine the therapeutic efficacy of a CGT-specific SRT drug, BMNS202, alone and in  combination with HSCT and AAV-mediated gene therapy. Aim 2: We will determine the role of HSCT in the synergy observed when combined with CNS-directed AAV-  mediated gene therapy in the murine model of Krabbe disease. Aim 3: We will determine the role of specific cell types in the pathogenesis of Krabbe disease. Aim 4: We will determine the role of acid ceramidase in the catabolic production of psychosine and the  pathogenesis of Krabbe disease.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT ABSTRACT Epilepsy surgery involving the anteromedial temporal lobe (ATL) often results in deficits of language or memory. The best clinical predictor of postsurgical cognitive deficits is the extent to which tissues around the epileptogenic focus were spared during resection. We recently showed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) can predict normative variance in higher-order cognition; rs-FC has subsequently been shown to outperform lesion-based analyses for modeling stroke-related deficits of higher-order cognitions including memory. The proposed retrospective analyses of existing datasets will evaluate the prognostic value of rs-FC for modeling presurgical deficits of language and memory among patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 1 will replicate our methodology for relating rs-FC to cognitive ability using an independent normative sample of healthy control subjects acquired at Emory University. Aim 2 will evaluate the clinical utility of our method by modeling the influence of clinical symptoms (such as seizure frequency and laterality of epileptogenic focus) upon the relationship between rs-FC and presurgical memory and/or language deficits within a sample of patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 3 will use machine learning approaches to evaluate rs-FC's ability to explain presurgical cognitive deficits relative to other MRI modalities (such as anatomic volume, cortical thickness, white matter integrity, and task-based fMRI activity). The proposed model-based and hypothesis- driven research plan would critically evaluate resting-state fMRI's prognostic capability to explain epilepsy- related cognitive deficits, and thus establish the necessary methodological groundwork for future prospective analyses using rs-FC to predict postsurgical cognitive outcomes.\",\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prevention of hospitalization has long been viewed as a major health benefit of the use of influenza vaccine. This was, in large part, the rationale for the initial vaccination programs targeting the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.  However, in the last decade, questions have been raised about the value of such programs. Modern study designs to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) have required laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, as well as documentation of vaccine receipt and the use of a test-negative design to control for differences in healthcare-seeking behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. There is a need for current estimates of VE in preventing influenza-associated hospitalization using these methods. We propose estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza hospitalization in two health systems in Michigan, where we have been conducting annual assessments of VE in various populations since 2008. We will conduct surveillance at two hospitals, and will enroll adult in-patients with acute respiratory infection. Vaccination status will be reported and documented, and considered with laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to estimate vaccine effectiveness for prevention of hospitalization. Analyses will use a test- negative design; those testing positive for influenza ar cases, those testing negative are controls. Modifiers and confounders of vaccine effectiveness such as age, health status, high-risk health conditions, functional status, frailty, education, tim from illness onset to specimen collection, calendar time, and propensity for vaccination will be assessed. In addition to our proposed influenza surveillance and VE assessment, we propose an estimation of the incidence of hospitalization in adults due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV and other respiratory viruses. This will allow for the evaluation of bias in influenza VE assessment due to interaction between influenza vaccination, infection, and non-influenza respiratory viruses, and will establish a platform for the future evaluation of RSV vaccines. We will accomplish these additional objectives by expanding our surveillance to months before and after the typical influenza season and evaluating specimens by molecular methods for RSV and other respiratory viruses.',\n",

We plan to systematically evaluate the influenza VE with the CDC ACIP recommended annual universal immunization strategy in the Baylor Scott & White Health, Central Texas (BSWCTX) patient population. The objective is to obtain reliable vaccination information for the enrolled population and provide accurate estimates of annual VE to prevent influenza-associated medically-attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) in the vaccine age-eligible population. Our central hypothesis is that timely and efficient measurement of annual VE and burden of illness due to seasonal/pandemic influenza, RSV and other respiratory viruses is sustainable. The rationale is that by assessing the mid-season VE, ACIP can recommend antiviral chemoprophylaxis and treatment for high risk groups, as needed. To accomplish the overall objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: 1) Assess influenza VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza among at least 1,000 children and adults, including at least 333 persons from each of three age groups (6 months ? 17 years, 18-49 years and ?50 years) with MAARI in ambulatory settings during each of 5 seasons from 2016-17, with at least 100 among young children aged 6 months ? 8 years and with at least 100 among adults aged ?65 years. 2) Evaluate disease burden due to seasonal influenza (during each of 5 seasons from 2016-17), RSV and other respiratory viruses (during seasons 3-5) among children (ages 6 months ? 17 years), adults (ages 18-64 years) and older adults (ages ?65 years). 3) Develop influenza pandemic preparedness operational plan and pilot research methods (during seasons 3-5) to describe the epidemiology of the novel influenza virus infection, beginning whenever the next influenza pandemic is imminent anywhere in the world, estimate MAARI incidence of pandemic influenza, estimate VE of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for prevention of pandemic influenza-associated MAARI, and evaluate the use and effectiveness of antiviral agents for treatment of pandemic influenza. To accomplish these goals, we will estimate real-time VE for the enrolled population in the ambulatory setting using a test-negative design, estimate burden of illness of seasonal/pandemic influenza, RSV and other respiratory viruses in the BSWCTX source population, and examine factors associated with VE. The proposed research is innovative in that it will generate new knowledge in the methods used to aptly measure influenza VE in different healthcare settings and measure burden of illness of influenza, RSV and other respiratory viruses in the West South Central region of the U.S.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is a very prevalent cancer, affecting approximately 630,000 people per year. While every cancer has unique characteristics, HNSCC is especially heterogenous due to a variety of tissue origins and mutations. Inactivating mutations in Notch1 occur in 15-20% of HNSCC cases, a marked difference from the prevalence of Notch1 amplifications in other cancers. While Notch1 mutations are especially aggressive and associated with poor prognosis, we have also seen that they are associated with reduced expression of co-inhibitory receptors on immune cells. While co-inhibitory receptors are associated with immune exhaustion, they are also a natural consequence of immune cell activation. The reduced expression of inhibitory receptors in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is likely a sign of reduced immune activation. We will investigate the effect of Notch1 loss on the immunosuppressive environment in HNSCC and determine how this important signaling molecule might be impacting immunosurveillance. On the other side of the tumor-immune interaction, the other important question remains how to best block immune inhibition. Anti- PD-1 therapy has been a popular new treatment, but is only effective in 10-20% of cases. However, PD-1 is not the only inhibitory receptor on immune cells, and others such as lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) are equally important. We will investigate how dual inhibition of these receptors can be optimized with respect to timing and strategic targeting of different receptors. The findings of these studies are expected to develop new approaches to cancer immunotherapy and optimizing strategies to existing immunotherapy treatments.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Over the past 20 years, remarkable progress has been made in our understanding of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and of the congenital and acquired neurointestinal diseases that result from abnormal development or maintenance of the ENS. Many of the advances in understanding ENS development have been made by cell, molecular, and developmental biology studies and genetic analyses using a variety of species, including avians, rodents, zebrafish, and humans. These fundamental studies have contributed not only a detailed appreciation of the complexities of ENS development, but are now also yielding novel opportunities to develop cell-based therapies for treating enteric neuropathies. Researchers studying ENS development gathered in New York in 2006 for their first international symposium. This triennial meeting was subsequently held in London (2009), Hong Kong (2012), and Rotterdam (2015). The symposium brings together clinicians and researchers, including developmental and cell biologists, pathologists, geneticists, physiologists, pediatric gastroenterologists and surgeons, and stem cell researchers, who all share a common interest in the development and pathophysiology of the enteric nervous system and the diagnosis and treatment of neurointestinal diseases. All of the Symposia have been very successful, each hosting approximately 150 participants from 20 different countries from around the world. The 5th International Symposium on ?Development of the Enteric Nervous System: Cells, Signals, Genes and Therapy? will be held in Boston in April, 2018. This will be the first meeting focused on ENS development to be held in the U.S. in 12 years and builds on the success of the prior meetings and the growing importance of ENS research. The specific aims of this R13 application are as follows: (1) To encourage the participation of young investigators, particularly women and minorities under-represented in science, at this 5th International Symposium by offering 10 Travel Awards to offset registration costs and travel expenses; and (2) To enhance the likelihood of long-term success for young investigators pursuing academic careers by establishing mentored relationships with select faculty and members of the meeting?s Organizing Committee. It is our expectation that this meeting will help to build lasting mentorship and collaborations that will help to advance the career development of the Travel Award recipients.',\n",
       " 'Program Description/Abstract Lineage commitment and maintenance are fundamental processes in a variety of biological systems. In the immune system, dysregulated T cell responses are the cause of many allergic and inflammatory disorders. TH17 cells play a key pathogenic role in Multiple sclerosis (MS) and its murine model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). A unique feature of TH17 cells is their inherent plasticity that endows mature effector TH17 cells with characteristics of other T cell subsets especially TH1 cells, but how this process is controlled and its functional significance remain elusive. Coordination of T cell metabolic programs with cell fate decisions is a fundamental process in adaptive immunity, but how metabolic pathways intersect with immune signals in T cell fate decisions and autoimmune dysregulation is poorly defined. In particular, the function of metabolic programs in effector T cell plasticity and pathogenicity remains essentially unexplored. Our preliminary results identified the key roles of mTORC1 and metabolic pathways in the programming of pathogenic responses in effector TH17 cells. Loss of mTORC1 activity in TH17 cells via the Il17aCre deletion system abrogated neuroinflammation and tissue damage in EAE. Mechanistically, mTORC1 inhibition impaired the ability of TH17 cells to transition into T-bethi IFN?-expressing terminally differentiated cells, associated with altered transcriptional responses and metabolic activities. Unexpectedly, using cutting-edge ATAC-Seq and single cell RNA-Seq technologies, we found that inhibition of mTORC1 induced TCF-1 expression and endowed TH17 cells with stem cell-like features. We hypothesize that the inherent heterogeneity of TH17 cells underlies their lineage plasticity; the balance between terminal differentiation and sustained stemness depends upon mTORC1 signaling and metabolic reprogramming, and contributes to autoimmune inflammation. Aim 1. Determine transcriptional mechanisms and developmental trajectory underlying TH17 terminal differentiation and stemness. Aim 2. Establish the signaling and metabolic mechanisms of mTORC1 in TH17 responses. Aim 3. Establish metabolic control and signaling circuits of TH17 plasticity. There has been little description of molecular pathways regulating TH17 lineage plasticity. We argue that insight into metabolic control of TH17 plasticity could establish a new paradigm of T cell fate control mechanisms, and manifest legitimate therapeutic opportunities for autoimmune diseases.',\n",
       " \"Abstract  In New York, the achievement of 90-90-90 goals is jeopardized not by limited access to affordable care and treatment, but by persistent disparities in HIV viral suppression (VS). Complex behavioral and structural barriers to achieving and maintaining VS require coordinated, combination approaches to meet medical and social service needs. In 2009, at 28 Ryan White Part A (RWPA)-funded agencies, the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) launched a multi-component HIV Care Coordination Program (CCP) directed toward the most vulnerable, high-need persons living with HIV (PLWH) in NYC. A systematic CCP effectiveness study began in 2013 (R01 MH101028; PIs: Irvine, Nash). Findings to date suggest that the CCP is superior to usual care for high-need subgroups of PLWH, but there remains substantial room for improvement in short- and long-term VS. In an immediate evidence-to- practice feedback loop, the DOHMH is implementing a refined CCP model in 2018. Greater focusing, tailoring and cues for delivery of key components are expected to increase CCP engagement, reach, fidelity, scalability, effectiveness and impact. The aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Estimate the effectiveness of the revised (vs. original) CCP on timely VS (?4 months), using experimental methods (Aim 1); 2) Estimate the effectiveness of the revised CCP (vs. `usual care') on longer-term VS, including VS at 12 months and durable viral suppression (DVS) at 24-36 months, using rigorous observational comparison group methods (Aim 2); and 3) Identify attributes and drivers of provider and client engagement in the intervention and provider and client preferences for future revised-CCP delivery and receipt (Aim 3). Prior studies have not demonstrated any intervention to be effective at improving short- and long-term VS among the many PLWH with major barriers to HIV care continuum engagement. The proposed study, to be conducted on a large scale in real-world HIV service settings, will document the rollout and effects of evidence-informed implementation course corrections to an intervention model focused on these most vulnerable PLWH. In this way, the work will advance a second generation of interventions capable of strengthening the care continuum among PLWH who have been unable to achieve desired ART outcomes in existing interventions, due to major structural or psychosocial barriers.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer is one of the top ten most common cancers in the U.S., contributing to over 60,000 new cases and 10,000 deaths annually. The majority of cases (70-80%) are diagnosed at early stage (termed non-muscle invasive), yet the cancer typically recurs (50-80%), with a subset further progressing to muscle- invasive disease with poor survival. Due to this markedly high recurrence and progression, patients are followed intensively by cystoscopy with repeat transurethral manipulation, making bladder cancer one of the most costly diseases. Cruciferous vegetable intake has been associated with reduced risk of primary bladder cancer and improved survival, which might be partly attributable to their unique phytochemical isothiocyanates (ITCs). Dietary ITCs are promising chemopreventive agents with multi-faceted anti-cancer mechanisms. Our prior in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiologic studies strongly support dietary ITCs and ITC-rich cruciferous vegetables playing a key role in preventing bladder cancer recurrence and progression and improving prognosis. Above all, via metabolic pathways in humans, orally ingested ITCs are rapidly delivered to the bladder and concentrated in the urine, rendering bladder cancer the best target for their anti-cancer activities.  This application requests to conduct a new prospective cohort study of 1,811 newly diagnosed non- muscle invasive bladder cancer patients in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and Southern California (KPSC) Medical Care Programs. Our goal is to comprehensively examine the role of cruciferous vegetable intake, in conjunction with genetic polymorphisms related to ITC metabolism, in potentially reducing disease recurrence and progression, and increasing the efficacy of intravesical treatment. We propose to investigate: 1) the associations between cruciferous vegetable intake and bladder cancer recurrence and progression; 2) the modifying effect of polymorphisms of ITC-metabolizing genes on the associations between cruciferous vegetable intake and bladder cancer recurrence and progression; and 3) the effects of the interactions between cruciferous vegetable intake and therapeutic agents on bladder cancer recurrence and progression. Furthermore, we propose to establish the largest prospective cohort of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients with longitudinal questionnaire data and banked biospecimens for further future research of bladder cancer outcomes including survival and quality of life.  Bladder cancer is an extremely understudied disease considering its disproportionate high incidence and recurrence, high cost of clinical management, and significant impact on quality of life. The proposed study within one of the largest U.S. integrated health care settings will be the first to investigate the role of dit in recurrence and progression of the disease, with genetic profiles taken into consideration to identify those who will benefit most. Considering the wide availability of cruciferous vegetables in the U.S., this study could have an immediate impact on bladder cancer prognosis.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polycystic kidney diseases (PKD) are a group of inherited nephropathies characterized by the formation of fluid-filled cysts along the nephron. Autosomal Recessive form of PKD (ARPKD) has an incidence of 1 in 20,000 live births; infants with this disease that survive beyond the perinatal period develop chronic renal failure by adolescence and eventually require kidney transplantation. This proposal focuses on the sodium transport regulation in the renal collecting ducts in ARPKD and potential means of pharmacological intervention with the cysts' progression. Specifically, we have determined that Epithelial Sodium Channels (ENaCs), which are expressed in the collecting ducts and represent the rate-limiting step of sodium reabsorption in this nephron segment, are involved into the process of cystogenesis in the ARPKD setting. Our preliminary data indicate that ENaC expression and activity are significantly lower in the cystic epithelial cells of a rat model of ARPKD, as assessed with immunohistochemistry and single channel analysis in isolated cysts; furthermore, chronic administration of the ENaC-specific inhibitor, benzamil, aggravated cyst formation. Thus, we propose that ENaC inhibition exacerbates PKD progression. Using a novel enzymatic microbiosensors approach we established that concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was significantly higher in PCK rat cortical cysts compared to control rats. ATP was shown to inhibit ENaC via signaling cascades initiated by binding to its receptors. Therefore, we hypothesize here that accumulation of excessive levels of ATP in the lumen of the dilated collecting ducts affects specific purinergic receptors in the cystic cells (primary candidates being P2Y2 or P2X7) and results in ENaC inhibition; this suppresses normal sodium reabsorption in these collecting ducts, and thus promotes fluid accumulation and cysts' expansion. The integrative experimental approach used in this study will include single nephron electrophysiology, in vivo animal studies, genetics, biochemistry, biosensors amperometry and confocal microscopy and will address the clinically relevant problem of cyst expansion in ARPKD. Specifically, this proposal will identify the involvement of the ATP- triggered signaling into regulation of sodium reabsorption in this setting. This proposal will address the following specific aims: 1. Determine the relationship between ENaC activity and cystogenesis in ARPKD; 2. Elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanism by which excessive levels of ATP modulate sodium transport, promoting cyst growth; and 3. Explore if P2 receptor agonists/antagonists and suppression of the ATP levels can affect cystogenesis.\",\n",
       " 'Summary The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling by endocytic trafficking. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of signaling receptors expressed in the mammalian genome, mediate cellular responses to diverse stimuli and control vast physiological responses. Dysregulated GPCR signaling has been implicated in neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases and cancer progression, making this receptor class the target of nearly half the drugs used clinically. In addition to desensitization, GPCR trafficking is crucial for the temporal and spatial control of receptor signaling. This is best exemplified by protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), a GPCR for the coagulant protease thrombin. PAR1 has important functions in vascular physiology and development as well as tumor progression and is an important drug target. Similar to most GPCRs, signaling by activated PAR1 is rapidly desensitized. We also found that activated PAR1 internalization and lysosomal sorting is critical for shutting-off PAR1 signaling. We also discovered that activated PAR1 trafficking is altered in metastatic breast carcinoma and contributes to tumor progression. However, the mechanisms responsible for PAR1 trafficking are not known. Many GPCRs are modified with ubiquitin and sorted to lysosomes through interactions with ubiquitin-binding components of the ESCRT machinery. However, not all GPCRs require ubiquitination for lysosomal sorting including PAR1. We recently discovered a novel lysosomal sorting pathway that bypasses the requirement for ubiquitination and ubiquitin-binding ESCRTs and is mediated ALIX. ALIX, a CHMP4/ESCRT-III interacting protein, bound to YPX3L motif of PAR1 via its V domain to facilitate lysosomal sorting. This pathway may be applicable to a subset of GPCRs containing YPXnL motifs. Our studies further indicate that the ALIX interacting protein arrestin-related protein -3 (ARRDC3) regulates PAR1 degradation. ARRDC3 appears to function as a tumor suppressor and its expression is lost in invasive breast carcinoma that exhibit dysregulated PAR1 trafficking. This proposal is focused on delineating the molecular mechanisms by which ARRDC3 and ALIX regulate GPCR ubiquitin-independent lysosomal sorting and signaling, and the contribution to breast cancer progression. The specific aims of the proposal are to: 1) determine the function of ARRDC3 in GPCR lysosomal sorting, 2) delineate the regulatory mechanisms of ALIX function in lysosomal sorting of GPCRs, and 3) examine the role of ARRDC3 in dysregulated GPCR trafficking in cancer.',\n",
       " 'The concept of the pathogenesis of asthma has evolved from the 1960s viewpoint of asthma as being a disorder having a primary defect in lung smooth muscle requiring treatment with beta agonists, to the current paradigm of asthma being a disease primarily due to airway inflammation. The goal of this UCSD AADCRC U19 program is to challenge the current paradigm that asthma is solely a disease of airway inflammation which induces structural changes in the airway, by proposing that asthma is a disease of both lung structural cells (smooth muscle) as well as airway inflammation (in particular controlled by T cells and ILC2) and that developing therapeutic strategies to target both airway structural cells and immune/inflammatory cells is needed to control severe asthma with airway remodeling. In this regard, atopic dermatitis, is a good example of a disease that is part of the atopic march to asthma which is characterized not only by skin inflammation, but also in a subset by a genetic defect in a skin structural gene filaggrin. Similarly, we hypothesize that there are lung structural gene defects in asthma that predispose to airway remodeling in asthma. In support of this hypothesis preliminary data in Project 1 (Broide) provides evidence that ORMDL3, a gene highly linked to childhood asthma and severe asthma, when expressed in smooth muscle contributes to smooth muscle remodeling in the absence of an exogenous inflammatory stimulus. Thus, the goal of the program is to demonstrate that airway remodeling in asthma may be mediated by a combination of pathways intrinsic to structural cells in the lung (e.g. ORMDL3 expressed in smooth muscle)(Broide, Project 1), interacting with exogenous immune (T cells) and inflammatory (ILC2/macrophage) pathways to induce smooth muscle, fibroblast and epithelial remodeling. In this regard, our preliminary data demonstrates that LIGHT and TL1A (derived from T cells/macrophages) drives smooth muscle, fibroblast and epithelial remodeling (Croft, Project 2), while T cells and ILC2 express CD6 which interacts with ALCAM on smooth muscle to mediate bidirectional signaling activating T cells and ILC2 to proliferate and express pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as smooth muscle to proliferate (Doherty, Project 3). The hypothesis in each project will be tested in human asthma clinical samples (sputum, blood, endobronchial biopsy, as well as post mortem lung and lung lymph nodes) provided by Human Asthma Clinical Core B directed by David Broide (UCSD), and co- investigators Richard Kurten (University of Arkansas) and Qutayba Hamid (McGill University).',\n",

       " 'Project Summary/Abstract: The basal ganglia are a richly interconnected group of subcortical brain nuclei that are critical for the motivation, selection, initiation and execution of actions. Consistent with these roles, dysfunction of the basal ganglia is linked to a range of debilitating psychomotor disorders including Parkinson?s disease, Huntington?s disease, dystonia, addiction, obsessive compulsive disorder and Tourette?s syndrome. The significance of the basal ganglia for both health and disease, together with the development and refinement of experimental approaches for their interrogation, have motivated the formation of large basic, translational and clinical research communities focused on these structures. Despite the importance of basal ganglia research there was until the inaugural 2014 Basal Ganglia Gordon Research Conference (GRC) only one meeting dedicated to the basal ganglia, ?IBAGS?, a triennial international meeting that is mostly held outside the USA. Furthermore, in contrast to the more interactive, discussion-focused format of a GRC, the IBAGS meeting utilizes a conventional symposium format. In 2016 the Basal Ganglia GRC incorporated a 1.5 day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) organized by and exclusively for pre- and post-doctoral trainees. The success of the 2014 and 2016 meetings recently led the GRC board to approve the Basal Ganglia GRC & GRS as a regular, biennial meeting. The programs for the 2018 Basal Ganglia GRC & GRS were designed by an interdisciplinary committee guided by suggestions from the field. Thus, the 2018 meeting has an almost entirely new roster of speakers and covers topics that have previously received little attention including basal ganglia development, striosomes/patches, involvement of the basal ganglia in neuropsychiatric disorders, interactions of the basal ganglia with the wider motor system and basal ganglia connectomics. The unique format of the GRC and GRS, with a focus on unpublished data, discussion, and diversity in a respectful and nurturing environment, is of immense value to the basic, translational, and clinical scientific research communities and a key catalyst for basal ganglia research worldwide. The 2018 Basal Ganglia GRC and GRS have 3 specific aims: 1) accelerate advances in basal ganglia research by showcasing groundbreaking research in a uniquely interactive and respectful environment that fosters critical thinking, challenges dogma, identifies major unanswered questions, and builds collaboration and collegiality 2) promote diversity in basal ganglia research in terms of scientific approach and subject, gender balance, career stage, and minority representation through targeted programming and attendee selection and support 3) inspire, educate and mentor early career scientists at a critical phase of their careers through exposure to diverse, cutting-edge research, career mentorship, free and open discussion with more established scientists, and opportunities for scientific presentation and communication. Successful completion of these aims will strengthen and diversify research on the basal ganglia, thus accelerating discovery and translation to the clinic, consistent with the core mission of NIH.',\n",
       " \"Summary/Abstract Although influenza vaccination is the best available tool for reducing illnesses and deaths due to influenza, influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary substantially from year to year, depending on the antigenic match between circulating viruses and vaccine strains. To guide the ongoing development of influenza vaccination recommendations, we propose to conduct annual estimates of influenza VE, influenza burden of illness, and cases prevented by vaccination. We will conduct active surveillance for medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza in a predefined cohort. We will identify patients seeking ambulatory care for acute respiratory illness; eligible and consenting patients will be enrolled in the study. We will collect specimens for respiratory virus testing from all participants, which will be tested for influenza (including type, subtype, and lineage) via nucleic acid amplification. We will determine risk factors for influenza, and illness outcomes, through a combination of questionnaires and administrative healthcare databases. We will determine subjects' influenza vaccination history through self-report, validated using an immunization registry. Data will be shared with CDC and other participating sites to provide mid-season and end-of-season VE estimates. We will estimate VE using a test-negative design, comparing the odds of vaccination among subjects who test positive for influenza with the odds among subjects testing negative. We will provide annual estimates stratified by virus type/subtype/lineage and by age group. Because we are identifying patients with influenza from a defined cohort, we will also estimate the incidence of medically attended influenza in our study population, and estimate the number of influenza cases averted by vaccination.  This project will also serve as a resource for studying VE and epidemiology of a novel influenza virus, should an influenza pandemic occur during the study period. We will work with CDC and other sites to prepare and pilot-test protocols for pandemic studies. In addition, this project provides a platform for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) surveillance, which can provide important data on the epidemiology of RSV prior to licensure of RSV vaccines. We will test specimens for RSV and estimate the incidence of medically attended RSV in our study population. Finally, we will use data collected from this study to further explore potential biases and limitations of the test-negative design and to anticipate possible effects of RSV vaccine licensure on influenza VE estimates from test-negative studies.  The proposed research will 1) generate data to guide influenza prevention actions and recommendations; 2) provide baseline data on RSV incidence prior to vaccine licensure; and 3) enhance our understanding of the test-negative study design.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract: The attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) on 9/11/2001 (9/11) involved collision of two aircraft into the buildings and the combustion of many thousands of pounds of jet fuel. The subsequent collapse on the towers, and the rescue/recovery effort that followed, led to large numbers of responders being exposed to a wide variety of hazardous material including pulverized cement, glass, asbestos, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated furans and dioxins (1-3). Three research centers that follow cohorts of rescue and recovery workers since the WTC disaster include the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY); the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS); and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). Modest though mostly non-statistically significantly elevated cancer rates post-exposure to the WTC-site have been reported in all three of the cohorts, despite limited follow-up time since 9/11/2001 (4-7). We propose to combine these three cohorts to account for individuals who are in more than one cohort, to increase the sample size, and to make the results more generalizable. We plan to update the incidence findings from the prior reports using consistent exposure and outcome definitions and taking advantage of the additional six years of follow-up since those publications. We also plan to study the time elapsed from WTC- exposure to increased incidence of WTC-associated cancer. We believe that this short-term high intensity exposure with long-term follow-up in responder cohorts, combined for these analyses, offers a rare opportunity to investigate cancer latency in humans. Finally, we also propose the first study of cancer survival in WTC rescue/recovery workers with cancer.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MDD is one of the most severe and debilitating illnesses that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Despite considerable advances over the past decades, a clear understanding of the etiology of MDD is still lacking. Accumulating evidence suggests that MDD may arise from impairments in cellular cascades, which lead to aberrant information processing in the circuits that regulate mood, cognition, and neurovegetative functions. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as an important class of small non-coding RNAs that by binding to 3' UTR of mRNAs, suppress the translation and/or stability of specific mRNA targets. Since miRNAs show a highly regulated expression, they contribute in the development and maintenance of a specific transcriptome and thus have the unique ability to influence physiological and disease phenotypes. Our recent studies show that the expression of a group of miRNAs is altered in PFC of MDD subjects and that they are involved in coping response to stress. In addition, accumulative evidence points to the involvement of miRNAs in neural plasticity. These studies suggest a strong possibility that miRNAs may contribute significantly to the etiopathogenesis of MDD. We hypothesize that subsets of miRNAs and their variants, regulated in a coordinated fashion, will show differential co-expression in MDD brain, which by affecting specific neural/synaptic mRNA targets and cellular pathways, will participate in MDD pathogenesis. In well characterized postmortem brain samples obtained from MDD and control subjects, we propose to: 1) profile miRNA expression by small RNA sequencing, identify novel miRNAs, and analyze differentially expressed miRNAs; 2) profile mRNA expression by RNA sequencing and identify regulatory relationships between mRNA and miRNA by mapping co-expression network modules; 3) analyze miRNA-mRNA pairs, validate altered miRNAs and specific target genes experimentally, and localize these changes at the cellular level; 4) analyze pathway associated with differentially co-expressed modules in MDD; 5) examine miRNA biogenesis by determining pri-/pre-miRNAs, RISC complexes, and components of biogenesis machinery; and 6) examine the role of synaptic miRNAs in MDD pathogenesis by determining miRNA enrichment via small RNA sequencing in synaptosomes, analyzing target genes and co-expression modules of miRNA-mRNA specifically altered in the synaptic fraction, and examining pri-/pre-miRNAs and components of miRNA biogenesis machinery at synaptic level. By using a combination of the state-of-the-art high throughput small RNA and RNA sequencing, analyzing data by novel bioinformatics tools and validation, identifying changes in miRNAs and their targets in specific cell type(s), and examining the role of miRNAs at the synaptic level in brain regions implicated in mood and cognition, our proposed study is uniquely positioned to advance the field of MDD research at the molecular level. These investigations will provide novel avenues for the development of miRNAs as ''molecular tools'' with the potential to generate new molecular-based therapies to treat this devastating disorder.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY Although the health benefits of physical activity in prevention and mitigation of many chronic diseases have been documented for decades, the molecular mechanisms mediating these health benefits are still poorly understood. To understand the adaptive response of physical activity at the molecular level, it is essential to comprehensively characterize the dynamic changes in protein expression and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in tissues and circulating biofluids. The overall objective of the PNNL Proteomics Chemical Analysis Center for MoTrPAC (ProMoTr) is to support the consortium by providing comprehensive discovery and subsequent targeted verification analyses of circulating protein factors in blood and associated PTMs in multiple tissue types collected by the Pre-clinical Animal Study Sites and Clinical Centers of MoTrPAC. To develop a `molecular map' of transducers that provide the impacts of physical activity in humans, the ProMoTr's integrative proteomics analysis plan has two major foci. First, we will focus on the circulating secreted factors found in blood plasma and tissues based on the known cross-talk between and within tissues resulting from physical activity. Second, we will investigate the tissue- and cellular- level response to physical activity by assessing intracellular signaling as mediated by protein PTMs, including protein phosphorylation, reversible redox modifications, and lysine acetylation and acylation. The Specific Aims of ProMoTr are: 1) to provide the Proteomics Chemical Analysis Element to discover and verify circulating factors and intracellular molecular transducers; 2) to provide the Bioinformatics Element to fully support the needs of ProMoTr in statistical design, data processing, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination; 3) to provide the Administrative Element to oversee internal activities and to provide high-level collaborative interactions with MoTrPAC centers and the broader consortium. The feasibility of performing high quality reproducible discovery and verification analyses on the scale of tens of thousands of tissue samples is built upon PNNL's record of accomplishment of large-scale integrative proteomics programs. The PNNL foundation includes refined quality control, large-scale computation, and dissemination capabilities, our recognized expertise in the development and deployment of cutting-edge mass spectrometry-based technologies, and our capabilities for studying protein PTMs that are closely linked with energy metabolism.\",\n",
       " \"Abstract Many neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability start early in life and often contribute to a lifetime disability. The rising incidence of these disorders is expected to cause a major public health challenge in the coming decades. Despite the impending challenge, drug development for these disorders is facing a crisis; most major pharmaceutical companies have reduced their investment in psychiatric drug development because of a high failure rate. Limitations associated with animal models and a dearth of druggable biological targets, coupled with poor access to the living human brain for dynamic observation and experimentation all conspire to impose an enormous challenge of finding effective psychiatric drugs. Recent advances in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) have made it possible to create a patient-specific brain-like neural tissue (referred to as `cerebral organoid') that displays an architecture and neural network activity resembling that of human tissue. These cerebral organoids (CO) offer researchers an exciting opportunity to investigate disease mechanisms responsible for the development of neuropsychiatric disorders in humans. We propose in this project to link CO with a tissue-engineered blood vessel (BV) and their blood-brain barrier (BBB) interface to form a cerebral microphysiological system (CMPS). There is documented anatomical parallelism between vessel and nerve patterning and development, and it has also emerged that neuron and vessel specification, growth, navigation, and survival share many molecular pathways. The same signaling pathways also play a critical role in the crosstalk between nerves and vessels during the injury repair process in adult brain. Therefore, it is important to understand the interactions between the CNS and the vascular system under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We propose to use two well-defined genetic lesions, the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS or DiGeorge syndrome) and the Proteus syndrome, that affect both the CNS and vascular systems for the development and validation of CMPS. The proposed CMPS, if successful, will offer a powerful platform to screen neuropsychiatric drugs as well as to develop novel neuropsychiatric treatment strategies that target the shared mechanisms between the CNS and the vascular system. !\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minorities continue to be underrepresented in biomedical PhD programs and, thus, the biomedical workface does not reflect the diversity of our nation. Rush University will contribute to the training of underrepresented minority PhD students in biomedical sciences by establishing a new Rush Initiative to Maximize Student Performance (IMSD). We recognize that success in the modern age of biomedical research involves two important arms, one is classical training of graduate students to be productive scientists and the other is the development of professional tools that are increasingly relevant to navigate a rigorous PhD program and one's career thereafter. Towards this end, the Rush IMSD will integrate scientific and professional training activities to ensure that Rush IMSD participant will be fully prepared to complete the PhD program and enter the biomedical workforce. Specifically, we will: 1) Establish training activities to secure key tools necessary to develop ino a productive PhD student and a scientist, including training modules on how to choose a dissertation research advisor (mentor), utilization of helpful research tools, grant writing and review, poster and oral presentations, and education in challenges that face minorities in science, and 2) Establish training activities to support the professional development of Rush IMSD participants and provide them with coping skills to manage the demands of a PhD program and a career in science. These professional skills will be provided through interactive training modules in several areas such as conflict resolution, time management, verbal and respectful non-verbal communication, emotional intelligence, personal financial budgeting and fiscal responsibility of running a lab, exposure to career opportunities in biomedical research, and interviewing skills. Rush IMSD participants will be monitored by an IMSD-student advisory committee, which will ensure their continued success and devise intervention plans. The Rush IMSD program will be steered by internal and external advisory committees. The program will be evaluated by an outside group through a well- integrated process to track, report, and assess long-term outcomes of Rush IMSD trainees. Strength of the Rush IMSD will be a smaller university setting that can facilitate meaningful interactions between faculty and IMSD participants, yet nationally recognized leaders in their respective fields who have a strong record of teaching and mentorships. Collectively, we anticipate that these efforts will increase enrollment of minority PhD students at Rush, support their education and professional development, and that the Rush IMSD instituted model for graduate student training will evolve into a platform that has university sustainability and partnerships.\",\n",
       " 'Idiosyncratic, drug-induced liver injury (IDILI) causes morbidity and mortality in affected patients and necessitates the withdrawal of otherwise efficacious drugs from the market. There is a need for more effective preclinical screening of drug candidates to avoid developing and marketing drugs with IDILI liability. Although mechanisms underlying IDILI reactions are not fully understood, available evidence suggests that adaptive or innate immune responses are involved. A role for cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) has been proposed. Published studies as well as our preliminary results suggest that drugs that cause IDILI in humans sensitize hepatocytes to killing by this cytokine in vitro. Accordingly, the overall hypothesis to be tested is that the abilities of drugs to sensitize hepatocytes to injurious effects of TNF can classify them according to their potential to cause IDILI. In preliminary studies, we exposed HepG2 cells to noncytotoxic concentrations of 24 drugs having either high or no/low IDILI liability in humans. The cells were coexposed to TNF at a concentration that was by itself noncytotoxic. Almost all of the drugs with IDILI liability became cytotoxic in the presence of TNF. In contrast, drugs without IDILI liability showed no such response. Detailed drug concentration-response curves were generated in the absence and presence of TNF, and curve characteristics (EC50s, maximal responses, etc.) were used singly or in combination as covariates to develop statistical classification models. Several models showed superb ability to classify the 24 drugs according to their IDILI liabilities, some yielding areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of > 0.95, indicating remarkably high sensitivity and specificity. This approach has numerous qualities that make it attractive for screening new drug candidates; however, it requires validation and refinement before it would be acceptable as an assay for IDILI prediction in a preclinical, drug development setting. Accordingly, the aim of this proposal is strictly focused to validate and refine promising statistical classification models for development as assays that predict IDILI potential of drug candidates. We will begin by adapting this in vitro approach to a high throughput format. Next, using a larger set of drugs, detailed concentration-response curves obtained in the absence and presence of TNF will provide covariates for evaluating (ie, validating) the most promising of the statistical classification models that resulted from our preliminary study. Finally, the results will be used to refine the models and to select one or more with extraordinarily high performance. Results from the proposed studies have the potential to lead to a robust yet simple, high-throughput, in vitro assay capable of markedly improving preclinical strategies for identifying drug candidates with IDILI potential.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging and stress responses are tightly linked~ indeed, most interventions that extend lifespan appear to do so at least in part through potentiation of stress responses. Nevertheless, the genetic and mechanistic basis of this central relationship remains poorly understood. Here we will test the hypothesis that microRNAs (miRNAs) coordinate stress-responsive pathways in response to lifespan-prolonging interventions. We propose the following: To identify critical new miRNAs that link stress responses to aging in C. elegans, we profiled expression of small RNAs during development, aging and in stressed conditions (heat shock, starvation, hypoxia and oxidative stress). Since miRNAs that are differentially regulated during stress are likely to be mechanistic regulators of the stress response, we propose to characterize ten of the most differentially expressed miRNAs and determine their position in the gene-regulatory architecture of stress responses. We will also integrate our previous profiling and functional analyses of aging-associated miRNAs with these results to identify miRNAs that are associated with both stress and aging and test whether these genes provide mechanistic links between these conditions. To investigate network-level roles of microRNAs in regulation of stress and aging, we propose to elucidate the underlying regulatory network of genes and miRNAs involved in aging and stress. In order to identify critical new sets of miRNAs and pathways that link these processes, we have integrated transcription-factor binding site information, with miRNA target predictions to build a preliminary interaction network of the known regulatory relationships between transcription factors, aging- associated miRNAs, and miRNA biogenesis genes. We also propose to determine targets of key miRNAs biochemically via CLIP-seq and RNA-seq in the presence and absence of the miRNA. These data will allow us to improve the known miRNA-mRNA regulatory interaction network. Then, using this network, we will find miRNAs that comprise feedback loops and highly connected interaction nodes. We will test whether these highly connected miRNAs play critical roles in aging, stress responses, or in integrating the two. To identify miRNA mediators of lifespan extension due to dietary restriction. Our preliminary data point to miR-71 and miR-228 as key network nodes connected to pha-4 and skn-1, transcription factors critical for the response to dietary restriction and other stressors. We will characterize the roles of thes miRNAs and use our gene- regulatory network to identify other such candidate miRNAs. We also propose to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in dietary restriction via deep sequencing and include these in our network analysis above. We are uniquely well situated to carry out this work, as the Slack lab combines extensive experience in miRNAs and aging biology with leading expertise in genome-wide small-RNA characterization. MiRNA analogues and antagonists are pharmacologically tractable~ thus identifying critical aging and stress responsive miRNAs in C.  elegans may lead directly to lifespan and healthspan-prolonging interventions in humans.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary/Abstract We are in the midst of an unprecedented epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The proportion of the population with T2DM has doubled in just one generation. Although the epidemic is primarily driven by obesity, only ~20% of obese individuals develop T2DM. Genetic factors play a major role in determining who among obese individuals will progress to develop T2DM. The heritability of T2DM has been estimated to be approximately 0.5. Genetic studies in humans have identified many loci that contribute to diabetes susceptibility. Nearly all of these loci are involved in ?-cell biology. However, these loci only account for a small part of the high heritability of T2DM. A guiding premise of this grant proposal is that an important source of the missing heritability of human diabetes genetics is the inabiliy to carry out in-depth mechanistic phenotyping of beta-cell function. Here, we propose to carry out deep phenotyping of pancreatic islets to identify genes and pathways that confer susceptibility to T2DM. The project involves a hybrid strategy, employing two complementary mouse genetic cohorts: 1) a population of outbred mice and 2) a panel of recombinant inbred (RI) strains, both derived from the same founder population. This population, The Collaborative Cross, was derived from eight founder strains that together capture a major part of the genetic variability available in inbred mouse strains. Our preliminary studies of the founder strains revealed a high degree of phenotypic diversity in traits related to diabetes susceptibility. These results predict that the traits we propose to study will have strong heritability. Our team consist of a laboratory with extensive experience in islet biology and diabetes genetics together with four statistical geneticists who have developed many of the widely used methods for QTL mapping and causal network construction. We will carry out studies of insulin secretion, beta-cell proliferation and oxidative metabolism. In addition, we will conduct transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic studies on isolated pancreatic islets. In addition to classical association mapping, we will use genetic association data to construct causal networks linking gene loci with intermediate traits and disease phenotypes. Based on our prior experience with successful positional cloning projects, we predict that the loci we identify will be highly relevan to diabetes susceptibility in humans.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuro-inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that causes demyelination and axonal damage. Current therapies available to MS patients are sub-optimal, and there is no cure for this chronic, debilitating disease. B cell depletion therapies have shown promise in several treatment trials, yet B cells can also play protective and anti-inflammatory roles that are important during health and disease. Determining the mechanisms by which B cell antigen presentation mediates neuroinflammation and tolerance in MS is crucial for developing immunomodulatory therapies targeted to encephalitogenic B cell functions. Using an in vivo conditional MHCII expression system and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), our lab has demonstrated that B cells are not sufficient antigen presenting cells (APCs) for passive EAE induced by adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic CD4 T cells unless enough B cells recognize the cognate antigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Further experiments have supported our hypothesis that MOG-specific, membrane bound B cell receptor, rather than MOG-specific secreted immunoglobulin, is critical to the propagation of CD4 T cell auto-reactivity, likely for efficient capture of target antigen. These findings highlight the importance of soluble antibody independent B cell functions to MS pathogenesis. In Aim 1 I will determine restrictions on the location of B cell antigen presentation by quantifying B cell localization and MHCII expression in the CNS compartment. I will also assay murine cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of intrathecal immunoglobulin indicative of B:T cell cognate interactions within the CNS. Lastly, the capacities of non-specific and antigen-specific B cells from passive EAE mice to traverse an in vitro blood brain barrier model will be tested. In Aim 2 I will define the effect of antigen-specifc B cells on CD4 T cell lineage fate during EAE. T cell cytokine production will be determined in antigen recall assays using naÃ¯ve and in vitro- primed splenocytes from WT mice and mice with conditional expression in various APC subsets. Additionally, I will define the cytokine expression profile of B cells from different B-cell dependent EAE models and quantify B cell expression of IL-1?. The hypothesis that B cells shape T cell lineage plasticity will be tested by modulating th timing of B cell antigen presentation in passive EAE in conjunction with dendritic cell MHCII expression. Successful completion of the research proposed in these aims will increase our understanding of cellular mechanisms of inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the CNS. We will identify where important pathogenic functions of B cells occur in EAE and distinguish mechanisms of pathogenic cytokine generation as potential targets for immunotherapy in MS.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The proposed Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) includes the establishment of the Bone Histology and Imaging Core (Core C). The scientific theme of the proposed CMDR is the identification of the molecular causes of diseases and conditions that negatively impact the musculoskeletal system or interact with this system as part of their disease process. The Bone Histology and Imaging Core is consistent with this theme in that it will deliver to the Project Leaders state-of-the-art quantitative tissue and cellular data for the characterization of the structural, tissue, and cellular changes that underlie the pathological mechanisms of the musculoskeletal diseases being studied. The Bone Histology and Imaging Core will therefore be a critical component for the success of the Project Leaders. The Core will consolidate existing equipment on the UAMS campus into a large, modern research space within the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and will hire experienced personnel on the campus, which will be supervised by a Core Leader. The specific aims are: 1) To establish the Bone Histology and Imaging Core; 2) To deliver state-of-the-art musculoskeletal imaging, biomechanical testing, and histology services and introduce new analytical technologies to CMDR Project Leaders and faculty; 3) To provide bone histomorphometry training and support educational activities. The success of the Bone Histology and Imaging Core, in conjunction with the other CMDR cores, will support the development of a critical mass of investigators that will ensure the long-term sustainability and productivity of the Center.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lipid peroxidation leads to the formation of oxidation specific epitopes (OSEs) that are proinflammatory and, unless they are removed, cause extensive cell damage. OSEs are present in oxidized low density lipoproteins (OxLDLs) and on the surface of apoptotic cells and cleared by binding to scavenger receptors (SRs) on macrophages. Persistence and/or excessive amounts of OSEs overwhelm the defense mechanisms against them. Additionally, the inflammatory response initiated by SR activation leads to tissue damage that becomes pathogenic in several diseases, including atherosclerosis. Natural antibodies (nAbs) produced by B1 cells of the innate immune system recognize OSEs and block their adverse effects. Epidemiologic evidence in humans as well as mechanistic studies in mice indicate that the OSE-rich OxLDLs are a pathogenic factor in both atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. Phosphocholine in oxidized phospholipids (PC-OxPL) forms OSEs that are recognized by several SRs including ScrB1 and by the nAb E06 IgM. Transgenic mice expressing a single chain (scFv) form of the antigen-binding domain of E06 IgM (E06-scFv) are protected against atherosclerosis induced by high fat diet (HFD) because the transgene prevents the binding of OSEs to macrophages and activation of inflammatory pathways. We have found that transgenic mice expressing E06-scFv have increased trabecular bone mass, accompanied by an increase in bone formation rate. The E06-scFv transgene also prevents the cortical bone loss caused by HFD by increasing endosteal osteoblast number and bone formation. E06 IgM prevents the negative effects of OxLDL on proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cultured osteoblastic cells. Our findings suggest that anti-OSE antibodies promote bone anabolism by preventing the negative effects of OSEs on osteoblasts and bone formation. Moreover, the level of anti-PC IgM (which includes E06) declines with age in mice, in association with a decline in bone mass. We hypothesize that increased production of OSEs due to accelerated apoptosis, oxidative stress, or chronic inflammation, in concert with inadequate levels of anti-OSE antibodies, contributes to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Studies proposed in this application will establish the cellular mechanisms of the bone anabolic effect of the E06-scFv transgene using DXA, microCT, histomorphometry, and measurement of inflammatory cytokines. Changes in the number and characteristics of osteoclast and osteoblast progenitors will be analyzed, in part by use of a novel FACS approach to study fluorescently labeled osteoprogenitors. The mechanisms by which the E06-scFv transgene attenuates HFD- induced bone loss will be further explored and the ability of this transgene to prevent the bone loss caused by old age will be determined. In addition, we will investigate whether OSEs negatively affect osteoblasts by binding to ScrB1, the most abundant SR for PC-OxPL in osteoblasts. Successful completion of this work should elucidate a previously unappreciated role of OSEs and anti-OSE antibodies in bone homeostasis and may suggest a novel therapeutic approach for the management of osteoporosis and atherosclerosis simultaneously.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Unbalanced bone remodeling often causes bone loss and leads to osteoporosis. Wnt/?-catenin signaling is essential for commitment and differentiation of bone forming osteoblasts from mesenchymal progenitors. Changes in mechanical loading can also influence bone formation. Osteocytes, former osteoblasts buried in bone matrix, are thought to be the cells that perceive mechanical signals and orchestrate bone remodeling. However, the molecular mechanisms by which osteocytes perceive and transduce mechanical signals are not fully understood. YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif), two related transcriptional co-factors that shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, have emerged as potentially important transcriptional regulators in mechanotransduction. Their activity is dependent on their subcellular localization, which is tightly regulated by different extracellular cues. Cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ promote proteosomal degradation of ?-catenin and thereby inhibit Wnt signaling. Mechanical signals emanating from rigid extracellular matrix or from fluid flow promote YAP and TAZ translocation into nucleus where they stimulate transcription. Our preliminary studies show that deletion of YAP and TAZ from osteoblast progenitors increased osteoblast formation in mice, and this was associated with increased Wnt signaling. In contrast, deletion of YAP and TAZ from differentiated osteoblasts and osteocytes decreased osteoblast number and bone formation. These results suggest that YAP and TAZ perform different functions in mesenchymal progenitors versus mature osteoblasts and osteocytes. Based on this, we hypothesize that the less rigid environment of osteoblast progenitors retains YAP and TAZ in the cytoplasm, promotes ?-catenin degradation, and thereby inhibits osteoblast differentiation. In contrast, the more rigid environment of osteoblasts and osteocytes, together with other mechanical inputs (such as fluid shear), favors nuclear retention of YAP and TAZ and thereby increases osteoblast number. To test this hypothesis, we will determine whether YAP and TAZ in osteoblast progenitors inhibit their differentiation by promoting ?-catenin degradation using genetically modified mice in which YAP will be restricted to the cytoplasm or the nucleus (Aim 1). In addition, we will examine whether YAP and TAZ expression in osteocytes mediates the effects of changes in mechanical loading on osteoblast number using tail suspension and cyclic compression models (Aim 2). Further, we will perform in vitro studies to identify YAP and TAZ target genes in osteoblasts and osteocytes that are responsible for their effects on osteoblast number using genome-wide mRNA expression analysis (RNA-seq) in osteoblastic and osteocytic cells before and after suppression of the endogenous YAP and TAZ genes (Aim 3). Successful completion of these studies will shed light on novel mechanisms that control bone formation and will advance knowledge of how the skeleton responds to changes in mechanical load.',\n",
       " \"  There is strong junior investigator interest and senior investigator expertise in cellular transport physiology at Marshall University's School of Medicine (MUSOM). Many of the innumerable health disparities of West Virginia/Central Appalachia (WV/CA) have their roots in widespread obesity, which is epidemic in the region. At the epicenter of these disparities, MUSOM is well positioned to address this. Thus, the overall goal of this new Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) application is to promote cellular transport physiology research in obesity related diseases by the next generation of biomedical investigators and to enhance the necessary infrastructure to accomplish this at the MUSOM. The Appalachian Center for Cellular transport in Obesity Related Disorders (ACCORD) will serve as the academic home for this COBRE. It will leverage existing resources such as the WV IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (WV-INBRE), excellent core facilities, and new institutional resources to train the junior investigators. Every COBRE project is hypothesis-driven; with each addressing a novel cellular transport alteration in a distinct obesity related condition, and each utilizing innovative complementary state of the art experimental approaches. A comprehensive and interactive mentoring plan with attention to the individualized needs of each junior investigator, and outstanding senior investigators as mentors, that is evaluation driven will train the junior investigators to become independent scientists. Novel hands-on mentoring and networking opportunities will further enhance the training of junior investigators. In order to sustain these many training opportunities, while addressing one of the most prevalent diseases, obesity, at the heart of many health disparities in WV/CA and nationwide, new resources (space, funding and faculty positions) have been committed to ACCORD by the institution. In turn, ACCORD, to enhance institutional cellular transport in obesity related disorders biomedical research capacity, will develop new resources as future Cores (e.g. Biostatistics and Study Design and Mentoring and Workforce Development preCores) and provide pilot funding. This ACCORD COBRE proposal is critical for WV/CA, as it focuses on a highly significant and extremely timely research problem. It is innovative because it studies cellular transport abnormalities in obesity related diseases, unique from any other COBRE. Thus, the novel projects of this COBRE will likely identify novel targets that can potentially be modeled as new therapeutics to ameliorate and/or prevent obesity related disorders not only in WV/CA, but across the country.\",\n",
       " 'Obesity and hypertension (HTN) have additive effects in increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death in the developed world. Obese individuals commonly have HTN, and obesity appears to be an important cause of treatment-resistant HTN. Oxidative stress and impaired renal Na excretion are strongly associated with obesity induced HTN. Nevertheless, it is not completely known how oxidative stress affects renal Na handling and blood pressure (BP). We have demonstrated a novel mechanism by which Na/K- ATPase, serving as an amplifier for reactive oxygen species, regulates renal proximal tubular (PT) Na transport and then blood pressure through Na/K-ATPase signaling. Pilot studies have shown that protein carbonylation, a widely accepted marker for oxidative stress, is pervasive in renal PT Na/K-ATPase in hypertensive and obese mice. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that obesity is complicated by chronic oxidant stress within the kidney. This leads to pervasive carbonylation of the proximal tubular Na/K-ATPase ?1 subunit which impairs proximal tubular Na/K-ATPase-Src-ROS signal transduction and ion transporter redistribution. As a result, animals with such chronic oxidant stress have impaired natriuresis in response to increases in dietary Na and become hypertensive. We will test this hypothesis through both in vitro and in vivo studies. In Aim 1, we will investigate the effect of chronic oxidative stress induced by glucose oxidase on Na/K- ATPase-mediated renal PT Na transport. In Aim 2, we will use diet induced C57BL/6 obese mice and polygenic obese TALLYHO/JngJ mice for covering a broader spectrum of human disease mechanisms. We will test the effect of chronic oxidative stress induced by obesity on Na/K-ATPase signaling-mediated renal Na handling and BP as well as effect of the specific Na/K-ATPase signaling antagonist, pNaKtide, on this process. The novel findings of this study may allow for the identification of new targets for interventions in the clinical treatment of obesity related hypertension. Finally, as COBRE junior investigator I will receive scientific and career mentoring while generating important novel preliminary data to apply for NIH R01 funding to become an independent investigator.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT TITLE: Dietary Restriction, GH/IGF-1 and Mechanisms of Cellular Protection and Regeneration ABSTACT: Age is the major risk factor for many morbidities including cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Biogerontology research is well positioned to help prevent or at least delay these diseases by identifying safe strategies to retard aging so that the degree and type of cellular damage does not reach the threshold leading to disease incidence or progression. Here we propose to bring together two biogerontology laboratories from the University of Southern California School of Gerontology and a laboratory from Harvard University to study the molecular mechanisms linking fasting, fasting mimicking diets and protein restriction to reduced nutrient signaling, the stress resistance signaling network, the mitochondrial peptide humanin, and in turn, cellular protection, regeneration, and healthspan. These studies will contribute to the identification of drugs and dietary interventions to treat as well as prevent multiple diseases by acting on the aging process and on multi-system regeneration and rejuvenation. An important advantage of the dietary interventions being tested is that they are periodic and therefore have the potential to match and possibly surpass the beneficial effects of chronic calorie restriction while minimizing the burden of chronic and extreme diets, but also minimizing adverse effects.  This P01 application consists of 3 major projects, an Animal and Biostatistics Core, and an Administrative Core. Our common goals are to: 1) identify and study novel periodic dietary interventions that promote healthspan without causing adverse effects at old ages; 2) study the mechanisms of fasting mimicking diet- and protein restriction-dependent cellular protection, regeneration and rejuvenation with focus on the hematopoietic and nervous systems; 3) understand the link between dietary interventions, growth pathways and humanin to test the hypothesis that this mitochondrial peptide functions as a healthspan mediator and determine whether it can serve as a fasting/protein restriction mimetic; 4) test the hypothesis that endogenous H2S is a key mediator of the protective effects of dietary interventions including fasting, fasting mimicking diets and protein restriction on resistance to ischemic and genotoxic injury to organs and cells, and study the regulation of cysteine gamma lyase-mediated endogenous H2S production by dietary restriction, growth factors and humanin.  The unique background of each PI and the close collaboration between them has generated and will continue to generate new hypotheses, novel cellular and mouse models, as well as technical and conceptual developments. These advances will undoubtedly accelerate the research progress and support the development of clinical trials to improve human health in ways that could not be achieved by each laboratory performing research independently.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an established precursor of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. To date, liver biopsy remains the only test available to detect the two diagnostic features of NASH: hepatocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation, but it is limited by invasiveness and potential complications. The central hypothesis of this application is that magnetic resonance elastogram (MRE) can discriminate NASH from simple steatosis. The hypothesis is supported by strong preliminary data which show that with novel technological modifications, MRE can isolate imaging parameters that correlate with inflammation and ballooning. A single multiparametric test that combines inflammation and ballooning assessment by MRE, and steatosis measurement by MRI-proton density fat fraction has the potential to provide a comprehensive estimation of the 3 components of histologic NAFLD activity score (NAS) in one setting. The objective of this study is to determine and validate the diagnostic performance of this single multiparametric test (henceforth named Hepatogram) for the detection of NASH in human subjects. We will test the central hypothesis in 3 AIMs. In AIM 1 we will use a cohort of obese subjects scheduled for bariatric surgery to assess NASH histologically by liver biopsy obtained during bariatric surgery and noninvasively before surgery by Hepatogram. The imaging parameters of inflammation, ballooning and steatosis will be used to develop a statistical model to predict histologic NAS score. In AIM 2 we will validate this statistical model in an independent, non-bariatric NAFLD cohort, in whom NASH will be diagnosed by liver biopsy and assessed by Hepatogram. In AIM 3 we will examine the longitudinal diagnostic performance of Hepatogram in the detection of NASH regression after weight-loss interventions. We will reevaluate the bariatric cohort described in Aim 1, one year after bariatric surgery by assessing for NASH regression by Hepatogram and liver biopsy. The predictive performance of the statistical model developed in Aim 1 and validated in Aim 2 will be examined by comparing the predicted MRE-based change in NAS score to the change in histologic NAS. This proposal will apply technically innovative approaches to a large, rigorously characterized population with NAFLD to test the hypothesis that Hepatogram is an accurate imaging biomarker for NASH diagnosis, monitoring and response to interventions. Obviating the impractical need for liver biopsy to diagnose NASH before onset of fibrosis would positively impact the care of NAFLD patients. This work will be performed in an academically nurturing environment within Mayo Clinic. The candidate will be guided by a strong mentorship committee of experts in the areas that the candidate identified for necessary training. The candidate acquired a strong foundation in statistical skills in assessment of disease risk, prognostication and outcomes evaluation during her post- doctoral training. She now proposes to solidify her foundation and acquire a set of new and complementary skills necessary for an independent career in clinical research in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic illnesses worldwide. Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated the comorbidity of these conditions, with longitudinal reports suggesting that obesity is a risk factor for the development of asthma and vice versa. Asthma and obesity have strong genetic components, and twin studies suggest that a potential mechanism explaining the asthma-obesity association is shared genetic predisposition or genetic pleiotropy. However, to date, only a few studies have empirically sought to identify the posited pleiotropic variants. Those studies had limited success in identifying pleiotropic loci and had important methodological constraints, including the use of a candidate-gene approach. Specifically, the candidate-gene approach is limited by our current understanding of the genetic architectures of obesity and asthma and of the mechanistic overlaps between the two diseases. Therefore, our study will search for genetic variants that display pleiotropy for asthma and obesity using a hypothesis-free genome-wide association study approach. Two analytic methods will be employed: (1) a univariate pleiotropy-informed false discovery rate-based framework and (2) a multivariate approach called MultiPhen. Our discovery-phase analyses will utilize existing genotype and phenotype data from the third wave of the Nord-TrÃ˜ndelag Health study (HUNT3). The HUNT3 analytic sample will consist of n=27,712 adults aged 20 years or older [11,285 obese and 1,119 asthmatic cases (of which 639 are both obese and asthmatic), and 15,947 non-asthmatic, normal weight controls]. Genome-wide significant pleiotropic loci identified in HUNT3 will be candidates for replication. Our replication-phase analyses will utilize existing phenotype and whole-exome sequencing data from Dr. Andrew DeWan's FAstGen Study. The FAstGen analytic sample will consist of n=384 adults aged 18 years or older [182 obese and 154 asthmatic cases (of which 81 are both obese and asthmatic) and 129 non- asthmatic, normal weight controls]. In secondary analyses, we will characterize the effects of the candidate pleiotropic loci via mediation analyses. We will also investigate whether the candidate pleiotropic loci are associated with asthma and obesity in children, using data from a subset of HUNT3 subjects who were originally recruited into the first wave of the adolescent component of HUNT (Young-HUNT1) and thus also have phenotype data from adolescence [n=1,202; ages 13-19 years]. Lastly, we will evaluate the performance of our two analytic methods, using replication of pleiotropic signals as a metric of the relative performance of the methods. This will be the first study to investigate pleiotropy for asthma and obesity on a genome-wide scale, using pleiotropy-informed methods and incorporating mediation analyses to characterize pleiotropic effects. Findings from this work will advance our understanding of the mechanistic links between asthma and obesity; provide the first comparison of the performance of our two pleiotropy detection methods using real- world data; and promote specific prevention and treatment efforts for obese asthmatics.\",\n",
       " 'According to NIEHS, ?It is imperative to develop methods to assess the health effects associated with complex exposures in order to minimize their impact on the development of disease.? NIEHS has held several meetings on mixtures, including the 2015 workshop on Statistical Approaches for Assessing Health Effects of Environmental Chemical Mixtures in Epidemiology Studies. Conclusions include the following. 1) An interdisciplinary perspective is needed, including insights from environmental epidemiology, statistics/mathematics, toxicology and exposure science. 2) Mixtures epidemiology has three key goals: a) identify components of a mixture contributing to the outcome; b) examine interactions between the components; c) construct summary measures of exposure where possible. 3) Different methods have different strengths and weaknesses that may be complementary. We propose to build upon three methods that performed well at the 2015 workshop: Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), exposure space smoothing (ESS) and weighted quantile sum regression (WQS). We will develop two complementary methods: 1) BKMR/ESS. We will expand and combine aspects of BKMR and ESS into one method that primarily addresses the first two goals: variable selection and interactions. Crucial aspects of our proposal are i) extension to binary health outcomes, the most common type of outcome data in epidemiology (the 2015 NIEHS workshop examined continuous outcomes); ii) variable selection using the hierarchical structures observed for correlations between exposures; iii) incorporation of toxicological information. 2) Single index model: We will evaluate a generalization of WQS, the single index model (SIM). SIM non-parametrically estimates a one-dimensional smooth function of a weighted sum of exposures. The weighted sum represents a summary measure of exposure (one based on toxicological principles), a third goal of mixtures epidemiology. Following method development, we will test the methods using both synthetic and real world data sets, including the Environment And Reproductive Health (EARTH) cohort study. We will incorporate causal inference tools such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). For example, correlated exposures (co-exposures) are confounders under some DAGs and colliders or intermediate variables under others. This must be taken into account in both generation of synthetic data and proper interpretation of results. The specific aims of this project are as follows: Specific Aim 1: Combine features of BKMR and ESS to produce a method for analyzing epidemiologic data that incorporates toxicological information; can handle continuous, binary and repeated measures outcome data; select important exposure variables; flexibly model and examine interactions; adjust for confounders; is robust to influential points; Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the single index model (SIM) as a method for analyzing epidemiologic mixtures data and generating exposure summary measures; Specific Aim 3: Make benchmark synthetic data and method computer code publicly available. ! 1!',\n",
       " 'Abstract Direct reversion of cancers into normal tissues is an ideal strategy for cancer treatment. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel reprogramming method that uses a conceptually unique strategy to reprogram Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells into ?normal? neurons. Reprogramming and oncogenic transformation are stepwise processes that share many similarities. The tumor suppressor p53 is considered today the most important tumor suppressor protein in humans and it suppresses both reprogramming and oncogenic transformation. p53 is often mutations and inactivation in GBMs. Previously we have demonstrated that the depletion of p53 efficiently reprograms human somatic cells into neurons by regulation of a set of transcription factors and found two kinase inhibitors are sufficient to reprogram GBM cells into progenitors and ?normal? neurons under defined culture condition. In vitro and in vivo tumorigenesis assays showed that these induced neurons lose tumorigenicity. Moreover, induced progenitors are sensitive to radiation treatment and ROCK- mTOR inhibitor reprogramming prevents GBM local recurrence in mice. In the proposed project, we will reprogram various p53 deficient GBM cells into progenitors and ?normal? neurons in vitro and in vivo, and develop a novel strategy to combine reprogramming and conventional therapy (radio- and chemo-therapy) to treat GBM. In Aim 1, we will reprogram p53 deficient GBM cells into neurons by targeting mutant and wild-type p53 GBM cells. In Aim 2, we will develop novel reprogramming-based therapy for p53 deficient GBM xenografts in mice. In Aim 3, we will delineate mechanisms of GBM reprogramming. Thus, these studies will allow us to develop a novel reprogramming therapy for GBM treatment, to understand the reprogramming mechanism and to examine feasibility towards clinical trials.',\n",
       " \"Future-oriented thoughts occupy a prominent position in spontaneous mental activity. They serve an important adaptive function, in that they enable us to represent multiple hypothetical outcomes and act in light of those anticipated outcomes. Although a core feature of PTSD is reliving of past traumatic experiences, the anticipation of future threat plays an important role in maintenance of the disorder. Yet, future thinking has not been systematically evaluated in PTSD. Cognitive neuroscience research has shown that there is considerable overlap between the processes involved in remembering the past and envisioning the future. The well- documented alterations in autobiographical memory in PTSD raise the intriguing possibility of changes in future-oriented cognition in PTSD as well. Nonetheless, because thinking about the future is not simply a mirror image of remembering the past, the study of future thinking in PTSD merits systematic investigation in its own right. The current proposal provides the first comprehensive, theoretically motivated analysis of future thinking in individuals with PTSD. The first part of the proposal assesses the scope of PTSD-associated abnormalities in the simulation and appraisal of positive and negative future events and draws on insights from studies of autobiographical memory in PTSD to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms that may underlie these abnormalities. Further, the neural bases of impairments in future thinking are examined using functional neuroimaging. The second part of the proposal evaluates the implications of alterations in future thinking for decision making by examining how decisions made now are impacted by the way their future outcomes are envisioned in the context of an intertemporal choice task. This section of the proposal also explores the contribution of altered risk assessment and altered valuation of future choices to the observed impairment. The third part of the proposal evaluates the feasibility of enhancing future thinking in PTSD through information- processing manipulations shown to impact future thinking in studies of cognition in healthy individuals. The studies comprising this proposal provide a principled way to gauge the nature of the impairment in future- oriented cognition in PTSD. Further, by uncovering mechanisms responsible for these PTSD-associated abnormalities, this proposal lays the foundation for a theoretically motivated approach to information- processing interventions. Given the important ways in which future thought shapes our emotions, motivations, and actions, understanding future-oriented thought in PTSD has wide-range implications for Veterans' quality of life.  \",\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract  Reducing advanced breast cancer mortality requires urgent development of better drugs and improved therapeutic strategies; however, new drug development is extremely time-consuming and costly. With the explosive growth of large-scale cancer genomic and phenotypic data (e.g., the Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]) and publicly available high-throughput screening data for thousands of small molecules (many of which have already received regulatory approval for at least one medical condition), computational drug repositioning or repurposing holds great potential for precision medicine and may provide tools to significantly improve breast cancer treatment and outcomes.  Our hypothesis is that optimal therapeutic choices can be identified for hard to treat breast cancers by applying transcriptome-based drug sensitivity prediction methods. Our long term goal is to identify and validate the efficacy of existing drugs in hard to treat breast cancers, namely triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Toward this goal, this proposal contains two specific aims to develop, apply, and improve methods to predict drug sensitivity (either as a single agent or in combination). We will also validate these predictions in additional large-scale cancer genomic datasets and translate the results using cell based and in vivo (mouse) models of TNBC and MBC. In Aim 1, we will focus on identifying effective drugs as monotherapy, while Aim 2 is to identify and validate optimal therapeutic combinations.  Our study is significant because it will accelerate the development of novel therapies for hard to treat breast cancers by repurposing existing drugs, thus avoiding the lengthy and risky new drug development process. The ability to tailor therapy for specific disease subtypes and identification and validation of new drug indications will provide valuable therapeutic options in the battle against TNBC and MBC, and subsequently reduce their associated mortality. Our proposed research is innovative in both the methodologies employed and their applications, as our transcriptome-based drug sensitivity prediction represents a paradigms shift in drug sensitivity prediction; furthermore, we are applying these novel prediction approaches to patient tumor data not only for biomarker discovery in order to tailor individual therapy, but also for drug repurposing. The ability to bring biomarker discovery and drug repurposing together will present a new opportunity for cancer therapy, as the whole genome expression profile of a tumor will be used to provide optimal therapeutic options in different cancers, and many ?old? drugs can find a new purpose in improving cancer treatment outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Epigenetic regulatory pathways governing gene expression are intimately involved in the regulation of early heart development and cardiac remodeling under pathological stress. Disrupting the cardiac transcriptional networks during early heart development and cardiac regeneration may lead to heart diseases. Among all the known epigenomic modifiers, the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) protein family is a relatively new member found to mediate the reversal of DNA methylation in the mammalian genome. The TET dioxygenases (TET1-3) are capable of converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5hmC) and further oxidized species, thereby promoting active DNA demethylation. The dynamic changes in 5mC/ 5hmC distributions and transcriptional reprogramming play vital roles during early CM development, a critical period that also provides an optimal time window to study fundamental epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that govern cardiac gene transcription. Our own preliminary studies revealed that genetic depletion of Tet proteins in mice impaired early cardiomyocyte (CM) development. At the cellular level, Tet-deficient CMs further exhibited reduced proliferation and metabolic dysfunction. At the molecular level, upon Tet deletion, we observed massive changes in DNA methylation and a disorganized chromatin architecture that might account for disrupted cardiac transcriptional networks and abnormal expression of key metabolic genes involved in proliferation, glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in CMs. We hypothesize that the Tet-mediated DNA demethylation pathway is critical for maintaining proper chromatin accessibility and chromatin looping, thereby regulating transcriptional programming to instruct CM development. The immediate availability of a cardiac-specific Tet triple knockout mouse model, as well as a set of innovative tools developed for precise mapping and editing of DNA modifications, has placed us in an extremely competitive position to unravel novel epigenetic regulatory mechanisms controlling CM development. In Aim 1, we will define how Tet/5hmC regulate chromatin accessibility and the binding of key transcriptional factors to their targets to program essential transcriptional outputs and maintain proper CM development. In Aim 2, we will examine how Tet/5hmC regulate chromatin looping by interplaying with enhancer and insulator elements at critical genomic loci to control metabolic gene expression during CM development. Upon completion of our proposed studies, we anticipate to establish a new paradigm by introducing a previously underappreciated dimension in the epigenetic regulation of the cardiovascular system. Findings from our proposed studies will also provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiac gene transcription and heart development, thereby forming a solid basis for developing potential epigenetic therapies to prevent and treat congenital heart diseases.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT The objective of the present grant proposal is to demonstrate how inborn gene mutations can sensitize the pancreas to alcohol-induced injury and result in alcoholic pancreatitis. The specific hypothesis tested posits that alcohol and mutations that affect digestive enzyme folding synergize in promoting endoplasmic reticulum stress and causing progressive acinar cell damage. In this setting, the pancreas becomes more sensitive to insults and responds with acute attacks of inflammation (alcoholic acute pancreatitis) which eventually progress to chronic disease (alcoholic chronic pancreatitis). Our proposed studies will take advantage of a novel genetically engineered mouse strain, which carries a ?misfolding? mutation in the mouse carboxypeptidase A1 (Cpa1) gene. We will study how in this strain an alcohol diet affects spontaneous pancreatic damage, ER stress markers, cell death pathways and pathological responses in experimentally induced acute pancreatitis.',\n",
       " 'We  propose  a  novel  platform  technology  based  on  liposomal  MRI  imaging  agents  that  provide  methodology  for  safe,  facile  vascular  and  molecular  imaging  of  the  placenta.  We  focus  in  this  application  on  Morbidly  Adherent  Placenta  (MAP:  classified  as  placenta  accreta,  increta  or  percreta),  and  will  demonstrate  the  power  of  this  technology  for  the  study  of  this  condition,  noting  that  the  technology  once  developed  will  be  applicable  to  numerous  other  placental  conditions.  Diagnosis  of  MAP  remains  challenging,  even  with  ultrasound  followed  by  MRI  in  indeterminate  cases:  only  about  half  of  the  cases  of  MAP  are  suspected  prior  to  childbirth15.  MAP  results  in  massive  blood  loss  (25%  of  cases),  hysterectomy (70% of cases) and ICU admission (30% of cases), at rates far higher than the non ?MAP population.    The  detection  of  a  ?retroplacental  clear  space?  is  a  marker  of  normal  placentation.  Further,  the  level  of  adrenomedullin and its receptor (the CRCLR/RAMP2 complex) is thought to be an early marker of MAP. The specific aims  of this project are therefore   1.

       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Drug Design Methodologies - Chris Ho, M.D., Ph.D. This SBIR will develop automated software to accurately estimate drug-target binding affinity and selectivity. This capability is crucial to drug discovery, yet remains elusive in all current design tools. Our technology identifies favorable candidates and distinguishes problematic ones that could exhibit side effects due to weak or non-selective, off-target binding. These compounds cause late phase attrition and the extraordinary costs (>$2B) and time (>10 yrs) needed to develop successful drugs. Lifesaving medications are often shelved due to costs and fear of litigation. By de-risking pipelines, we lower costs, and help companies bring more lifesaving treatments to market. Current tools utilize force fields, which are parameterized sets of equations that simulate chemical behavior, to calculate the free energy of receptor binding. However, they all model electrostatic interactions poorly, using simple point charges and Coulomb?s law, which is inadequate. Instead, we utilize the AMOEBA (Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applications) force field developed at Washington University. AMOEBA employs significantly more rigorous models for electrostatics, utilizing polarizable atomic multipoles to represent electrostatic potentials around the molecule. Our preliminary data and published studies have shown that the AMOEBA force field is much more accurate in predicting drug-receptor binding free energies than current force fields. Unfortunately, the published academic protocol for deriving AMOEBA parameters for a desired drug is far too difficult, time consuming, and technical to be commercially viable. As such, our hypothesis is that this procedure can be automated in a software product and executed by non-experts in one person hour (aside from quantum mechanical calculation time) rather than the 40+ person hours currently required by a computational chemist. This is our first specific aim. Our second aim is to develop automated software to then utilize these parameters to calculate binding free energies against the drug?s receptor target. The lower the receptor binding free energy, the higher the binding affinity and potency of the compound. In Phase II we will extend the software?s functionality to optimize drugs by suggesting chemical modifications that will improve binding affinity to their targets. A market size and forecast report by Grand View Research states that the 2017 US molecular modeling and virtual screening software market is about $800M and growing, in spite of current shortcomings. Our primary clients will be drug discovery groups at both pharmaceutical and biotech companies, as our technology is applicable to both small molecules and biologics. Our business model includes commercialization via software licensing, consulting, contract research, and IP evaluation. By developing this tool, we will accelerate drug development pipelines and diminish costs, providing significant benefit to both researchers as well as patients and clinical outcomes.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified cyber-security of medical devices as a high priority, and has taken steps to work with medical device manufactures to address this growing concern. Nokomis proposes to develop an embedded, or standalone device to analyze unintended Radio Frequency (RF) emissions to determine changes in device functionality between normally operating medical devices from those under cyber-attack. The proposed noninvasive analysis device would allow medical professionals, and patients, to rapidly identify cyber-attacks in operating devices in a matter of minutes, increasing the ability to address critical system breaches before harm can be done. The noninvasive RF measurement approach is a significant advantage over any other current mitigation technique, as it relies only on the deviations from normal operational states to identify potential problems. Minimally trained medical professionals, as well as patients with devices at home, would be enabled to use the embedded or standalone device and potentially identify device risks prior to device failure. Nokomis? proposed monitoring device would enable rapid analysis of a widespread array of medical devices for functional capabilities in a noninvasive, and easy to use, system that would provide many benefits to patients and medical professionals. The proposed device will utilize unintended RF emissions that are casually related to electronic functionality on medical devices to distinguish abnormal operating conditions. Using Nokomis? ultra-sensitive sensor, the deviation in spectral content can be automatically detected to allow an alarm for the user to take action to mitigate damage from a cyber-attack. The proposed research in Phase I will focus on (Aim 1) characterizing a specific medical device in normal operational mode as well as in an altered state under cyber-attack. Differences in spectral content will be used to create detection algorithms (Aim 2) that will be tested in a benchtop prototype system to demonstrate cyber-attack detection capabilities (Aim 3). Successful results from this program will advance the mission of the agency to assure the safety of medical devices to protect the security of human patients that require medical care.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY  The long-term objective of this application is to bring a trachea patch to the market to treat tracheal stenosis, or narrowing of the airway, which left untreated is a life-threatening condition that affects both young children and adults. Currently, otolaryngologists have only two major options for treating tracheal stenosis. One is a complex surgical procedure known as slide tracheoplasty that few surgeons in the country are truly qualified to perform. The other is to open the trachea wider and hold it open with a graft of rib cartilage. Both are difficult, time-consuming procedures with potential complications.  We have a U.S. patent application submitted on a trachea patch biomaterial that overcomes the four major technical hurdles required to replace rib cartilage grafting: 1) mechanical integrity, 2) suturable, 3) resorbable, and 4) air-tight. There is currently nothing on the market even remotely resembling the idea of a synthetic patch for tracheal stenosis. While the academic tissue engineering community has focused primarily on regenerating an entire trachea with highly complex strategies, arguably leading to technology in search of an application, we have focused instead on identifying a specific patient indication with an unmet need and designed a technology to fill that void.  Co-inventors Weatherly and Detamore have worked together for a decade, and after preliminary studies in 38 rabbits and 5 sheep, and partnering with Nanofiber Solutions in 2012, together as a team we are at an inflection point where key refinements of the technology are crucial to moving forward to a Phase II SBIR project and then onward to the clinic. The chief hypothesis is that refinement within the device realm will improve airway opening relative to the original device. We have three parallel aims to test in a single in vivo study with rabbits, each testing a different, more specific hypothesis regarding solutions to improve the technology. The Specific Aims are to test the hypotheses that each of the following will improve airway opening: 1) a faster-degrading polymer, 2) a more favorable biomaterial- cell interaction, and 3) an anti-microbial peptide.  Compared to rib cartilage grafting, our trachea patch holds the following advantages: 1) No surgery to remove rib tissue, saving operating room time and cost, and eliminating potential complication/infection and morbidity at the rib site (attractive to patients and insurance companies), 2) Easy to use, as it is ?plug and play? for surgeons who perform rib cartilage grafting (attractive to surgeons), 3) No biologics or drugs are required (attractive to investors for FDA approval). For several reasons, we focus initial clinical translation on the pediatric population with laryngotracheal stenosis. In the simplest terms, our goal is to fix tracheas for kids around the world with narrowed airways to help them survive and breathe normally again.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating syndrome that afflicts more than 300,000 patients in United States alone and has an unacceptably high mortality rate of 35-40%. Currently there are no therapies that address the loss of lung vascular barrier integrity, vascular leakage and alveolar flooding that are critical features of ARDS pathobiology. The PI was the first to demonstrate that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a multifunctional lipid mediator, is an effective therapy for reducing vascular leakage in inflammatory lung injury via ligation of S1P receptor 1 (S1P1), a G-protein-coupled S1P receptor highly expressed in lung vascular endothelial cells (ECs). We demonstrated that S1P1 receptor ligation by S1P or a long-acting phosphonated S1P analogue, TySIPonate, rapidly stimulates a signaling cascade that reorganizes the lung EC cytoskeleton, enhances junctional integrity and decreases lung vascular permeability. Intravenous administration of S1P or TySIPonate reduces murine and canine lung vascular hyper-permeability evoked by ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), bacterial endotoxin (LPS), ischemia/reperfusion, radiation, or traumatic brain death with marked improvement alveolar edema formation. In addition, this STTR team of investigators have demonstrated that lung vascular permeability in ARDS is directly related to excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are key contributors to lung inflammation and injury with a key role for the ROS-generating enzyme, NADPH oxidase (Nox4), a critical mediator of inflammatory lung injury in preclinical models of VILI and ARDS. The goal of this STTR Phase I application is to formulate the ?ReStore Liposome?, an ACE antibody-conjugated liposome that encargoes the combination of TySIPonate and a novel Nox4 small molecule inhibitor (Nox4-smi) (Specific Aim #1). Specific Aim #2 will evaluate in vitro effects of the ReStore Liposome on vascular permeability and ROS generation and Specific Aim #3 will evaluate in vivo effects of the ReStore Liposome in murine preclinical models of ARDS/VILI models of lung injury as a prelude to use as a therapeutic intervention to reduce the morbidity and mortality of ARDS in humans. As there is an acute unmet need for novel therapies against ARDS, the academic (University of Arizona)-private biotech partnership (Restore Therapeutics, LLC) will leverage unparalleled expertise in drug delivery, inflammatory lung injury and ROS biochemistry to reduce both lung vascular permeability and ROS burden to effectively attenuate preclinical and human ARDS pathobiology.',\n",
       " \"7. Project Summary/Abstract Tulane University Crist, Angela Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder that affects 1 in 5,000 individuals. Patients with HHT commonly exhibit misconnections between arteries and veins, called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which can rupture and lead to stroke or death. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms of AVM formation in HHT are poorly understood therefore no therapy has been developed. Our OBJECTIVE is to identify the molecular mechanism of AVM formation using a novel Smad4 inducible, endothelial cell specific knockout (Smad4-iECKO) mouse model. Our preliminary experiments in the murine retina revealed that loss of Smad4 caused 82% of our mice to develop AVMs. Furthermore, these mice exhibited loss of artery-vein (AV) identity, which we anticipate drives AVM formation. We HYPOTHESIZE that loss of Smad4 leads to AVM formation by directly altering AV identity. Using ChIP-seq, we have confirmed that Smad4 binds to many AV specific genes in a venous EC population. We propose to expand this study to include Smad4 binding sites in an arterial EC population. Using this information, we will identify evolutionarily conserved Smad4 binding regions in both EC populations and determine the biologically relevant sites that control AV gene expression. Furthermore, we will provide a comprehensive characterization of AV gene expression in Smad4 mutants and determine if these changes occur before or after AVM formation. This will allow us to assess if changes in AV identity are a cause or effect of AVM development. Overall, we will provide much needed insight into the role of AV identity in HHT pathogenesis. Furthermore, our studies will undoubtedly provide a better understanding of the TGF-Beta family's role in the endothelium by generating a comprehensive list of Smad4 binding sites in endothelial cells. This knowledge will allow researchers to link the TGF-Beta pathway to its respective target genes and will be relevant to other cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, endocarditis, and cardiomyopathy. !\",\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past decade, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) has worked in collaboration with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) towards the goal of increasing state- based occupational health surveillance capacity. A long-term goal of the CSTE Occupational Health Subcommittee is to build, in collaboration with NIOSH, minimum capacity for the surveillance of work-related injuries and illnesses at the state level. The Western States Occupational Network (WestON) meeting convenes state-based occupational health epidemiologists and scientists from 19 western states, NIOSH and OSHA federal partners, and the NIOSH-funded Education and Research Centers (ERCs) and Agricultural Research Centers located in the western states. The overall goal of this meeting is to strengthen state-based occupational epidemiology in the Western region through capacity building and scientific collaboration, including the ongoing surveillance of work-related injuries and diseases, investigation of cases and outbreaks, and dissemination of information for public health prevention. The WestON meeting aligns with several NIOSH NORA Sector and Cross-Sector Program goals, including Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing (AFF); Mining; Oil and Gas Extraction; Health Hazard Evaluation; and Surveillance. The goals within these Sectors are designed to guide research and research-to-practice through 2016, and are achieved through strong involvement of partners and stakeholders throughout the entire research continuum (conceiving, planning, conducting, translating, disseminating and evaluating research). The WestON meeting has presented topics for discussion and analysis and provided opportunities for collaborations among State-based epidemiologists, academic partners from the ERC/Agricultural Centers, and NIOSH scientists. At its core, the overarching goal of the WestON meeting is to engage a crucial set of NIOSH stakeholders (State occupational health programs) towards the NORA goal of translating and disseminating research findings. As such, CSTE seeks five-year funding to continue the WestON meeting from 2016 through 2020. WestON meetings will continue to be co- sponsored by the Mountain and Plains Education and Research Center (MAP ERC) and the NIOSH Western States Division. CSTE is requesting travel funding for participants who would not otherwise have the opportunity to attend the WestON meeting due to lack of funding within their state. The WestON meeting provides a unique opportunity for this group of professionals to meet and address common workplace safety and health issues and to further develop collaborations and partnerships to enhance state-based epidemiology, surveillance and prevention of work-related injuries and illnesses.',\n",
       " 'Although the link between the immune system and the gut microbiome is being increasingly appreciated, the mechanistic links between the microbiome and inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are unclear. Thus, there is a critical need to define mechanisms by which gut bacteria maintain immune homeostasis and thereby affect neuroinflammation. We have recently reported that MS patients have altered gut microbiota compared to healthy controls, with a reduced abundance of certain human gut bacteria (Parabacteroides, Adlercreutzia, and Prevotella) with the ability to metabolize phytoestrogen. Gut bacteria metabolize phytoestrogen into equol which has structural similarity with estrogen, and can regulate immune responses through estrogen receptors and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Our preliminary data showing significantly milder EAE in mice on a phytoestrogen (Isoflavones) containing diet compared to those on a phytoestrogen free diet suggest a critical role of phytoestrogen in modulation of EAE. Additionally, Prevotella histicola, a member of the Prevotella genus, can suppress disease in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a preclinical murine model of MS. However, the importance of phyoestrogen metabolism in P. histicola?mediated disease suppression is unknown. The central hypothesis of the proposed studies is that the human gut commensal P. histicola mediate its disease-protective effect through metabolism of phytoestrogen and subsequent activation of immunoregulatory cells. We will test our central hypothesis using animal model, genetically modified mice, and a cell culture approach in the following two specific aims. In first aim, we will utilize P. histicola as a representative phytoestrogen-metabolizing gut commensal bacteria to determine whether metabolism of phytoestrogen is required for ability of P. histicola to suppress disease and induce Tregs and/or CD103+ Tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs). We will determine the importance of AMPK signaling in the phytoestrogen induced activation of Tregs and/or tolerogenic DCs. In second aim, we will determine whether the phytoestrogen plus bacteria mediate the induction of immunoregulatory cells via estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent pathways in intestinal epithelial cells and/or immune cells. Our study is fit for the ?High Priority Immunology Grant (R01) mechanism because we are proposing to determine the mechanisms underlying the microbial impact on systemic immunity which can be harnessed in designing potential mono as well as combination therapies because drugs with diverse non-overlapping mechanisms might provide maximal benefit to MS patients. We will determine whether phytoestrogen-metabolizing bacteria maintain a disease-free state by tilting the Tregs to Th1/Th17 balance towards Tregs through its interaction with estrogen receptors and the AMPK pathway. We expect the outcome of our study will have a positive impact on development of gut microbial-flora/diet-based therapies for MS as well as other inflammatory autoimmune diseases.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Master of Science in Occupational Health degree - Industrial Hygiene program ((MSOH-IH) was originally founded in 1985 and currently is offered by the Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine in the College of Medicine and Life Sciences at the University of Toledo Health Science Campus. This IH Program has been continuously accredited by the Applied Science Accreditation Commission - Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ASAC-ABET) for full (6- year) cycles since1996; with the last cycle approved for the period 2014-2020. The primary goal of the Program is to provide master-level education and training to full- and part-time graduate students and members of the public for the purpose of increasing their knowledge, comprehension, skills and attitudes essential to the advancement of occupational health and safety science, practice and research. This is accomplished via a combination of theoretical, practical and applied (i.e. case-based; problem-based) classroom, laboratory, and field teaching and research activities. The program educates and trains individuals mainly from Northwest Ohio region. In turn, graduates are employed as occupational health and safety specialists in the region. In addition, the program accepts students from outside the region and several alumni are employed in other areas throughout the USA, Canada, and Middle East countries. The Industrial Hygiene program adopted the ABET definition for Program Educational Objectives, that is, what the program graduates will be qualified to practice at the time of graduation and what most graduates will be able to achieve (e.g. certification; advanced degree; job promotion) a few years after graduation. The three Program Educational Objectives for the MSOH-IH program are: (1) AII graduates are expected to be qualified to practice comprehensive industrial hygiene. (2) Most graduates are expected to practice in the field of Industrial Hygiene or related areas of Environmental and/or Occupational Health and Safety and to meet the relevant and appropriate needs of their employers. (3) When eligible, based on degrees and post-graduate work experience (i.e. 4 years post-graduation), most graduates who pursue applicable certification in occupational health and safety (i.e. CIH; CSP; CHMM) will pass. The program is designed to educate and train 15-20 full-time (FT) or part-time (PT) students (~8 FTE) per year, with funding requested for the FT equivalent of 5 NIOSH trainees per year. Because the applicants to our Program are usually employed full-time and our classes are offered in the evenings and Saturdays, the NIOSH originally allowed us to award the scholarships to both FT and PT students. Since the last round of TPG funding (2009-2014) of the Program by NIOSH/CDC, the program has graduated 25 industrial hygienists (25/5=5/yr); 15 of those (60%; 3/yr), FT or PT, have been awarded scholarship from the funding. The program expects 16-17 IH students to be enrolled in the Program during the Fall semester 2014. As documented in this application, the IH program (a core discipline) at the University of Toledo has filled a critical gap in the Northwest Ohio workforce needs. .',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are among the new mosquito-transmitted infections that have recently emerged in the Americas (including the continental USA) as major health problems. These diseases are co-endemic, share similar initial symptoms, but differ greatly in disease management and in later stage complications ? birth defects for ZIKV and reactive arthritis (long-term arthralgia) for CHIKV. Reliable diagnostic tools for ZIKV, CHIKV, and other mosquito-borne pathogens are vital for appropriate risk management and therapy; to prevent early misdiagnosis that may worsen later consequences; and for tracking virus transmission patterns. Multiplexed diagnostic tools are urgently needed, but not currently available for use at the point of care. Our long-term objective is to develop an inexpensive, rapid, point of care, multiplexed molecular diagnostic platform for the co-detection of a dozen of mosquito-borne pathogens and the detection of co-infections. In this R21, we take the first steps towards such a system by focusing on molecular detection of ZIKV and CHIKV in blood. Our system will accept a raw sample, carry out sample preparation and a new two-stage isothermal-isothermal enzymatic amplification, and report results. Our device can be used in the clinic, doctor office, and at home with minimal instrumentation and (optionally) without electrical power. To enable quantification and surveillance, the system can optionally interface with a smartphone for signal detection, processing, and transmission. The proposed platform is versatile, can be readily modified to address emerging threats, expanded to detect additional targets, and adapted to operate with various clinical specimens.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spina bifida (SB) is a serious birth defect, and is the most common of the neural tube defects (NTDs). The prevalence of SB among children and youth ages 0 to 19 years old in 2002 was 3.1 per 10,000 children (Shin, 2010). This proposal is designed to establish a prospective patient registry of all children with SB who receive care at Seattle Children's Hospital (SCH) Neurodevelopmental (NDV) Clinic. The objectives of this project are: 1) To establish a SB registry at SCH for children and adolescents with SB who receive care at NDV clinic, 2) to identify best practices for the care of children and adolescents with SB, and 3) to identify areas of future research regarding SB. Children ages 0 -22 years who attend NDV clinic or receive inpatient care at SCH, who have an eligible diagnosis of SB, and who plan to return to clinic at least once in the next 12 months will be eligible to participate. Dta will be collected for each participant at one annual visit per year, using data recorded in the hospital electronic and paper medical record. Data analysis will be guided by the registry coordinating committee, and will be to identify best practices for SB care and future improvements to the registry.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY The annual Society for Reproductive Investigation (SRI) meeting brings together both clinical and basic scientists from around the world to discuss research related to women's health and reproductive science. The highly successful annual SRI meeting has had an average attendance of 1164 investigators over the last four years and has brought together established senior and junior investigators to report and discuss their findings in an atmosphere conducive to frank yet amicable exchange. This application seeks funding to cover travel costs to allow 10 trainees and new investigators to attend SRI annual meetings. This proposal also seeks funding to support the travel costs of a senior US-based investigator who will present an invited Distinguished Presidential lecture at the meeting. Meetings are scheduled in March of each year in San Diego, CA (2018), Paris, France (2019), Vancouver, Canada (2020), and Boston, MA (2021). The four-day meeting includes two or three Distinguished Presidential Lectures, oral and poster presentations, 12 mini-symposia, a new investigator plenary, career development and diversity forums, and networking events. The 65th Annual SRI Scientific Meeting, entitled ?Power of Collaboration?, will be held in San Diego, CA, March 7-10. The SRI will continue its efforts to ensure adequate representation of underrepresented minorities (17% in 2017) and women (55% in 2017) as attendees, speakers, and session chairs at each annual meeting.\",\n",
       " 'Tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells are potent mediators of immunity against infectious pathogens in peripheral tissues. Published studies from our laboratory now establish a crucial role for TRM cells in immunity to cancer. We show that immunotherapy-induced CD8 TRM cells mediate immunity to melanoma in the skin, and that autoimmune vitiligo is a key host requirement for generating these durably protective TRM cells. Vitiligo has long been recognized as a positive prognostic factor in melanoma patients. We find that the skin of vitiligo- affected mice provides a hospitable niche for the residence of memory T cells that provide durable, protective, antitumor immunity. We hypothesize that a diverse complement of functional memory T cells in peripheral tissues underlies the durable tumor immunity observed in mice and melanoma patients with vitiligo and other cutaneous inflammatory events. Our first Specific Aim will be to determine the contribution of TRM cells to metastatic tumor protection. Mice with vitiligo also maintain protection against lung metastases, and our preliminary data reveal a distinct population of tumor-specific TRM cells in the lungs of mice with vitiligo. We will test the hypothesis that lung TRM cells and lymphoid TEM cells together prevent metastatic melanoma growth, and define a core transcriptional signature for lung and skin TRM cells. Our second Specific Aim will be to define the tumor antigen specificity of protective TRM recall responses in skin. Our data show that TRM cells in vitiligo- affected skin have specificity for melanocyte/melanoma shared antigens, as well as a model tumor-specific antigen. We will determine how antigen recognition affects T cell function and competition for the TRM niche, and test the hypothesis that TRM cells with specificity for both tumor/self antigens and neoantigens mediate the rejection of melanoma and non-melanoma tumors in the skin. Finally, our third Specific Aim will be to determine the role of antigen-unrelated cutaneous inflammation in promoting TRM responses to melanoma. We will test the hypothesis that melanocyte-unrelated skin inflammation can generate melanoma-specific TRM cells by assessing TRM cell responses in skin biopsies from melanoma patients with vitiligo and other cutaneous inflammatory events. Preclinical work will focus on a therapeutic approach for promoting TRM responses in conjunction with immune checkpoint inhibition. Overall, this project will define the role of resident memory T cells in the immune response to cancer. By demonstrating a fundamental role for TRM cells in host-wide immunity to cancer, these studies are expected to have a transformative impact on the way that immunotherapies are delivered and evaluated.

       " 'The long-term goal of this program is to develop our novel antimicrobial, teixobactin, into a therapeutic for treating a wide range of infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. The goal of this Phase IIB project is to complete preclinical development of teixobactin in preparation for clinical trials.  Using our iChip culturing technology, NovoBiotic has been exploiting previously uncultivable bacteria that make up 99% of all microorganisms for production of secondary metabolites. In 2015, NovoBiotic reported the discovery of teixobactin, the first member of a novel class of peptidoglycan synthesis inhibitors. Although teixobactin showed some favorable drug properties, it was found to gelate in serum or phosphate buffered saline, resulting in sporadic adverse effects in animals. Due to this narrow safety window, we decided to focus on a formulation screening program to prevent or significantly reduce this gelation property to minimize or eliminate the adverse effects. After screening over 800 potential vehicles and vehicle combinations, we developed a new formulation of teixobactin, using an FDA-approved vehicle, which reduces gelation in serum, shows no loss in potency against pathogens, is well tolerated in animals while providing blood levels far exceeding the MIC for several hours, and is highly efficacious in two validated mouse models of infection. The other aims of the Phase IIA grant that were not influenced by the formulation studies were fulfilled, such as improving the teixobactin fermentation yields 10-fold, and studying the postantibiotic effect of the compound.  The goal of this project is to advance the newly-formulated teixobactin through IND-enabling studies in preparation for clinical trials. This will include: (Aim 1) produce enough compound through fermentation to conduct all IND-enabling studies; (Aim 2) perform FDA-recommended in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) and GLP safety pharmacology studies, as well as a murine PK/PD study; (Aim 3) perform non-GLP and GLP toxicity studies in two species; (Aim 4) perform preformulation studies such as determining the stability, solubility and physicochemical properties of teixobactin as part of establishing the Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) parameters. With a successful Phase IIB program, we will have sufficient data to file an IND, and prepare for large-scale manufacturing and clinical trials.',\n",
       " 'Poverty disproportionately impacts minority and rural populations and is very strongly correlated with poor health over the life cycle, and has been hypothesized to lead to a shorter, less healthy aging process. Poverty is associated with a greater burden of disease than smoking and obesity combined and accounts for the bulk of health disparities by race. It is widely believed that an anti-poverty policy?such as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)?could improve healthy aging among working-age low-income adults over the life cycle. It does so by increasing material hardship and psychological stress?two risk factors that are strongly correlated with biological markers of premature aging (e.g., shorter telomeres, higher cholesterol levels, and higher blood pressure.) However, the literature linking poverty to health is largely built on correlational data, which is subject to confounding and reverse causation. The experienced research firm MDRC has secured private and public funding for a groundbreaking multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that examines the causal impacts of quadrupling EITC for working adults without dependent children in Atlanta, GA and New York City, NY called Paycheck Plus (PP). Randomization exposes the treatment group to up to $2000 in PP compared to up to $496 in the control group. However, MDRC is not studying the impacts of PP on health. We propose leveraging MDRC?s existing infrastructure and our long history of collaboration with MDRC to add clinical, survey, and administrative measures to explore whether PP improves the health and survival of adult recipients without dependent children. Timed with launch of the study in Atlanta, we propose in-person health screenings with collection of important biomarkers of chronic disease, such as blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), blood glucose, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein (measures that are conceptually linked to poverty). For both the NYC and Atlanta Cohorts, we propose adding survey data that measures health-related quality of life and depression. Since not everybody randomized to the treatment group will file taxes (a requisite for the treated group to receive PP or the control group to receive traditional EITC), we will analyze our health outcomes using an Intent to Treat (ITT) versus Treatment on the Treated (ToT) analysis. This will produce Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) estimates of the unbiased impact of increased PP on health. In addition, we will collect long-term follow up data on mortality for both treatment sites. We will do so by linking individual identifiers administrative mortality data from the National Death Index. Finally, we will model the health and longevity gains associated with PP relative to traditional EITC. This project is innovative for exploiting a planned and fully funded social science experiment to explore outcome measures that were not originally considered by the policymakers. This project is also innovative for being a RTC of an anti-poverty program that uses administrative and clinical health data at a very low cost. We anticipate that PP will be an efficient approach to promoting healthy aging by lifting adults without dependent children out of poverty.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION: In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, treated HIV-infected adults have a greater risk of non-AIDS related morbidity, which includes cardiovascular disease, neurocognitive disease, osteoporosis, liver disease, kidney disease, and some cancers. Among the factors that contribute to the risk of non-AIDS complications are antiretroviral drug toxicity,a high prevalence of traditional risk factors (such as substance abuse, obesity, and hypertension), and immune dysfunction and inflammation. In fact, illicit drug use remains the second most common mode of exposure to HIV among AIDS cases nationwide, representing 31% of total diagnoses. In addition to drug use as a factor in initial exposure to HIV, ongoing drug use, correlates of the lifestyles associated with drug use, and lack of access and adherence to treatments for drug use and HIV infection are among the related factors that exacerbate disease progression. In particular, the gastrointestinal tract and its resultant loss of barrier function i a major target for acute HIV infection and drugs of abuse, leading to the occurrence of ischemic lesions secondary to inflammation. Thus, negative synergy between HIV infection and drug use impacting intestinal permeability is central to this proposal. Currently the therapeutic focus for the HIV-infected population is on (i) improved antiretroviral compounds, (ii) cure-based strategies directed at the latent viral reservoir, and (iii) anti-inflammatory, probiotic, antibiotc, and anti-coagulation treatments that target systemic immune activation and hypercoagulability. This application outlines an entirely distinct molecular and cellular target for HIV treatment - repairing the intestinal barrier defect. We reason that HIV- and illicit drug-mediated breakdown in the intestinal mucosa leads to chronic exposure to translocated microbial products, which drive systemic inflammation. These subtle elevations in both inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers are associated with dramatic and sustained increases in risk of all-cause morbidity and mortality in HIV. We therefore propose an innovative three-tiered research strategy to alter the conversation in the HIV scientific community, informed by the augmentation in intestinal damage due to the joint insult of HIV infection and use of illicit drugs. (i) We will define in vito the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which mucosal T cell depletion, accompanied by the preferential decrease in IL-17 and IL-22 production, antiretroviral drug toxicity, morphogenetic patterning (by the Wnt, Notch, and hedgehog pathways), enterocyte apoptosis, and lamina propria fibrosis (due to HIV infection) and intestinal ischemic damage (due to drug use) combine to increase intestinal permeability (IP) via a loss in epithelial integrity and homeostasis. (ii) Working in vivo in the SIV primate model, we will test directly the ability of exogenous IL-17 and IL-22 to decrease intestinal permeability, reduce systemic inflammation, and possibly alter the disease course. Finally, (iii) we will test our hypothesis that focusing on epithelial repair is a transformative approach to HIV- and illicit drug-promoted mucosal damage, by initiating a pilot clinical study with human Growth Hormone (hGH) as the therapeutic and a reduction of intestinal permeability, a decline in circulating microbial products, and a decrease in biomarkers of hypercoagulability and inflammation, as the clinical endpoints. We hope to establish a new paradigm in which we expect to identify novel therapeutic strategies to heal the breached epithelium, and subsequently stem the translocation of microbial products, minimize systemic inflammation, and treat the HIV-infected drug user.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An occupational health and safety surveillance program in Montana would work to accomplish three main goals in order to bridge the gap between occupational health surveillance and prevention and safety activities. This program, Montana Occupational Health and Safety Surveillance (MOHSS), would accomplish this through three primary activities that all together can provide valuable information and lead to occupational health improvement across the state. MOHSS will collect, report, and analyze the NIOSH Occupational Health Indicators as a baseline for occupational health surveillance. The indicators collected on an annual basis will allow for an analysis of trends in occupational health These will be used to monitor Montana's occupational safety and health landscape, reveal areas in need of more in-depth surveillance, and guide prevention efforts. MOHSS will also use interagency collaborations to improve the quantity and quality of occupational health data collected and used for occupational health surveillance. MOHSS will work to improve access to and quality of existing systems as well as explore new data sources. In order to accomplish this, MOHSS will collaborate with other agencies and bureaus within Montana to take advantage of the large variety of surveillance systems already in place. These include the MT Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS), DLI Research and Analysis, and other organizations.  Finally, MOHSS will create and maintain active communication with stakeholders in occupational safety and health to provide avenues through which information from MOHSS can reach agencies able to act in the findings. Findings from MOHSS will guide interventions and preventative policy targeting occupational health and safety hazards most efficiently. These relationships will also provide external guidance to MOHSS and provide council on aspects of occupational health of particular importance or concern.\",\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past decade, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) has worked in collaboration with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) towards the goal of increasing state- based occupational health surveillance capacity. A long-term goal of the CSTE Occupational Health Subcommittee is to build, in collaboration with NIOSH, minimum capacity for the surveillance of work-related injuries and illnesses at the state level. The Western States Occupational Network (WestON) meeting convenes state-based occupational health epidemiologists and scientists from 19 western states, NIOSH and OSHA federal partners, and the NIOSH-funded Education and Research Centers (ERCs) and Agricultural Research Centers located in the western states. The overall goal of this meeting is to strengthen state-based occupational epidemiology in the Western region through capacity building and scientific collaboration, including the ongoing surveillance of work-related injuries and diseases, investigation of cases and outbreaks, and dissemination of information for public health prevention. The WestON meeting aligns with several NIOSH NORA Sector and Cross-Sector Program goals, including Agricultural, Forestry and Fishing (AFF); Mining; Oil and Gas Extraction; Health Hazard Evaluation; and Surveillance. The goals within these Sectors are designed to guide research and research-to-practice through 2016, and are achieved through strong involvement of partners and stakeholders throughout the entire research continuum (conceiving, planning, conducting, translating, disseminating and evaluating research). The WestON meeting has presented topics for discussion and analysis and provided opportunities for collaborations among State-based epidemiologists, academic partners from the ERC/Agricultural Centers, and NIOSH scientists. At its core, the overarching goal of the WestON meeting is to engage a crucial set of NIOSH stakeholders (State occupational health programs) towards the NORA goal of translating and disseminating research findings. As such, CSTE seeks five-year funding to continue the WestON meeting from 2016 through 2020. WestON meetings will continue to be co- sponsored by the Mountain and Plains Education and Research Center (MAP ERC) and the NIOSH Western States Division. CSTE is requesting travel funding for participants who would not otherwise have the opportunity to attend the WestON meeting due to lack of funding within their state. The WestON meeting provides a unique opportunity for this group of professionals to meet and address common workplace safety and health issues and to further develop collaborations and partnerships to enhance state-based epidemiology, surveillance and prevention of work-related injuries and illnesses.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability among veterans, and Department of Veterans Affairs health care users are the most severely affected.  There is ample evidence that exercise improves pain, function, and other outcomes among patients with knee OA.  However, the vast majority of individuals with knee OA are physically inactive.  There is clearly a need to develop and implement programs that efficiently and effectively foster regular physical activity and improve key patient-centered outcomes among veterans with knee OA.  The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness a novel STepped Exercise Program for Knee OsteoArthritis (STEP-KOA).  This will be a randomized controlled trial of n=345 veterans with symptomatic knee OA in two VISN 6 sites, with participants assigned to two study arms: STEP-KOA and Arthritis Education Control (AE).  STEP- KOA will begin with three months of access to a low-resource internet-based exercise training program that uses patient-specific information to determine and deliver an appropriate personalized exercise plan (Step 1).  Participants who do not meet response criteria for clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function after three months of Step 1 will additionally receive telephone calls from an  exercise counselor for three months, to facilitate adherence and address barriers to physical activity (Step 2).  Participants who still fail to meet response criteria after Step 2 will receivein-person physical therapy visits, which address specific functional impairments and further tailor exercise recommendations (Step 3).  Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months (primary outcome time point).  Veterans in the AE group will be offered participation in STEP-KOA after completing study assessments.  The primary outcome will be the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), a measure of lower extremity pain, stiffness and function.  The secondary outcomes will be objective measures of physical function.  The main study analyses will compare the STEP-KOA intervention to the AE control condition at follow-up time points.  We will also evaluate patient characteristics associated with the need for progression to each Step and will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of STEP-KOA.  This stepped exercise intervention is matched with patient needs, and it also provides the VA with a potential approach for focusing limited physical therapy resources toward patients who do not respond adequately to initial, less resource intensive and costly strategies to improve physical activity and related outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Military environmental exposures are pervasive in Iraq and Afghanistan, including particulate air pollution levels that are 10 times higher than urban cities in the United States. Although a causal relationship is unclear, respiratory symptoms are frequently reported both during and following deployment, and deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan is associated with an increased risk of respiratory conditions. Despite the presence of symptoms, the majority of Veterans have normal lung volumes and airflows as detected by spirometry. However, spirometry may be insensitive in this population and does not assess the primary function of the lung which is gas-exchange. Gas-exchange is assessed at rest via the measurement of lung diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), and our preliminary data suggest that DLCO is commonly reduced in Veterans despite normal spirometry. The pattern of normal lung volumes and airflows but low DLCO ? i.e., an isolated reduction in DLCO ? suggests early pulmonary vascular or parenchymal lung disease. An isolated reduction in DLCO has previously been reported in exposure-related bronchiolar disorders, including a case series of active duty soldiers with dyspnea on exertion. We hypothesize that exposure to particulate air pollution during deployment results in deposition of small particles in the distal airways, resulting in focal pulmonary vascular injury, release of vasoactive mediators and systemic vascular dysfunction which manifests as respiratory symptoms and dyspnea on exertion. Our aims are: Aim 1) To non-invasively assess resting and exercise gas-exchange as well as the pulmonary hemodynamic response to incremental and maximal exercise, and Aim 2) To identify systemic markers of vascular injury, including circulating levels of vasoactive mediators and systemic vascular reactivity. Pulmonologists in the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense have recognized the biggest challenge in evaluating post-deployment respiratory symptoms is the individual with normal spirometry; therefore, we will focus on this group of post-9/11 Veterans. Specifically, we will recruit two groups of Veterans with normal lung volumes and airflows, but with (Normal PFT) and without reduced DLCO (Low DLCO). By classifying Veterans into groups based on pulmonary function patterns (Normal PFT vs. Low DLCO), we will be able to discern whether an isolated reduction in DLCO is an unusual variant or a harbinger of deployment- related lung disease. To complement our aims, we will conduct exploratory follow-up evaluations (annually over the duration of the award) on a subset of Veterans to determine how pulmonary vascular function and systemic markers of subclinical pulmonary vascular disease progress over time. Through these studies, we expect to uncover new knowledge about deployment-related respiratory disease as well as the short- and long- term consequences of military environmental exposures, which may facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic post-9/11 Veterans.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The liver plays a vital role in maintaining blood glucose levels, in part, through gluconeogenic processes. Gluconeogenesis is an energy costly process that is supported through fat oxidation in hepatic mitochondria. The TCA cycle serves as a hub where acetyl-CoA from the break down of fatty acids and carbohydrates meet for oxidation to CO2 and the production of 3 NADH and 1 FADH2. Not only does the TCA cycle support gluconeogenesis through the formation of reducing equivalents that fuel the electron transport chain, but it also provides gluconeogenic substrates through cataplerotic processes. Changes in substrate concentration and redox state modulate TCA cycle flux and anaplerotic/cataplerotic processes. However, the mechanisms regulating this metabolic response remain to be elucidated. In pathological conditions such as obesity and insulin resistance, TCA cycle flux and gluconeogenesis are elevated, contributing to the inappropriately high endogenous glucose production often observed in insulin resistant individuals. Still, it is no known how the TCA cycle is regulated in this diseased state. Many metabolic processes are sensitive to the energy state, and energy sensors, such as AMPK and Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) may be responsible for coordinating the response of these metabolic processes to changes in energy charge. AMPK is an energy sensor that is activated in response to high AMP:ATP ratios. In response, AMPK stimulates catabolic processes, such as fatty acid oxidation to replenish ATP. Specific Aim 1 will use ex vivo and in vivo experiments, with and without the regulatory capacity of AMPK to determine whether AMPK is responsible for changes in TCA cycle flux and cataplerotic/anaplerotic processes in response to changes in substrate concentration (ex vivo), or in an obese, insulin resistant state (in vivo). It is hypothesized that AMPK will be necessary for increases in TCA cycle flux in response to increases in substrate concentrations and that TCA cycle flux and anaperotic/cataplerotic processes will be elevated in AMPK-KO mice in response to 16 week HFD, but that constitutively active AMPK will restore the flux of these processes. SIRT3 is a mitochondrial deactylase that is activated by changes in the redox state (high NAD+/NADH) and responds by deacetylating mitochondrial proteins involved in metabolic processes. Specific Aim 2 will examine whether SIRT3 regulates the response of TCA cycle flux and cataplerotic/anaplerotic processes to changes in redox state (ex vivo) and in the obese insulin resistant state (in vivo). I hypothesize that SIRT3 will be required for normal TCA cycle flux and anaplerotic/cataplerotic processes. The findings from this research will expand our knowledge of the role of energy sensors, and the function of TCA cycle flux and anaplerotic/cataplerotic processes in both healthy and diseased states. These results may provide future targets for pharmaceutical companies to treat or prevent NAFLD and/or insulin resistance.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is reaching epidemic proportions in Western societies. T2D occurs when the ÃŸ-cells of the pancreas do not secrete enough insulin to properly regulate peripheral blood glucose levels, usually in the face of obesity and associated peripheral insulin resistance. The mechanisms underlying insulin secretion are not properly understood. Using a forward genetics approach, we have discovered that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the protein-coding region of the gene for tomosyn-2 is directly correlated with the hypoinsulinemic/hyperglycemic phenotype. Tomosyn-2 is a relatively uncharacterized protein and the mechanism by which it regulates insulin secretion is not known. The work proposed here in this Pathways to Independence Award application has two primary goals: 1) to elucidate the mechanism by which tomosyn-2 regulates insulin secretion in pancreatic ÃŸ-cells, and 2) to use my development of this novel area of T2D research to facilitate the development of my career from the mentored phase to an independent phase. During the mentored phase of the grant, I will receive training in mass spectrometry, in vitro liposome fusion assays, membrane biochemistry, and the generation of the tomosyn-2 knockout mouse. The research conducted in the mentored phase will examine the effect of identified phosphorylation sites on the ability of tomosyn-2 to regulate insulin secretion and to understand the mechanism by which tomosyn-2 is targeted for proteosomal degradation. During the independent phase of the grant, my research will examine the mechanism by which tomosyn-2 inhibits insulin secretion by regulating the activity of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins and characterize the role of novel tomosyn-2 binding proteins. These studies will provide novel clues to the mechanism by which tomosyn-2 inhibits insulin secretion and will further our understanding of the regulation of insulin secretio in T2D.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients who develop sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) before age 65 (~5% of all AD patients) pose a clinical challenge and a scientific enigma. From a clinical perspective, early-onset (EO) patients often present with primary executive, language or visuospatial symptoms (with relative sparing of memory), and accurate diagnosis is challenging due to overlap with non-AD dementia and non-degenerative conditions. Emerging AD biomarkers could facilitate accurate diagnosis but have rarely been studied in this population. The performance of biomarkers in studies of typical late-onset (LO) AD cannot be generalized to EO patients because of differences in degenerative patterns and reference ranges. From a scientific perspective, EO syndromes show a striking dissociation between amyloid-beta (A?) pathology, which is diffuse and symmetric in all syndromes, and brain degeneration, which parallels symptoms and can be asymmetric or focal. This raises fundamental questions about the mechanisms that drive clinical and anatomic diversity in AD. This proposal applies detailed clinical phenotyping and multi-modal neuroimaging to optimize the diagnosis of EO syndromes, and to study mechanisms of heterogeneity in AD. Leveraging the specialization of the UCSF ADRC in early-onset dementia, the study will include 150 mildly impaired (CDR 0.5-1) EO AD patients, 50 each with a predominant executive/memory, language and visuospatial clinical phenotype, and 40 patients with LO-AD. A positive amyloid (PIB) PET scan will be required for inclusion. Patients will undergo structural MRI, functional connectivity (resting state) MRI (fcMRI), FDG-PET and CSF analysis. Comparative data from matched normal controls (NC) and non-AD dementia patients will be obtained from other ongoing studies. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that neurodegeneration in all AD variants converges in temporoparietal regions that comprise the posterior portion of the default mode network (DMN), a core, selectively vulnerable network in AD. Aim 1 tests the diagnostic applications of this hypothesis by comparing the sensitivity and specificity of temporoparietal versus hippocampal MRI/FDG measures in discriminating EO-AD versus NC and non-AD dementia, and compares the performance of imaging biomarkers in EO vs. LO-AD. Aim 2 applies fcMRI to test the hypothesis that the posterior DMN is affected across EO syndromes and in LO-AD, while the relative involvement of other functional networks drives the clinical phenotype in each AD variant. Aim 3 investigates how functional connectivity in healthy adults relates to the patterns of amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration in AD variants, in order to test a model in which A? deposition is driven by nodal stress in cortical hubs, while neurodegeneration originates in syndrome-specific epicenters within the DMN that initiate the trans-neuronal spread of disease and drive the clinical phenotype. These investigations will facilitate the early and accurate diagnosis of EO AD variants, and will further our understanding of the relationships between clinical phenotype, structural and functional brain changes and molecular pathology in AD.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an established relationship between anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Following injury and surgical reconstruction, OA is reported in the medial compartment of the involved knee in 30 to 60% of patients within five to eight years. While increased muscle co-contraction often occurs in the unloaded knee, more detailed biomechanical analysis from our lab has shown that the involved knee undergoes unloading in the medial compartment. That is, the compressive joint contact force in the medial compartment of the involved knee is less than in the uninvolved knee during gait. The unloading is observed immediately after injury and is still quite pronounced at six months, but loading returns to normal two years after ACL reconstruction. However, differences in loading between impaired and unimpaired limbs at six months post-surgery is correlated with OA development 5 years post-surgery. In this study, we will examine the biomechanical and biochemical basis for this by studying people at 3 months, 6 months and 2 years following ACL reconstruction. In the first aim, we will explore the biomechanical basis of this unloading using EMG and gait analysis techniques, couple with the use of a biomechanical model that will allow joint contact force estimation. In Aim 2, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging of the knee will be used to discern biochemical changes in the cartilage during the post-surgery period (same three time points). T1? and T2 relaxation time quantification (indicative of glycosaminoglycan loss and decreased collagen matrix organization) will be performed for each limb. In Aim 3, we will examine the effect of knee loading differences on knee cartilage stress distribution, using a finite element model. This will enable us to determine how the loading and biochemical changes influence the pressure in the cartilage. We believe that these aims will enable us to understand the mechanisms governing knee unloading following ACL reconstruction and will enable us to make recommendations for clinical treatment paths to avoid subsequent OA development in this population.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current research on aging has largely focused the molecular mechanisms of age-related diseases, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with several human diseases of aging. However, the cellular mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction and how they lead to age-related diseases are not known. Chemical modifications to mitochondrial proteins control several aspects of mitochondrial function, and the long-term goal of this project is to understand how these modifications are regulated by the NAD(+)-dependent sirtuin deacylases and influence the diseases of aging. The objective of this proposal is to define the role of SIRT5 in the molecular mechanisms of aging. The central hypothesis is that SIRT5 regulates mitochondrial function by removing a newly discovered acyl modification from mitochondrial proteins. In the absence of SIRT5, mitochondrial proteins will become hyper-acylated, have reduced mitochondrial function, and exhibit several markers of accelerated aging. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on preliminary data, which suggests an important role for SIRT5 in the cellular mechanisms of aging and disease. To test these hypotheses, three specific aims will be pursued: 1. Determine the changes in protein acylation as a function of age, using a proteomic strategy to quantify hepatic mitochondrial protein acylation from young, middle-aged, and old mice; 2. Determine the effect of this novel acyl modification on protein function by using a combination of cell and murine models, in order to measure the changes in protein activity of specific proteins, as well as the overall function of mitochondria; 3. Determine role of SIRT5 on aging by measuring several physiological parameters of aging using both in vitro cellular assays and in vivo assays in mice, to determine how SIRT5 maintains mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis during aging. This study combines a novel protein modification, a comprehensive experimental design, and an innovative conceptual framework. Furthermore, this study will build a foundation for this early-stage investigator and ensure a successful research program focused on the cellular mechanisms of aging and disease. Importantly, the proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand understanding how mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to age-related diseases. Ultimately such knowledge has the potential to inform the development of new therapies against several diseases of aging.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Initiative for Maximizing Student Development at Vanderbilt University exists to increase the number of Ph.D.'s awarded to graduate students in biomedical research who are underrepresented, as broadly defined by the NIH. Our nation faces many challenges in biomedical research to find better treatments and hopefully cures for a range of debilitating and/or fatal diseases such as cancer, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. The innovation and problem solving needed to make progress in these areas requires a diverse group of talented scientists, because diversity generates greater numbers of new perspectives and more inventive solutions. For these reasons and given the demographic shifts in the population, the Vanderbilt IMSD has a key mission to ensure that the most talented of this country's increasingly diverse youth are trained for careers in biomedical research, especially those whose talent would be otherwise unrecognized or unrealized. We want to ensure our diverse Ph.D. trainees are well prepared to enter a range of career paths, but particularly the professoriate where, as scientific leaders, they will be responsible for drivig novel problem-solving approaches and training the next generation to follow. By implementing a holistic admissions approach, we have fully achieved the goal of enrolling a diverse group of graduate trainees, now ranging from 20-28% URM in our first-year graduate programs. Moreover, the Vanderbilt IMSD program, which began in 2007, has so far produced 13 Ph.D. graduates who have gone on to either academic postdoctoral positions at research-intensive universities, biopharma, or in one case a tenure-track faculty position at a minority serving institution. Nearly two dozen more advanced IMSD graduate students will be completing their Ph.D. training in the next 2-3 years ahead. We propose to maintain all of the support and development programs and comprehensive mentoring, especially peer mentoring, that have been vital to our IMSD program's success. Taking our cue from the adage begin with the end in mind, we are planning a new initiative Joining the Professoriate that will focus on the development of leadership skills through both explicit training (in collaboration with the Vanderbilt Owen Graduate School of Business) and frequent exposures to highly successful visiting URM faculty role models. Although URMs now comprise one-third of the US college-age population, they earn only 15-17% of the B.S./B.A. degrees in STEM fields. Thus, in order to sustain our progress, we need to address the undergraduate pipeline. In collaboration with the Vanderbilt Center for Science Outreach, we have designed an innovative pre-college summer science outreach program to offer URM pre-college students an opportunity to begin developing a science identity while still in high school. Simultaneously, the IMSD graduate students who design, direct, and implement the program will gain valuable leadership and teaching skills. We plan regular summative and formative assessments of all our programs to ensure they are adding value and aligned with our mission.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Obesity prevention efforts are increasingly focused on early childhood. Emerging evidence suggests that the emotional quality of interactions between parents and children impacts risk for obesity and self-regulation may be an explanatory mechanism. However, parent-child interactions are traditionally observed during play, and mealtime interactions have not been studied over time in relationship to children's obesity risk. Further, which aspects of self-regulation are involved is unclear. Children born preterm have risks for obesity that are similar to children born at term, and preterm children are at higher risk for deficits in self-regulation. The objective of this application is to conduct a longitudinal study of toddlers (of all gestational ages) to determine how the quality of parent-child interactions observed in mealtime and play settings in the home and laboratory impacts changes in weight and adiposity through preschool-age, and to identify the aspects of self-regulation that are involved. Our central hypothesis is that trajectories of parent-child mealtime interaction will differ and predict risk for obesity at 42 months more robustly than observations of parent-child interaction during play, with gestational age and temperamental reactivity as effect modifiers, and emotion regulation as the aspect of self- regulation most strongly associated with obesity. The rationale for the current project is that strategies to prevent obesity in young children are urgently needed and parent engagement will be crucial to their success; studying parent-child interaction over time and across contexts, with children of all gestational ages, will facilitate identification of modifiable targets for obesity prevention. The proposal has three specific aims: 1) to characterize trajectories of parent-child mealtime interactions across the toddler to preschool period relative to parent-child interactions in play, 2) to identify parent-child mealtime interactions that increase risk for obesity, and 3) to determine the aspects of self-regulation that predict healthy weight in preschool-aged children and identify precursors. Our approach to accomplish these aims will be a prospective study of 250 children enrolled at 18 months and assessed at 24, 36, and 42 months of age in our laboratory and in their homes. Parent-child interaction during play and during mealtimes at home and in a standardized buffet lunch in the laboratory will be observed and objectively coded. Self-regulation at preschool-age will be assessed using a battery of objective tasks and parent-report. The expected outcomes of this research will be detailed understanding of the aspects of self-regulation and parent-child mealtime interactions that are associated with risk for obesity in early childhood. The project is innovative in bringing concepts and methods from developmental science to the challenge of childhood obesity and utilizing objective coding of observed parent-child interactions in mealtime and non-mealtime contexts over time and with children of all gestational ages. The project is significant because it will bring a dyadic perspective to research on parenting and childhood obesity and what is learned can be applied to have a positive impact on the health and well-being of children and families.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that is located in the bone marrow (BM) and remains fatal for the majority of patients. Despite an increasing knowledge about the underlying tumor biology of MM, the mechanisms leading to relapse and finally to treatment failure have not been sufficiently identified. One possible explanation could be that previous studies were based almost exclusively on tumor specimens randomly collected from a single site of the skeleton, usually the iliac crest of the pelvis. Imaging studies, however, have shown MM to be a heterogeneously distributed disease with the majority of patients presenting with nodular accumulations of malignant plasma cells scattered throughout the bone marrow containing skeletal system ? so called focal lesions (FLs). Notably, the number of FLs represents an independent, negative prognostic marker for disease outcome. Furthermore, our own sequencing and expression data have revealed an accumulation of poor prognosis mutations in these regions and tumor growth-promoting conditions, which suggests that FLs are hotspots of tumor evolution. Despite their prognostic role, FLs are poorly understood and their cellular and extracellular composition and the interplay between these components remain uncharacterized. The central hypothesis of the proposed work is that specific tumor?microenvironmental (ME) interactions within FLs foster MM evolution, which finally leads to high-risk transformation and, subsequently, to relapse and treatment failure. To address this hypothesis, we will investigate the genotypic and phenotypic states of tumor and ME cells in FLs by single-cell RNA sequencing (Aim 1). BM specimens from non-FL sites from the same patient will be utilized as a control. The analysis of the proliferation and senescence state, variation in oncogenic signaling pathways, and various programs resulting in the exhaustion of T cells will unravel the specific features of FLs compared to other BM sites. Furthermore, we will perform a spatial-temporal DNA sequencing study of specimens from FLs and other sites of the skeletal system to determine the impact of anti-MM treatment on the spatial clonal architecture and the evolutionary history of selected clones (Aim 2). This will elucidate tumor-intrinsic mutational drivers and the mechanisms leading to drug-resistance and high-risk disease. To determine the functional consequences of key findings from this work, we will use our in-house SCID-rab model, a sophisticated murine model that allows for growth of MM cells in implanted rabbit bones (Aim 3). As a first step in these studies, will introduce an activating mutation into the STAT3 gene in the IL-6-dependent MM cell line INA-6 and introduce it into the SCID-rab model. This will reveal whether this variant leads to BM independency of the cell line and facilitates growth as FLs and/or at sites outside the BM. Successful completion of these studies will provide a mechanistic explanation for the prognostic value of the number of FLs. This will allow for the development of more effective therapies and finally lead to the cure of MM, which is the long-standing goal of this work.  ',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) experience metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, pressure ulcers, and cardiovascular disease at far greater rates than the general population. A rehabilitation method to prevent or reverse the systemic metabolic consequences of SCI is a pressing need. The purpose of this study is to determine the dose of muscle activity that can enhance an oxidative muscle phenotype, and improve clinical markers of metabolic and bone turnover health in patients with acute SCI. The long-term goal of this research is to develop exercise-based interventions to prevent secondary health conditions such as diabetes and to ultimately protect health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Specific Aim 1: To compare changes in skeletal muscle gene regulation in individuals with acute SCI who receive high muscle force standing (HS), low muscle force standing (LS), passive standing (PS), or usual care - (no stimulation and no standing, NS) for 16 weeks. We hypothesize that mRNA expression for metabolic transcription factors and for genes regulating glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial remodeling will support that HS and LS instigate a greater shift toward an oxidative muscle phenotype than PS or NS. A novel finding will be that LS is a powerful regulator of oxidative pathways in skeletal muscle. Specific Aim 2: To compare changes in systemic markers of metabolic health and bone turnover in individuals with SCI who receive HS, LS, PS, or NS for 16 weeks. We hypothesize that HS and LS will demonstrate lower glucose/insulin levels and greater glucagon suppression during oral glucose challenge compared to PS and NS. HS and LS will also demonstrate lower HOMA scores, hemoglobin A1c, fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). LS will be an effective regulator of systemic markers of metabolism. We also hypothesize that HS will demonstrate higher serum levels of osteocalcin, lower levels of type 1 collagen C-telopeptide (CTX), and lower levels of sclerostin than all other groups (HS>LS>PS>NS), indicating an anti-catabolic effect on bone. As a secondary aim, we will measure secondary health conditions (SHCs), HRQOL, and cost effectiveness. We expect that the HS, LS, and PS groups will all show a trend for improved SHCs and HRQOL compared to usual care. We also expect to see an association between metabolic improvement and improved perception of HRQOL. These observations will support that this intervention has strong feasibility for future clinical translaion.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms through which tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YRS) exerts its newly recognized role in regulating platelet production and, on the bases of this information, develop a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of thrombocytopenia. In preliminary studies we have determined that YRS exhibits the previously unrecognized property of accelerating megakaryocyte development and platelet generation. This effect appears to be independent of thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling because YRS can support the proliferation and maturation of c-Mpl-/- (TPO receptor knock-out) mouse megakaryocytes in vitro. The studies proposed in this application will establish the mechanisms underlying the novel function of YRS in the regulation of platelet production. We will also develop a pharmaceutical approach to a new class of drugs with the potential of enhancing platelet production in various diseases in which TPO mimetics alone are not effective. In aim 1, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which YRS stimulates megakaryocytopoiesis. Based on preliminary studies, the effect of YRS on megakaryocytopoiesis is mediated by at least two mechanisms: (1) activation of monocytic cells and cytokine production, and (2) expansion of Sca1+CD11b+ progenitors that give rise to hematopoietic cells and vascular cells. We will identify the cells responsible to mediate the effect of YRS and the receptor(s) targeted in the process. Involvement of TLR-MyD88 pathway has been shown by preliminary testing of TLR2-/- and MyD88-/- mice. We will also focus on a unique population of Sca1+CD11b+ progenitor cells that are greatly expanded by YRS stimulation in bone marrow cell cultures. Our preliminary result suggested the differentiation potential of YRS-induced Sca1+CD11b+ progenitor cells into hematopoietic cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. We hypothesize that expansion of these progenitor cells also contributes to thrombocytopoiesis either by differentiating into hematopoietic progenitors or vascular cells that support proplatelet formation in the vascular niche. In aim 2, we will define the functional domains of YRS required to exert the effects on megakaryocytopoiesis, and use protein engineering to de- sign YRS variants with an optimal therapeutic window. In Aim 3, we will test the efficacy of engineered YRS as a potential drug for the treatment of thrombocytopenia using in vivo animal models. In addition to the acute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia model employed in preliminary studies, we are generating models of chronic thrombocytopenia induced by low-dose antibody administration, irradiation or chemotherapy to evaluate the effects of YRS in various conditions as may occur in human pathology. Finally, to test the possibility of thrombotic side effects, we will determine whether YRS affects platelet activation, platelet-leukocyte inter- actions and models of thrombosis. The studies proposed in this application will delineate a novel cellular pathway in which YRS contributes to the regulation of platelet production; and support the development of innovative approaches with translational potential for improving the treatment of thrombocytopenia.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and von Willebrand disease (VWF deficiency) are well recognized severe and/or common bleeding disorders that require frequent treatment with IV infusion of clotting factors ? FVIII and VWF respectively. Studies by our laboratory and others suggest a unique relationship between VWF and FVIII that will be explored further in this proposal. While prophylaxis to prevent bleeding is the current standard of care, this requires infusions several times a week. While gene therapy could be curative, studies in patients have yet to achieve adequate efficacy except in patients with hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency). Over the past several years our laboratory has focused on delivering FVIII by targeting expression to the platelet so that FVIII is stored together with VWF and this approach results in therapeutic efficacy even in the presence of high titer FVIII inhibitors. The local release of the FVIII/VWF complex circumvents the immediate inactivation of FVIII and permits cessation of bleeding even in the face of high-titer FVIII inhibitory antibodies. In Aim-1 a second animal model has been developed to study the role of the VWF and FVIII complex in gene therapy of hemophilia A even in the context of FVIII inhibitors in a rat model that has both spontaneous bleeding, a high propensity to form FVIII inhibitory antibodies, and has a blood volume size that enables easy sequential sampling unlike the mouse where sequential time points require animal sacrifice rather than sequential phlebotomy. This can substantiate the efficacy of 2bF8 in an inhibitor prone model and potentially demonstrate efficacy in preventing spontaneous bleeding ? a characteristic that cannot be studied in the mouse or the dog were spontaneous bleeding is difficult to study. While it is well recognized that VWF prolongs the survival of FVIII, in Aim 2 we will explore the functional importance of this VWF delivering FVIII to the site of the evolving thrombus. In Aim 3 we will further study VWF and FVIII synthesis and the cells that produce them as a complex and as individual proteins. These three aims will further our understanding of the biologic role for the complex of FVIII and VWF in normal hemostasis and thrombosis and through these interactions offer a strategy for effectively treating hemophilia A subjects with FVIII inhibitors through a unique gene therapy strategy that ectopically expresses FVIII with VWF in platelets.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Stroke affects over 7.5 million patients in the U.S, with an estimated 795,000 additional cases of stroke occurring each year. Over 30% of stroke survivors have spasticity, a disorder of muscle tone that can cause striking impairments in functional movement. Pharmacological, surgical and physical treatments to manage spasticity have, at best, short-term efficacy and are confounded by side effects. In this NINDS CREATE Device project, we propose translational activities that will advance through multi-site Phase II clinical trials and regulatory submission a recently developed neuromodulation device that non-invasively treats spasticity using a novel approach that combines trans-spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) with simultaneous peripheral nerve stimulation. The implications of the current project are far-reaching changes in clinical practice for treating spasticity using an entirely novel approach based on non-invasive neuromodulation. PathMaker Neurosystems Inc. is a clinical-stage neuromodulation company developing a first-in-class treatment for treating stroke patients with spasticity. Our objective for this NINDS CREATE Device project is to carry out key translational activities that will be essential for advancing this technology through multi-site Phase II clinical trials and regulatory approval as a safe and efficacious new treatment for spasticity. The project consists of 5 Specific Aims: In Specific Aim 1, we will implement a GMP-compliant version of the device (MyoRegulator) for use in a Phase II pivotal clinical study in stroke. In Specific Aim 2, we will implement a compliant Quality Management System (QMS). In Specific Aim 3, we will complete preparations for a Phase II clinical study. In Specific Aim 4, we will complete a multi-site double-blind controlled human clinical study. In Specific Aim 5, we will submit De Novo 510(k) for regulatory approval for MyoRegulator. These Specific Aims will lay the essential groundwork allowing our novel, NIH-funded technology to move rapidly through human clinical trials and to regulatory approval. As our company works to translate the groundbreaking academic studies that have resulted in a novel approach to the treatment of spasticity, NINDS CREATE Device support will advance this breakthrough treatment towards the market and enable an entirely new treatment option for stroke patients with spasticity.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary    Mechanotransduction  (MET)  channels  reside  at  the  tips  of  inner  ear  hair?cell  stereocilia,  where  they  mediate  the  conversion  of  sound?induced  mechanical  stimuli  into  electrical  signals  that  are  transmitted  to  the  brain.  These miniature machines open in response to mechanical change and allow a selective influx of cations into  hair  cells.  Their  molecular  identity  has  already  been  pursued  for  over  two  decades.  Excitingly,  a  number  of  membrane proteins have been recently implicated as critical components of the MET channel complex: TMC1,  TMHS and TMIE. The dysfunction of any of these proteins is associated with hearing loss. To date, strategies  for pharmacological intervention are greatly limited, partly due to lack of our understanding of these proteins'  respective  role  during  mechanotranduction.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  illuminate  these  proteins'  atomic  structure, their interplay, and their mechanism of the action. Here, we will integrate experimental techniques  including single particle cryo?electron microscopy, protein biochemistry and engineering, in order to provide a  detailed  understanding  of  these  proteins'  mechanical  and  structural  properties.

       " \"Project Summary/Abstract  There is an unmet demand for functional characterization of variants observed in clinical DNA sequencing. This is evidenced by sequencing tests frequently reporting `variants of uncertain significance', information that cannot be acted on clinically. Of the approaches to characterize mutations in the absence of genetic evidence, all current methods have limitations ? namely, they aren't scalable to the large number of variants being sequenced, or they have inherent limits to their accuracy, a key one of which is that variants are removed from their genomic contexts to be assayed. This project aims to significantly improve experimental variant testing by using a novel genome editing method. This technique, called saturation editing, enables functional testing of large numbers of variants in multiplex, each in their endogenous genomic location. Through application to two genes in which mutations cause either chemotherapy resistance or oncogenesis, the method will yield powerful and accurate data for thousands of variants potentially playing key roles in disease.  The first goal will be to generate functional scores for every variant across the coding sequence of the HPRT1 gene for causing resistance to the leukemia drug, 6-thioguanine. This work will provide a richly informative database of variant effects as measured in the genome that can be compared to data from HPRT1- deficient patients to evaluate accuracy. Next, by extending this assay to study over 1,000 mutations in non- coding regions of the same gene, the potential for loss-of-function mutations in non-coding sequences of the genome will be systematically interrogated for the first time. This will provide insights into why clinical sequencing sometimes fails to find coding mutations despite knowledge of which gene is mutated. Finally, saturation editing will be implemented to assay BRCA1 variants for their affects on the homology-directed repair pathway. Experiments will be targeted to the RING domain of BRCA1, where there is a high occurrence of pathogenic missense mutations, most of which have been incompletely characterized. The ability of BRCA1 variants to promote homology-directed repair accurately predicts whether a BRCA1 variant maintains tumor- suppressor function or not. Through this study, more interpretable functional scores for hundreds of BRCA1 variants will be generated, potentially informing clinical decision-making. Collectively, these experiments will generate valuable data for the cancer community, while also establishing a new approach for scalable and accurate functional testing of variants in genes relevant to cancer.\",\n",
       " '  Epidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is among the most frequent of cancers. It is treated by surgical excision, but the recurrence and metastatic rates approach 10%. Our scientific premise is that human epidermal cancer stem (ECS) cells are formed early in skin cancer and these cells are important cancer prevention targets. An important goal in this context is identifying and inhibiting activity of key proteins that are elevated and essential for ECS cell survival. Of particular interest, we show that tissue transglutaminase (TG2), an emerging cancer stem cell survival regulator, is highly elevated in ECS cells as compared to non- stem cancer cells. Of further importance, TG2 knockdown or treatment with sulforaphane (SFN), a promising diet-derived cancer prevention agent, reduces TG2 activity which is associated with reduced ECS cell survival and additional new studies indicate that TG2-knockout markedly reduces ECS cell tumor formation. We also provide new data suggesting that SFN covalently modifies TG2 to shifts its structure to an open inactivate conformation. These novel findings suggest that SFN treatment converts TG2 from a closed (GTP binding, signaling) pro-ECS cell survival form to an open inactive conformation. Our goal is to characterize this unique regulation to provide new understanding of how SFN influences this important target. We will test the idea that SFN treatment may regulate TG2 structure via mechanisms that involve direct covalent modification, and study the role of TG2 as a mediator of SFN action and a SFN treatment target in cultured ECS cells and tumors.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Climate change will lead to more intense and longer-lasting extreme weather events, such as floods, hurricanes, and severe storms, which will lead to more frequent power outage (PO). Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the impact of PO on human health: most previous studies were based on self-reported survey data, which is subject to reporting bias. In addition to weather factors that directly affect human health, other concurrent factors such as PO may also mediate with extreme weather on health, for which research is also lacking. Few studies assessed both power infrastructures and population vulnerabilities, and compared the effects of different PO causes. Furthermore, no health prediction models have been developed for PO. To fill these knowledge gaps, the proposed study will build upon multiple ongoing/ completed studies to: 1) assess the effects and mediating pathways of PO on electricity-dependent health outcomes, co-morbidities, and nursing home transfers; 2) identify infrastructure, environmental, and population vulnerabilities (individual and community); and 3) develop a vulnerability index and prediction model. We will effectively link the accessible New York statewide hospital admission and emergency department (ED) visit data with the existing data on PO, weather, air pollution, census, and nursing home transfer data. The associations between PO causes, frequency, duration, or area coverage of PO and electricity-dependent hospitalizations or ED visits due to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dialysis, water-/food-borne diseases, injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning will be assessed through Bayesian spatial-temporal model. This advanced technique will be able to control for both socio-demographic differences by regions and multiple temporal variables simultaneously. To improve scientific rigor, we will use control days (without PO and extreme weather) to separate PO from weather effects, and control diseases (e.g. appendicitis) to examine temporal changes of disease reporting. To understand PO?s natural direct and indirect effects, causal mediation analysis will be used. Furthermore, new variable selection methods, including Sure Independence Screening and Generalized Additive Model Selection will be used to screen and select predictors highly associated with outcomes. A composite vulnerability index weighed by risk factors identified and vulnerability maps will be developed. We will establish PO and PO-related health predictive models using the state-of-the-art data mining techniques, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Tree, and Ensemble Learning Decision Tree model. The excellent team with multidisciplinary and experienced investigators, numerous already collected and geocoded datasets, innovative data mining and analysis methods, continuation of student training, and successful prior partnerships with government agencies will maximize the probability of our success and feasibility. This project will also significantly enhance our institute?s environment and students? involvement in research, and our findings will identify evidence-based strategies for emergency management and public health preparedness.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the reasons behind the high prevalence of obesity in Samoa, which is among the highest observed across the globe. Over 80% of Samoan adults are overweight or obese, with severe obesity reaching an alarming 33% in women in American Samoa. In a genome-wide association study we recently identified a novel missense variant (p.Arg457Gln, minor allele frequency 0.259) in CREB3 Regulatory Factor (CREBRF) that is highly associated with BMI, with an effect size greater than any known common BMI risk variant. The overall goal of this research project is to gain insight into the metabolic differences responsible for the excess weight gain associated with the CREBRF variant. Based on our observations that overexpression of the missense variant promotes lipid storage and reduces energy substrate oxidation (decreased mitochondrial respiration) in an adipocyte model, our hypothesis is that a lower resting metabolic rate (RMR) is involved. Supporting a relationship between low mitochondrial respiration and low RMR, we recently observed that lower skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration is associated with lower RMR in African American women (AAW). In addition, we recently demonstrated lower intervention induced weight loss in AAW compared to Caucasian women due to a lower RMR, leading to lower energy requirements. Based on these observations, and the fact that the majority of genes known to contribute to human obesity do so primarily by influencing the central control of energy intake and/or expenditure, we propose to determine the role that energy expenditure (EE) and energy intake (EI) play in the increased obesity risk in the Samoan population associated with the CREBRF missense variant. Based on our long-term experience working with obesity and health risks in the Samoan population, combined with our extensive experience assessing energy and substrate metabolism, our research team is ideally positioned to conduct these studies. We propose a longitudinal study to define the impact of the variant on energy balance in human subjects with zero, one, or two copies of the risk allele to address the following three specific aims: 1) to determine the components of EE and substrate metabolism [RMR; TEF, thermic effect of food; total EE; RQ, substrate utilization; and PA, physical activity] using gold standard methods that include doubly-labeled water (DLW), indirect calorimetry, and objective activity monitoring; 2) to determine EI using the gold standard method of DLW intake balance technique; and 3) to determine the relationship between energy metabolism and weight gain by comparing the above energy metabolism parameters and weight gain over 24-36 months. In the applicants opinion the proposed studies will provide novel, and significant insight into the metabolic differences responsible for the excess weight gain in those with the CREBRF variant, which in turn plays a significant role in the extreme prevalence of obesity in Samoa. This research will advance the understanding, prevention, and appropriate treatment of obesity and heart diseases in this high risk population.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Regulatory T (Treg) cells characterized by the expression of the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) play a central role in the control of immune tolerance to self-antigens, allergens, and commensals as well as immune responses to pathogens and tumors. mTORC1 is a master growth regulator that is essential for Treg cell function in vivo, as mice with Treg cell-specific loss of mTORC1 develop rampant autoimmune disease and die at an early age. mTORC1 integrates signals that reflect the availability of growth factors and the nutritional status of an organism. Amino acids is an essential nutrient metabolite that makes up the majority of mammalian cell mass and functions as critical regulator of mTORC1 signaling. Nevertheless, whether amino acid sensing plays a role in Treg cell function remains elusive. To this end, this proposal will study the role of the Rag GTPases dependent amino acid-sensing pathway in Treg cell homeostasis and function. Preliminary studies revealed that constitutive activation of this pathway resulted in deregulated Treg cell homeostasis and precipitated immune activations in mice, most prominently at sites where Treg cells are constantly bathed in fluctuating levels of nutrients, such as the liver and the intestine. It is thus hypothesized that repression of the amino acid-sensing pathway is essential for Treg cells to maintain stable expression of Treg cell characteristic molecules and suppressive function, and the lack of this negative regulation results in overt immune activation. This proposal seeks to characterize how constitutive activation of the amino acid-sensing pathway affect Treg cells by characterizing the proliferation, survival, and suppressive function of Treg cells. Furthermore, this study will investigate if deregulation of the amino acid-sensing pathway bypasses the stringent requirement of strong T cell receptor and IL-2 signaling in proliferating Treg cells, resulting in the generation of defective Treg cells. Finally, this study will investigate if constitutively activated amino acid sensing affects Treg cell functions in chronic viral infection and cancer. Together, this research will shed light on how the sensing of amino acid affects Treg cell homeostasis and function. From a clinical standpoint, altered Treg cell homeostasis can contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases including infections and cancers. Thus, this proposed research may uncover ways to modulate immunity and inflammation for therapeutic benefit.',\n",
       " \"Abstract:  Using a mouse model of hepatitis B virus (HBV), the goals of this proposal are to determine: 1) how group 3 innate lymphocytes (ILC3s) contribute to HBV disease pathogenesis and 2) whether age plays a role in ILC3 function during an HBV immune response. The first portion of this proposal focuses on studying how HBV pathogenesis is affected by ILC3-deficiency through monitoring serological markers of HBV clearance and persistence, measuring the strength and diversity of effector T cell responses, evaluating the extent and quality of B cell responses and assessing lymphoid organization in the liver. The role of specific ILC3-derived cytokines will also be investigated by blocking their signaling during HBV-induced immunity to determine which ILC3 effector molecules contribute to ILC3 function in the liver. The second part of this proposal focuses on quantifying and qualifying age-dependent differences in hepatic ILC3s in an effort to better understand how age directs human HBV pathogenesis. This will be accomplished by measuring the expression of key cytokines and surface molecules in liver ILC3s over time during the initiation of an immune response to HBV in adult and young mice, as well as investigating the impact that ILC3 stimulation has on HBV pathogenesis in an age-dependent manner. Finally, age-dependent patterns of ILC3s identified in the mouse model will be compared to adult and infant human liver biopsies to determine the relevance of these findings in humans.  Information gathered from this proposal will represent significant progress towards understanding how immunity is orchestrated in the liver. It is clear that the liver employs unique strategies for determining self versus non-self due to the constant influx of non-self antigens from commensal organisms in the intestines, particularly at an early age when the GI tract is undergoing microbial colonization. Hepatitis B virus research shows that while the immune response in adults is often effective in controlling HBV infection, infants' and young children's immune responses in the liver are ineffective at clearing the virus, often leading to persistent infection. Thus, it is critical that we characterize age-dependent differences within the liver that direct effective versus ineffective immunity so that we can identify better therapeutic targets for the millions of patients living with chronic HBV. Defining the role of ILC3s in HBV pathogenesis is one step toward this goal and is essential for a comprehensive understanding of hepatic immunity. These studies will also garner insight on the greater role of ILC3s during infection and provide clues as to why these cells are most important in tissues that experience high microbial exposure.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract Abnormal oncogenic activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is a key trigger in inducing various types of cancers including lung cancer, which is recognized as one of the most important active targets for NSCLC treatment. The application of EGFR-targeted inhibitors has provided significant benefit for lung cancer patient treatment. However, the acquisition of resistance to EGFR-targeted inhibitors in cancer cells is the major challenge for clinicians and oncologists. In addition to known genetic alterations such as EGFR secondary mutations causing EGFR-TKI resistance, compensatory activation of signaling pathways without interruption of genome integrity remains to be defined. Our preliminary data showed a persistent S6K1 activation in resistant non-small lung cancer cells upon EGFR-TKIs treatment, but not in sensitive cells. Ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1, RPS6KB1), a member of AGC family of serine/threonine protein kinases and a key effector of the mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1), is known to regulates protein synthesis, cell cycle, cell growth and survival in response to growth factors, and cytokines under both physiological condition and pathological condition. Deregulation of S6K1 is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in lung, colorectal, ovarian, and breast cancer. However the link of S6K1 with drug resistance remains to be elucidated. We hypothesize that S6K1 activation contributes to the acquired resistance to EGFR target therapy in NSCLCs. We plan to test this hypothesis through three aims. Aim 1 is to investigate if S6K1 activation is a new mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR target therapy in NSCLC. Aim 2 is to investigate molecular mechanism of EGFR-TKI- resistance through S6K1 pathway. Aim 3 is to investigate the effect of S6K1 inhibitor PF4708671 for overcoming EGRF-TKI resistance. The proposal will help to understand new mechanism in response to EGFR-TKI and to identify S6K1 and its signaling as potential new druggable target(s). The successful completion of proposed study will provide a potential therapeutic strategy by overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance for lung cancer treatment in the future. ',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The burden of prostate cancer among Veterans is substantial with over 200,000 survivors and  12,000 new diagnoses annually. Most men live with rather than die from this common disease  making prostate cancer survivorship care especially important. Because of its leadership in  chronic disease care and the proportion of older men served, the Veterans Health  Administration (VHA) is well positioned to become one of the national leaders in prostate cancer  survivorship care. However, the quality of Veteran prostate cancer survivorship care is largely  unknown. In addition, there is poor consensus about whether primary care providers or cancer  specialists should have primary responsibility for ongoing cancer surveillance and management  of treatment-related side effects (e.g., incontinence, osteoporosis). Ultimately, the design and  implementation of tools to optimize prostate cancer survivorship care rests upon understanding  how responsibility for survivorship care is managed and the barriers to good survivorship care.  This research program will improve our understanding of Veteran prostate cancer survivorship  care and seek to improve it using state-of-the-art implementation science methods. This  program has three aims. Aim 1: To examine variation in 2 key quality indicators of prostate  cancer survivorship care. Using national VHA data (2005-2011), we will examine variation in  the quality of prostate cancer survivorship care for cancer surveillance and bone density testing.  Aim 2: To assess barriers and facilitators to delivering high quality prostate cancer  survivorship care. Guided by theory, we will perform focus groups and interviews with primary  care providers and prostate cancer specialists to better understand how to improve survivorship  care. Aim 3: To develop, implement and pilot a theory-based intervention to improve the  quality of prostate cancer survivorship care. We will use our findings to pilot an intervention  that addresses quality gaps in cancer surveillance and bone density testing uncovered in Aim 1,  in preparation for a randomized trial. Due to the expanding population of Veteran prostate  cancer survivors, optimizing their quality of survivorship care is of the utmost importance. Our  findings will inform models for cancer survivorship care across VHA and guide future  implementation efforts to improve the quality of cancer care.',\n",
       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elderly suffer the majority of influenza hospitalizations and deaths and are a priority for determining influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). The Univ. of Pittsburgh and UPMC Health System (UPMC) are located in Allegheny County (AC), in which influenza is reportable & which has one of the 5 oldest populations in the U.S. We propose a test-negative case-control study of influenza VE in 2 UPMC hospitals to determine VE against hospitalizations of adults. UPMC has been on the US News honor roll for over a decade, including most wired and has a strong research tradition. The influenza season will be determined from syndromic surveillance from multiple hospital EDs, the Health Dept. (ACHD), & from lab data from >14,000 respiratory viral panels (RVP) done annually at UPMC. Theradoc informatics will identify adult inpatients who have had an RVP conducted. Enrollees' survey data will be directly entered into NIH's REDCap. Frailty can be assessed by survey and/or electronic medical record (EMR) data (e.g., Charleson Co-morbidity Index) to assess confounders and effect modifiers. Our Data Center manages REDCap data, EMR data from hospitalizations, & immunization data for uploading to CDC. Population-based incidence of influenza hospitalizations will be determined from ACHD and UPMC St. Margaret hospitalization data and by agent-based modeling at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Our team is a strong candidate for this project because: 1) UPMC is the dominant regional health system with a strong bond rating; 2) infection control personnel recommend RVPs to establish diagnoses, and our team's leadership responsibilities at the hospitals can further influence the use of RVPs; 3) we have published data showing excellent concordance between UPMC's GenMark RVP and the CDC's PCR for detecting influenza; 4) research shows better protection in the elderly from high-dose influenza (HD) vaccine; UPMC has recommended and promoted HD vaccine in large quantities, although regular vaccine is available, allowing for vaccine type comparisons; 5) UPMC's EMR links inpatient and outpatient vaccination records, and interfaces with the state immunization registry; 6) it includes diverse, well-published investigators who have worked together previously.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Nicholas Abend is an Associate Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. His career goal is to be an expert clinical trialist leading development of interventions that improve outcomes among children with acute brain injuries. He is completing the fifth year of a K23 Mentored Career Development award from NINDS addressing the epidemiology of electrographic seizures (ES) in critically ill children and the impact of ES on neurobehavioral outcomes. Since 2007, he has published 52 peer-reviewed research papers, including 45 related to critical care EEG and seizure management with 33 as first or senior author. To advance this line of investigation, Dr. Abend needs to extend his observational studies into interventional clinical trials capable of establishing whether optimized ES interventions improve neurobehavioral outcomes. The proposed training in clinical trial design, execution, data management, and team-science skills will optimally position Dr. Abend to conduct multi-center clinical trials of innovative neuroprotective strategies for children with acute brain injuries. Research: Dr. Abend?s K23 research has demonstrated that ES occur in 10-40% of children with acute brain injuries, and that EEG monitoring is required for identification since most ES lack any observable clinical correlate. Additionally, he has shown that high ES exposure is associated with unfavorable neurobehavioral outcomes after adjusting for brain injury severity and critical illness severity. Based on these data, an increasing number of children are undergoing EEG monitoring in pediatric intensive care units, and recent guidelines recommend widespread EEG monitoring use in critically ill children with acute brain injuries to identify ES. However, it is concerning that children experiencing high ES exposures have unfavorable outcomes despite current clinical efforts to manage ES. This problem prompts a critical need to develop optimized ES management strategies that are more targeted, appropriate, and timely to better mitigate ES induced secondary brain injury. Dr. Abend?s overall objective is to address several clinical trial readiness gaps important in conducting subsequent clinical trials of optimized ES management. Aim 1 will generate and validate a predictive model using clinical and EEG variables to discriminate between acutely encephalopathic critically ill children who will and will not subsequently experience high ES exposures. This cohort is known to have worse outcomes with current management and would be predicted to benefit from optimized management. Determining the cohort?s characteristics will be the foundation for selecting a cohort for subsequent clinical trials of ES management. Aim 2 will determine the safety and feasibility of a targeted and timely ES management intervention in critically ill children. In contrast to standard care which slowly identifies ES and escalates medications, the high-intensity multi-modal intervention consists of frequent full-array EEG review, rapid anti-seizure medication initiation following ES onset, and rapid administration of sequential anti- seizure medications at high doses if ES persist. In working towards a clinical trial addressing ES management, sub-aims will assess other clinical trial readiness gaps including the number of eligible patients, participant and clinician randomization willingness, and statistical analysis of outcome measure variation which will provide effect size estimates to inform the design of subsequent trials. Aim 3 will provide Dr. Abend with advanced training in multi-center clinical design and execution using a combination of advanced didactic coursework, training from investigators experienced in leading acute neurologic clinical trials, and practical experience conducting a clinical trial (Aim 2). This research is innovative since it will develop the first model to predict high ES exposure and thereby identify an optimal cohort for inclusion in subsequent studies, and it will perform the first safety and feasibility assessment of a standardized ES intervention in critically ill children. These contributions are significant because they provide a foundation for subsequent clinical trials that will potentially yield new neuroprotective strategies for children with acute brain injuries. Environment and Career Development: The training plan builds upon the mentorship and research infrastructure at the University of Pennsylvania and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia that have supported Dr. Abend?s current productivity. The plan involves (1) didactic coursework focused on clinical trials, patient outcomes research, regulatory issues, and team-science skills, and (2) training from investigators experienced with each component required to conduct clinical trials focused on seizure management in critically ill children, and (3) practical experience conducting a clinical trial. This training will allow Dr. Abend to develop and execute subsequent clinical trials of neuroprotective strategies in critically ill children. Summary: The research aims, training plan, and world-class clinical research infrastructure at the University of Pennsylvania and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia assure that Dr. Abend will become an even more productive independent clinical investigator who will excel at leading multi-site clinical trials focused on improving outcomes for critically ill children with acute brain injuries.\",\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Peripheral nerve injury is a frequent source of disability and a particular challenge for rehabilitation in the Veteran population. Although techniques for surgical repair have progressed, outcomes remain unpredictable. In the past, connections of the periphery to the brain had been thought to be fixed in adults, but there is a growing recognition of plasticity in brain function associated with removal of peripheral sensory input. For instance, it is known that sensory cortex associated with denervated body regions become reassigned, and disordered cortical function persists after repair of a surgical lesion. However, successful use of the limbs requires not just brain connections to peripheral targets, but also the coordinated participation o numerous activities within the brain, including interaction with other sensory sites as well as motor, visual, and cognitive areas. We therefore hypothesize that disruption of interactive brain activity underlies rehabilitation challenges after nerve injury repair. New noninvasive technology now exists to assess the integrated performance of the brain. Specifically, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can indicate coordinated activation of various brain loci, while resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fMRI) reveals patterns of communication between brain sites in the absence of stimuli. Our preliminary data show substantial disruption of coordinated brain function following experimental nerve injury and repair. We have the long-term goals of defining this phenomenon in temporal and anatomic detail, which would lay the groundwork for developing an imaging biomarker that could guide personalized rehabilitation that targets appropriate specific functions. We have the additional goal of testing whether artificially maintaining afferent sensory neuron activity to the brain during the healing phase after repair may lessen or prevent brain disorganization. In the work proposed in this SPiRE application, we will obtain initial observations to substantiate our hypotheses by defining brain responses to nerve injury/repair with and without supplying replacement afferent activity, in a limited number of animals in a longitudinal fashion, using our novel techniques. Further, we will develop the means to achieve neuronal stimulation for treatment of untethered animals using implantable optogenetic light sources that activate photosensitive channels expressed in sensory neurons after viral gene delivery. We believe that extending the rehabilitation perspective beyond the nerve repair to include brain function may open the door to a new level of refined rehabilitation assessment, planning, and success.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Science Workforce Analysis and Modeling: Understanding the Contributions of Social and Behavioral Sciences to Health Outcomes. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognizes that a robust science workforce is required to achieve national research and development goals. This renewal application develops and applies systems modeling frameworks to the science workforce, focusing on the portion of the social and behavioral workforce working to improve health outcomes. The goal is to identify policy levers to improve the science workforce for NIH and to provide practical guidance to decision makers tasked with improving the staffing of our nation's health maintenance and health care workforce. The research will use systems modeling to understand the relationships between individuals, institutions and policies in the science workforce. The research will employ combination of systems approaches, mathematical models, and data analyses. Data will be drawn from many sources including federal panel data such as the Survey of Earned Doctorates, institutional data from universities and federal agencies, and publically available data. In collaboration with NIH staff, and the advisory board for the Science Workforce Analysis and Modeling (SWAM), our research team plans to conduct research into key questions that are important to NIH's ability to understand how to assemble the science workforce for tomorrow. Researchers will first analyze the number of faculty positions in social and behavioral science fields to better understand the creation of new opportunities for researchers. Second, the research team will assess the impact of NIH funding levels on the research awards, productivity of the research, and impact on science workforce. Third, using data from individual institutions, research will examine the production of new graduates in social and behavioral science fields and their subsequent assimilation into the contributing science workforce. Finally, most likely using agent-based modeling, the researchers will design and build a dynamic model of the science workforce system, helping to understand how individual choices and institutional policies interact with each other to produce the most qualified workforce for the future of the nation. Whenever possible, the analyses at all levels will consider issues of workforce diversity and associated policy levels to improve outcomes in merit-based settings. Through models, leaders at NIH and the government can understand programs designed to improve the workforce, as well as describe the tradeoffs and unanticipated results of policies. Models of the science workforce must take into account the fact that the workforce of tomorrow depends both on changes to inputs that NIH has some control over (such as research funding) and social or economic realities that agencies can not readily influence.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cells become more susceptible to disease as they age, and thus understanding the fundamental molecular mechanisms that regulate aging is important to public health. Aging cells undergo profound shifts in gene expression that are regulated, in part, by epigenetic changes. These epigenetic alterations include histone methylation and acetylation as well as cytosine methylation. The modified epigenetic state results in the expression of genes needed for protection during cell death (antioxidant genes) as well as inappropriate expression of normally silenced regions. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate the importance of epigenetic changes that accompany leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana. Specific aims include the analysis of potential regulatory genes that show both an increase in gene expression and a gain in the histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) mark to determine if primary response genes are marked by H3K4me3. Critical histone modifiers will be identified by genetic analysis using altered gene expression as the selective criteria. In addition, the loss of cytosine methylation during aging will be tested for u-regulated genes and one up-regulated transposon. Although the model organism is a plant, many of the same protective genes (i.e. glutathione) are expressed in plants and animals, and silencing of repetitive DNA regions is essential for the genome integrity of both plants and animals.',\n",
       " 'The overall goal of the Administrative Core of the Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) Appalachian Center for Cellular transport in Obesity Related Disorders (ACCORD) at the Marshall University School of Medicine (MUSOM) is to provide administrative oversight for the career development of ACCORD investigators as well as growth and sustainability of Center infrastructure. We envision the creation of a national center of excellence to promote cellular transport physiology in obesity related disorders at MUSOM, as this institution is at the epicenter of the obesity epidemic of this region. The emphasis of biomedical research will be on cellular and molecular transport abnormalities in obesity associated conditions such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, certain tumors and developmental disabilities. A comprehensive plan for administrative, fiscal, and scientific support will be established and implemented to assure appropriate supervision and direction of ACCORD. A robust plan for individual and group mentoring will be implemented as a foundational component of this COBRE. Mentoring will encompass all aspects of development of junior investigators including, but not limited to, management of lab finances and personnel, meeting individual time- framed research goals, preparation of manuscripts and presentations, development of extramural grants including R01 level funding proposals, and any additional individualized needs as identified. The expected outcome is successful acquisition of R01 NIH funding to sustain and build upon the research foundations that are already established. To further advance the research capacity, ACCORD will closely interact with existing resources (e.g., WV INBRE, UK/MU CTSA), and establish new programs. These will include 1. the Biostatistics and Study Design preCore and Mentoring and Workforce Development preCore that will be grown during phase I to become a full Cores in Phase II of this COBRE; and, 2. Pilot funding to enhance molecular and intracellular regulation of cellular transport in obesity related disorders. Finally, formative and summative evaluation of scientific integrity, progress, and accomplishments of ACCORD will be regularly conducted in a comprehensive manner. Based on results and advice of the Internal Advisory Committee (including its Executive Committee) and External Advisory Committee, appropriate corrective steps, as well as prospective steps to advance the mission of the ACCORD COBRE, will be regularly instituted. With this innovative and much needed Appalachian region program, we will train the next generation of investigators to conduct cellular transport research in obesity which contributes to much of the health care disparities not only in WV, but also in many other regions of this country.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyloid light chain (AL) or primary amyloidosis is the most prevalent systemic amyloidosis worldwide. More than half of patients with AL amyloidosis present with cardiac involvement, resulting in the development of a rapidly progressive AL amyloid cardiomyopathy, with limited response to current therapies and median survival of 13 months. We have identified a potent cardiotoxic response in cardiomyocytes to human amyloidogenic light chain (AL-LC) isolated from patients with AL amyloid cardiomyopathy, as a critical component of the disease's pathogenesis. However, the mechanism underlying AL-LC induced cardiotoxicity have remained unclear. We have recently found that AL-LC cardiotoxicity culminates on the mitochondrial. Using comprehensive metabolomics approaches, we have found that AL-LC results in selective antagonism of mitochondrial ?-oxidation of long chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFA) with compensatory upregulation of an ER pathway of ?-oxidation, with marked increase in byproducts of ?-oxidation present in cellular models of AL-LC cardiotoxicity and patients with AL amyloid cardiomyopathy. In this proposal, we will leverage study of the largest amassed cohort of patients with AL amyloid cardiomyopathy, established cellular and animal models of AL-LC cardiotoxicity, and state of the art mass spectrometry based metabolomics to (1) define the in vivo metabolite signature of AL amyloid cardiomyopathy and to identify a first early diagnostic metabolite biomarker for this disease; (2) determine the functional significance of shifting lipid metabolism from mitochondrial ?-oxidation to ER ?-oxidation and the contribution of this process to the pathogenesis of AL-LC cardiotoxicity; and (3) to determine if bypassing or restoring mitochondrial ?-oxidation using approved agents may serve to protect against the development of AL amyloid cardiomyopathy. Our project is centered in line with the recent NIH's PA announcement (PA-13-286: Systemic Amyloidosis: Basic, Translational and Clinical Research [RO1]) and will provide unprecedented mechanistic, diagnostic and therapeutic insight into this disease process.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy for human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), is the most common genetically defined cause of intellectual disability. Structural abnormalities that are thought to contribute to learning problems are seen in the cerebellum and hippocampus of people with the condition. Treatments to correct these parts of the brain would tangibly improve the lives of children and young adults with DS and would allow them to better integrate into society. Relevance to NICHD: We recently showed that that a single injection on the day of birth of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway agonist, SAG, permanently normalizes the size and gross anatomy of the cerebellum, leads to better adult spatial problem solving, and restores electrophysiological correlates of learning in the CA1- hippocampal subfield of the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. A number of questions remain before this finding can be translated to therapy for people. We will determine how region-specific expression of Shh in the Ts65Dn brain affects hippocampal function using a conditional temporal-spatial genetics approach. This will allow us to increase Shh expression around the time of birth only within the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, or within the hippocampus, to determine where Shh stimulation is necessary and/or sufficient to correct the behavior and physiology of adult Ts65Dn mice in hippocampal tests (Specific Aim 1).  Another restraint on advancing Shh treatments to the clinic is the very wide range of effects of this potent growth factor, making systemic application in people problematic. A more confined method of drug delivery might limit side effects. Another approach is to understand which Hsa21 genes act to down-regulate the Shh pathway response in cerebellum, which might suggest more druggable targets. We identified several candidate genes in a screen of over 100 Hsa21 cDNAs in two Shh reporter cell lines and in zebrafish embryos. Genes that significantly decrease Shh pathway activation in the LIGHT2 assay will be evaluated in additional Shh-sensitive assays to assure that they generalize across different biological systems and their specificity determined using genetic models (Specific Aim 2).  Finally, Davisson's Ts65Dn mouse transformed research in DS but after 20 years, limitations in this and in fact in all mouse models have emerged. We will open a new era of investigation with a better model for behavioral and pharmacological testing by making a rat with a stably integrated copy of Hsa21 (Specific Aim 3).\",\n",
       " 'Abstract  Fluorescence imaging is used widely in almost all the biosciences. Examples include imaging of microscope slides with spots of DNA or proteins, multiplexed assays of classes of molecules like cytokines or capture immunoassays. Fluorescence occurs in all directions and it is necessary to collect as much of the emission as possible and to focus the emission onto a detector. The instruments for these measurements all contain multiple lens, mirrors and filters for directing the emission towards the detector. The optical components and principles have not changed in over 100 years. A modern microscope has the same shape and configuration as those over 100 years old. In contrast there has been enormous progress in electronics where the cost per GB of memory has decreased 1 million-fold.  We propose a widely applicable approach to fluorescence imaging that can provide high spatial resolution over large areas, easily up to the frame size of 35 mm film. This will be accomplished using Tamm structures which consist of multiple layers of dielectrics and a top metallic layer; which are called Tamm structures (TS). These structures contain no nanoscale features in the x-y plane and vapor deposition can produce large area structures at low cost. Tamm structures support optical modes which are perpendicular to the surface, and we have recently shown fluorophores close to the surface couple to these modes and also radiate perpendicular to the surface. In this project the Tamm structures will be placed directly onto CMOS imaging detectors (CID) for imaging. We refer to this method as coupled-emission microscopy (CEM). Practical CEM devices require improved z-axis confinement and reduced sample-to-detector distances.  We propose development of CEM to obtain a spatial resolution of 1 ?m or better. This will be accomplished by optical simulations and refined methods for preparation of Tamm structures and other multi- layer structures (MLS). Two independent methods will be used to test for improved z-axis confinement and improved coupling efficiency. Commercial CIDs contain protective cover slips which prevent close contact with the Tamm structures. Methods will be developed to place the TS directly onto the CID surface and for higher spatial resolution fabrication of the Tamm structure directly on the CID surface. Various methods of illumination and/or thin-film filters will be developed to reject incident light. Spatial resolution will be measured using fluorescent nanobeads (NBs) as point sources will also be used to determine the number of independent measurable locations. The effects of surface topology will be examined for effects on spatial resolution and sensitivity by increases in fluorophore-TS coupling efficiency. We will also examine alternative structures which are known to display perpendicular modes such as the three layer metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) structures and structures which do not contain any metal and display optical Tamm states (OTS). Replacement of even a small fraction of existing instruments with CEM devices would have a large impact on biology and medicine.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY The immune system plays a critical role in human health by sensing and destroying foreign invaders such as viruses, bacterium, parasites, and other sources of infection. Activating the immune response can help fight off a range of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and cancer. Conversely, inhibiting the immune response can help treat autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, and atherosclerosis. As such, there has been significant and growing interest in developing new therapeutics for regulating the immune response, both in stimulating or suppressing it, to treat a wide variety of human diseases. One particular area of interest lies in the development of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. TLRs are a well-studied family of pattern recognition receptors that stimulate the innate immune response when activated by the appropriate agonist. However, most TLR agonist-based therapeutics are not selective for which physiological regions are immunologically stimulated. TLR activity and the ensuing immune response may thus occur indiscriminately, leading to inflammation responses at undesired physiological sites, which can lead to disease exacerbation. Synthetically engineering the TLR agonist so that its primary release occurs specifically at disease sites may potentially increase immunotherapeutic potency while also reducing unwanted inflammation at healthy locations. The driving hypothesis of this proposal is to determine whether TLR agonists can be caged so that they are immunologically inactive until they detect specific bioanalytes, at which point they will self-immolate to release the free agonists and stimulate the immune response. The ability to cage and release TLR agonists was demonstrated previously by Esser-Kahn and coworkers, who utilized directed UV light to release TLR agonists and stimulate innate immune cells. We will use similar tools and metrics (NF-?B activity, cytokine and cell surface marker production, confocal microscopy) to characterize immune cell activation here, but exploit the local chemistry at the disease site to achieve higher specificity over uncaged therapeutics. The specific aims of this proposal that we will use to validate our hypothesis are to establish cage-and-release systems that are triggered by two specific bioanalytes: (a) the ferrous ion (Fe2+), and (b) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These bioanalytes were selected under the guiding principle that cancer cells contain severely elevated levels of both these species. However, our therapeutic strategy should be applicable to other disease states that involve dysregulated iron metabolism or generate high levels of H2O2. We will study the immune response in RAW- blue 264.7 macrophage reporters and primary dendritic cells that have been exposed to varying levels of Fe2+ and H2O2. Upon detecting these bioanalytes, the cage will fall apart and the immunotherapeutic payload will be released. If our hypothesis is validated, our findings may establish TLR agonists as therapeutics that can initiate immune responses at specific locations or under specific disease conditions (high levels of Fe2+ or H2O2), leading to enhanced cell-mediated immunity and enabling more potent and directed therapeutics.',\n",
       " \"Project summary/Abstract While cure rates for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved dramatically over the last several decades, ALL remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death in children. There continues to be an unmet need for effective therapies for patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), particularly those with relapsed or refractory disease. T-ALL is a disease generally responsive to drugs targeting metabolism, including methotrexate and asparaginase, which form the backbone of T-ALL therapy. Thus, I hypothesize that novel approaches to targeting metabolism may be particularly relevant in T-ALL. I screened a panel of leukemia cell lines against small-molecule inhibitors of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), enzymes of the mitochondrial one carbon folate pathway, and I discovered that T-ALL cells are highly sensitive to these inhibitors, more so than other leukemia cell lines. This proposal aims to use the small molecule inhibitors of MTHFD2 and SHMT2, as well as genetic suppression of these enzymes, in vitro and in vivo, to study the mechanistic role of SHMT2 and MTHFD2 in T-ALL pathogenesis. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop novel therapies for patients with T-ALL. I am a pediatric oncologist who is seeking K08 support for mentored time in Dr. Kimberly Stegmaier's laboratory at DFCI, with Dr. Matthew Vander Heiden at MIT as a co-mentor. My long-term career goal is to become an independent academic physician-scientist, using genomic and chemical approaches to identify metabolic vulnerabilities in acute leukemia with an eye toward therapeutic intervention. My prior research experiences have established my skills in functional genomics, molecular and cellular biology and drug testing applied to acute myeloid leukemia and T-ALL. I am now well positioned to establish the necessary expertise in cancer metabolism, translational medicine and developmental therapeutics through the critical mentored K08 award. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI)/Boston Children's Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard are internationally recognized research programs with a number of expert researchers in the areas of hematopoiesis, metabolism and cancer cell biology, among others. The DFCI Division of Pediatric Oncology has a distinguished record of training young physician- scientists for leadership roles in pediatric cancer research. I have assembled an excellent mentoring and advisory committee, consisting of Dr. Nika Danial, Dr. Jon Aster, and Dr. Lewis Silverman, who will guide my research and training experiences.

Our central hypothesis is that CKDu results from the combined effects of dehydration and exposure to nephrotoxins, due to enhanced reabsorption of nephrotoxins into the renal tubules during periods of recurrent dehydration. Access to a large population of sugarcane workers in cooperation with a major Guatemalan agribusiness will allow for a study that characterizes and determines the contribution of occupational and environmental risk factors and that also evaluates subclinical kidney responses using biomarkers of early biological change in CKDu. This research will: a) identify occupational, environmental, and lifestyle factors that place agricultural workers at risk for the development of CKDu by conducting robust environmental and biological exposure assessments and b) examine underlying mechanisms by which dehydration contributes to increased risk of CKDu in conjunction with nephrotoxic exposures. To address this hypothesis, two aims are proposed: Aim 1 focuses on identifying sources of nephrotoxic exposure and risk factors for renal damage in Guatemalan sugarcane workers, using prospective, quantitative environmental and biological exposure assessments. Aim 2 will evaluate biomarkers of effect, including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and copeptin as markers of early biological change, in order to identify workers with increased risk of worsening renal function. The proposed study is both case-control and prospective cohort in design. First, it will collect baseline questionnaire and clinical data and biological samples from individuals with either reduced kidney function (n=75) or normal kidney function (n=100) applying for field work employment at a sugarcane plantation in southwest Guatemala. In addition, individuals who have normal kidney function at the time of hire (n=100), will be monitored using repeat measurements at two additional time points spanning the 6-month sugarcane harvest. At these two time points, dehydration and heat stress, recognized risk factors, will also be measured in the workers. Within- and between-worker variation and magnitude of change will be assessed for selected urinary and blood biomarkers across the harvest. As a result of prior research, the specific nephrotoxic exposures to be evaluated will include non-steroidal anti- inflammatory medication use (diclofenac), tobacco use (cotinine), selected agrochemicals and heavy metals, and Leptospira. Water samples at the worksite will be collected and measured for nephrotoxic agrochemicals and heavy metals at the three collection time points. Results of this research will lead to large-scale intervention trials that will help to prevent CKDu in vulnerable populations, and to the broad dissemination of results internationally.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Acute inflammatory lung diseases affect over 450 million people worldwide each year. Pathologic hallmarks include neutrophil accumulation, alveolar epithelial and endothelial cell injury, and loss of epithelial-capillary integrity. For alveolar repair to occur, inflammation must be halted, debris and inflammatory cells removed, injured tissue cells replaced, and capillary barrier function re-established. Macrophages are key players in all of these. The primary objective of this proposal is to create a Program in Lung Macrophage Biology that will determine how lung macrophages are programmed to halt inflammation and promote alveolar repair. A concept at the heart of the proposal is that of macrophage subsets. During health, the airspaces are occupied by a stable population of resident alveolar macrophages (RAM) that arise during embryogenesis and self-renew throughout life. RAMs remain during inflammation but are joined by recruited macrophages (RecM) that mature from circulating monocytes. These RecM remain in the lungs until alveolar function is restored, and then in most cases undergo apoptosis. However, in certain situations RecM escape apoptosis. We have shown that this is associated with the development of fibrosis. The precise roles played by RAMs vs RecM in the resolution of inflammation and promotion of tissue repair remain largely unknown. However, our data suggest that their respective roles are very different. In this context, the Program in Lung Macrophage Biology will explore 3 complementary themes. Theme 1 tests the hypothesis that RecM apoptosis is essential for the resolution of inflammation and that delayed apoptosis leads to fibrosis. The mechanisms that regulate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway and the intracellular proteins that block it will be studied. Theme 2 tests the hypothesis that binding of airway-derived mucins to Siglecs (a class of sialic acid-binding receptors with immunoinhibitory function) expressed on macrophages calibrates macrophage inflammatory responses. Theme 3 provides a tight link with the other themes and explores how cellular metabolism regulates macrophage inflammatory and pro-reparative functions and how it regulates survival of macrophage subsets. In this context, we propose that RecM preferentially use glycolysis as an energy source, whereas RAMs have increased utilization of the TCA cycle. HIF-1a is stabilized in RecM and is viewed as a central metabolic regulator. The 3 themes are further linked by their focus on differential functions of RAM vs RecM, the utilization of fresh human macrophages and shared use of cutting edge technologies. The Program leverages a multidisciplinary team of highly accomplished investigators, novel transgenic animal systems that we have developed, and a strong clinical research component. The latter includes whole human lungs obtained from donors that died with ARDS, bronchoscopy specimens from patients with ARDS, and LPS exposure studies with healthy human volunteers.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY In this proposal, we plan to use a Complex Systems Biology approach to characterize the global microbiome and metabolome of various wounds over a longitudinal period of time. In addition, these global profiles will be integrated with an analysis of innate immune potential for activation. The research proposed here has the potential to uncover how the microbiome and innate immune responses influence the wound metabolic landscape and to generate insights into novel, low-cost therapeutic interventions that exploit microbial metabolic pathways or host cell metabolic immunomodulation changes. The ultimate goal is to develop evidence-based, medical countermeasure protocols that could be initiated in the clinic and followed by an outpatient population. By 2050, the American Diabetes Foundation predicts that one in three adults in the United States will have diabetes, correlating to a significant immunocompromised population and nearly 85 million patients subjected to loss of a limb as a result of a non-healing chronic wound. With this research, we will not only gain significant insight in to the basic biology of host-pathogen interactions within the chronic wound environment in diabetics, but will also lay the foundation for novel medical interventions predictive of wound healing.',\n",
       " 'The ability of small interfering RNAs and microRNAs to silence the expression of specific genes is among the major biomedical discoveries of the last two decades. However the difficulty of delivering sufficient doses of these labile, hydrophilic macromolecules to disease sites continues to hamper the practical application of RNA interference in medicine. Two key problems are that (i) RNAi therapeutics lack inherent permeability across cellular membrane barriers and (ii) that they are rapidly degraded in the extracellular environment. To address these issues the major existing strategy is to encapsulate RNAi agents within protective nanoparticles that contain cationic components. However, the inherent toxicity of existing delivery vectors have limited the translational capacity of this approach in applications requiring systemic delivery. In contrast, nature has provided an elegant solution for delivering RNAi agents without damaging cellular membranes ? siRNA transport through the cellular gap junction network. Specifically, hexameric connexin channels imbedded in the plasma membranes of adjacent cells come together to form gap junctions, direct passageways between the cytoplasm of a cell and its neighbors, which cells use to share diverse hydrophilic molecules including siRNA. Recently, we have developed novel delivery systems that can harness the potential of the gap junction network. Here we propose to develop RNAi loaded connectosomes, lipid membrane vesicles that incorporate a high concentration of connexin membrane channels, creating a direct passageway from the interior of the vesicle to the cellular interior. Preliminary work demonstrates that using our novel connectosomes to deliver small molecule chemotherapeutics increases the efficiency of tumor cell killing by 1000 fold in comparison to conventional liposomal delivery, results which illustrate the importance of direct access to the cell cytoplasm. Further, we have demonstrated loading of connectsomes with siRNA and the release of siRNA into the cell cytoplasm. These findings, coupled with the well-established role of gap junctions in natural RNAi delivery, suggest our hypothesis ? particles that access the gap junction network can substantially increase the efficiency of siRNA delivery. Two aims will develop siRNA-loaded connectosomes and test their efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo models of breast cancer. Aim 1 is to perform an in vitro optimization of connectosomes for siRNA delivery and gene knockdown. These studies will utilize quantitative measures of siRNA loading, release, and resulting gene knockdown. Then Aim 2 is to perform an in vivo evaluation of the anti-tumor efficacy of siRNA and chemotherapeutics delivered using connectosomes. These studies will utilize a breast tumor xenograft model in mice. Harnessing the gap junction network to circumvent the endosomal pathway for delivery of siRNA and microRNA is highly innovative and has the potential to provide an entirely new route for transport of these potent therapeutics into the cytoplasm. This fundamental conceptual innovation in RNAi delivery will allow us to increase the efficiency and reduce the toxicity of siRNA therapeutics, helping to realize their potential for treatment of diverse diseases.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive forms of reward seeking that support drug abuse and obesity exact an enormous toll on individual and economic health. A mounting body of preclinical and clinical work demonstrates that the endocannabinoid system powerfully regulates the motivational impact of rewards. While pharmacotherapies targeting endocannabinoid function to treat disordered reward seeking are efficacious, this approach has been hindered due to non-specific drug actions and unacceptable side effects. Here, I aim to identify mechanisms by which endocannabinoids regulate reward seeking through interactions with dopamine system function to identify precise neuronal targets for future cannabinoid-based therapies. I will test the hypothesis that synthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol by dopamine neurons is required for dopamine neurons to encode the incentive value of reward-predicting cues and motivate reward seeking. This work will employ two cutting-edge techniques, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and optogenetics, paired with conditional and inducible mutagenesis to selectively target the enzyme responsible for 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis within dopamine neurons. Our ability to target dopamine neuron function in real-time during behavior and manipulate specific elements of the endocannabinoid system will provide novel information concerning how endocannabinoid signaling motivates reward seeking, potentially enabling the development of more targeted pharmacotherapies.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Three major contributors to therapeutic resistance that have been difficult to overcome in pancreatic cancer (PDAC) are mutations in the KRAS oncogene, the presence of a dense desmoplastic stroma that acts as a barrier to drug delivery and effector immune cell infiltration, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that renders the tumor ineffective to immunotherapy. Our efforts at targeting downstream effectors of oncogenic RAS, have shown that MEK inhibition (MEKi) results in reciprocal activation of STAT3 signaling, which confers therapeutic resistance and continued PDAC cell growth. Combined inhibition of JAK/STAT3 (STAT3i) and MEKi overcomes therapeutic resistance following RAS inhibition that is mediated through parallel feedback loop activation. We have now identified a novel mechanism showing that combined MEKi and STAT3i also inhibits tumor fibrosis and enhances CD8+ cytotoxic T cell (CTL) infiltration to the tumor while downregulating immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the TME, resulting in reduced tumor burden and improved survival in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMs) of PDAC. In addition, we show that the tumor suppressive effects of MEKi and STAT3i are T cell dependent. This change in the TME, however, is accompanied by sustained PD-L1/PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression. Our preliminary results further show that combined MEKi and STAT3i with PD-1 inhibition can harness the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors for an enhanced anti-tumor response. Therapeutic strategies that reprogram the tumor stroma to activate T-cell anti-tumor immunity and reverse immune tolerance are of paramount importance as they have the potential to revolutionize treatment for pancreatic cancer and improve clinical outcomes.  Our central hypothesis is that MEKi and STAT3i will reprogram cellular components of the PDAC TME to stimulate infiltration of CD8+ CTLs and overcome the immunosuppressive milieu of PDAC to enhance the effects of checkpoint inhibition (CPI) for a durable and sustained anti-tumor response. This will be proven by the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine if checkpoint inhibition with MEKi and STAT3i will improve survival in GEMs of PDAC. Safety and efficacy of MEKi/STAT3i and anti-PD1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies treatment response will be determined in two different GEMs of PDAC. Aim 2: Determine if changes in the stromal and immune microenvironment induced by MEKi/STAT3i and checkpoint inhibition result in a durable and sustained anti-tumor immune response in PDAC in vivo. In this aim, multiplex flow cytometry will be used to detect the changes in the cell types and activation phenotypes to determine if the differences pre- and post-treatment predict response. Aim 3: Determine the effects of PDAC cell specific and CAFs specific knockdown of MEK and/or STAT3 signaling on changes in the stromal and immune microenvironment in PDAC. This aim will elucidate the mechanism of cell-specific knockdown of MEK and/or STAT3 mediated changes in that result in increased infiltration CD8+ T cells and suppression of suppressive MDSCs and Tregs. This work will not only evaluate a novel treatment strategy for PDAC, but may uncover potential biomarkers of response to checkpoint inhibitors.',\n",
       " 'William Hoffman, PhD, MD, PI: Neurobiology of Alcohol and Nicotine Co-Addiction OBJECTIVE: This proposal, Neurobiology of Alcohol and Nicotine Co-Addiction addresses the critical absence of information about the neurobiology of recovery from Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in alcohol (EtOH) and nicotine (NIC) using veterans. AUD and nicotine use disorder (NUD), almost entirely cigarette smoking, are the most commonly abused (non-prescription) substances in the U.S. Co-addiction is particularly high in military veterans. Although nationwide estimates peg the rate of AUD/NUD co-addiction at 80%, the Substance Abuse Treatment Program (SATP) at the Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS) finds that 90% of veterans treated for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) also meet criteria for Nicotine Use Disorder (NUD). PLAN: SA 1: Test a dual network model of alcohol and nicotine co-addiction via contrast of multiple neural aspects of AUD, NUD, NAUD and CS: a) task based (PDD) and stress modulated cue induced craving, b) volumetric estimates of cortical density (voxel-based morphometry [VBM], c) anatomical (diffusion tensor imaging [DTI] and d) resting state functional connectivity. SA 2: Develop a machine learning model that integrates behavioral, task and resting state functional activation, volumetric data and structural connectivity that a) differentiates the four groups and b) predicts treatment outcome at 3 months. METHODS: Four subject groups (Alcohol alone [AUD] alcohol plus smoking [NUD/AUD = NAUD], subjects who smoke [NUD] and never addicted controls [CS]) will be recruited from the Portland VA Health Care System (VAPORHCS). All will undergo a comprehensive evaluation at baseline including neuroimaging, cognitive testing, careful demographic and substance use history and laboratory evaluation. The AUD and AUD/NUD groups will be followed and re-evaluated with the entire battery at three months with monthly appointments to monitor progress. We hypothesize that a support vector machine learning algorithm will be able to use the measures to classify subjects as AUD, NUD both or neither and that the algorithm will predict outcome (sobriety or relapse) at 3 months. RELEVANCE TO THE VA MISSION: AUD and cigarette smoking are the most common addictive disorders in veterans and co-addiction is the rule. This proposal will disentangle the neurobiological correlates of single and co-addiction to these substances and develop a model that can help predict treatment response. Key words: Alcohol, nicotine, co-addiction, outcome',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Single-cell technologies have contributed to the understanding of underlying order in heterogenous samples, providing a platform to identify rare cell types with implications to human disease. These platforms are largely based on analyses of single-cell suspensions and do not provide a spatial context to the findings. It is becoming increasingly evident that the tissue architecture is a critical parameter and contributes significantly to the overall biological state of a sample. High-parameter imaging technologies enable the identification and localization of rare cell types in heterogenous tissue samples. Currently available high-parameter imaging technologies are time-consuming, limited in the number of parameters that can be reproducibly imaged and/or are cost-prohibitive for broad use in the scientific community. Akoya Biosciences Inc. has exclusively licensed a new high-parameter imaging technology termed CODEX (CO-Detection by indEXing) that is robust, inexpensive and can quickly acquire fluorescence data across tens of parameters. The CODEX platform consists of a set of specialized biologic reagents, including tagged antibody and oligo products, as well as a fluidics robot that can be attached to any inverted microscope. The broad applicability of this technology will enable any lab, ranging from small academic labs to large pharmaceutical research entities, to acquire high-parameter imaging data. These analyses will enable a deep understanding of disease mechanisms, therapeutic targets and overall tissue architecture. The goal of Akoya Biosciences Inc. is to commercialize this technology through the production of the fluidics robot as well as reagent kits for antibody staining and signal rendering. The current version of the technology was developed for the analysis of fresh-frozen (FF) tissue samples; however, most tissue samples are stored as formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE). The conditions for analyzing FF tissues using the CODEX platform do not result in effective antibody staining for FFPE tissues. The goal of the research outlined in this grant proposal is to develop conditions and methodologies that enable the analysis of FFPE tissues with the CODEX platform. This will increase the overall applicability of the technology and drastically increase the customer base for Akoya Biosciences Inc. We plan to use the information learned in this Phase SBIR I grant proposal to develop antibody panels validated for FFPE tissues that will be commercialized. This greater development effort will be the focus of a follow-on Phase II SBIR grant application.',\n",
       " \"VDI Project Summary/Abstract:   The NIH Division of Cell Biology and Biophysics supports studies of the biological macromolecules that affect the function and structure of living cells, and often play a role in disease. Within the realm of biophysics, one of the most important tools to study the structure and interactions of these molecules is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). For example, NMR has been used to study the oligomeric forms of amyloid-? that are that are critical to understanding the development of Alzheimer's disease. Also, NMR allows study of the structure of membrane proteins for use as potential pharmaceutical targets.  Cleary, NMR is an extremely powerful scientific tool, however, the technique is not simple and the measurements can be expensive and time consuming. This is primarily because the NMR signal is weak and requires sensitive receivers and long integration times for reliable detection. Within the field of NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a well-known technique to greatly increase the signal strength. Most DNP systems rely on a Gyrotron to generate the required microwave power. Although Gyrotrons generate sufficient power, they are incapable of generating the short pulses and modulated signals desired for advanced DNP systems. Also, their cost is prohibitive for all but the most well-funded laboratories.  The key focus of this project is to advance solid-state (SS) source technology to the point where it can begin to replace the Gyrotrons for a significant proportion of DNP-NMR measurements, thereby lowering the barriers to entry into this field and accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.  The Phase I effort is focused on demonstrating that recent technological innovations can be used to significantly increase the power and functionality of the SS sources for DNP. The first objective is to demonstrate an innovative frequency doubler design that is expected to generate greater than 200 mW at 263 GHz. This is a significant milestone not only because it will increase the range of measurements possible with a SS source, but also because it is sufficient to fully pump the emerging traveling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers, which can increase the power to the several watts. The second objective is to generate short pulses and complex waveforms with accurate phase and frequency modulation. This is an important milestone because such control of the microwave signal can significantly increase the NMR signal without requiring increased power. The final Phase I objective is to develop the general research plan for Phase II that will lead to watt level power at 263 GHz, extension of the technology to other frequencies of interest, and the implementation of the pulse and modulation controls into a system optimized for DNP- NMR research.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The 10-member sarcomeric myosin heavy chain gene family has been studied extensively and mutations in half of its members have been implicated in disease. Myosin motors convert chemical energy into mechanical force by amplifying the ATP-driven conformational rotation of myosin?s lever arm, which consists of a helical pliant region and the ?-helix of the heavy chain stabilized and stiffened by essential and regulatory light chains; hereafter referred to as the lever arm. While a great deal of study has been devoted to the catalytic domain and converter, the lever arm has often been treated as simply a semi-rigid extension of the converter to amplify the stroke size of the motor. For a given isoform of myosin the entire lever arm is highly conserved across species, but it is highly variant amongst the 10 isoforms, suggesting that the sequences of lever arm ?- helices confer specific functions. Given the high sequence conservation of the ?-cardiac lever arm across species and the high density of pathogenic mutations in it, we hypothesize that this region is an important regulatory domain that modulates myosin function and testing that hypothesis is the focus of this proposal. We propose an interdisciplinary collaboration among the Spudich, Perkins and Leinwand laboratories to study the effects of disease-causing mutations in the lever arm by integrating the biophysical characterization of isolated lever arms and myosin motor functional assays with cardiac cell biology. In the previous grant period, the Leinwand, Spudich and Geeves laboratories produced and characterized a number of disease-causing mutations of the human ?-cardiac myosin motor for their biochemical and kinetic properties, but none of these studies included lever arm mutations. Because of clinical hypercontractility of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients and hypocontractility of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients, we hypothesize that HCM mutations will most likely increase the stiffness of the lever arm, whereas, DCM mutations will cause the lever arm to be less stiff. In Aim I, we will determine the biochemical and mechanical properties of the lever arm of WT ?-myosin using atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the elasticity of proteins in addition to probing their folding/unfolding dynamics. Until now, AFM technology did not have the resolution to study the mechanics of the 9-nm long lever arm. However, the Perkins lab?s recent advances in single-molecule AFM techniques will enable us to compare the mechanical properties of the WT ÃŸ-cardiac myosin lever arm ?-helix to ones carrying cardiomyopathy-causing mutations. In Aim II, we will measure the impact of the lever arm mutations on in vitro subfragment-1 (S1) motor function using ATPase, gliding filament and optical tweezer assays. Finally, in Aim III we will integrate these biophysical and biomechanical findings into cells by introducing WT and lever arm mutant full length ?-cardiac myosins into cardiac myocytes and determining their effects on sarcomere integrity, sarcomere dynamics and contractility.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social cues, such as eye gaze, facial and bodily emotion, gender, appearance, have largely been studied independent of one another, often isolated within separate fields. Emotional expression, for example, has been most extensively studied within a social psychological framework, and facial identity largely within a visual cognition framework. Importantly, neither discipline adequately addresses the combined influences of various cues on social perception. This research takes an interdisciplinary, multi-method approach to this question. A conceptual merger is required now, one that focuses specifically on the intersection of social cues in perceptual processing. Because of shared social meanings across cues, we predict that compound social cues will lead to interactions in brain systems known to be important for social and emotion processing, such as the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and superior temporal sulcus. We also predict that under conditions of restricted awareness, responses will be preferentially attuned to congruent (i.e., clear) cues, whereas for conscious processing they will be preferentially attuned to incongruent (i.e., ambiguous) threat cues. Research examining the neurobiological underpinnings of affective perception is in its formative stages. In the current application, we contend that social and emotional messages inherently share meaning. If substantiated, the complexities of our nonverbal social language will be more tractable and clearly delineated, and the interplay of reflexive- versus conscious-level processing will be further elucidated. Notably, the brain regions of interest that will be examined have been implicated in the types of socio-emotional impairments that characterize such psychopathological disorders as autism, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and Turner's syndrome, as well as various forms of related brain lesions (e.g., temporal lobectomy). We specifically aim to make significant strides toward future work applying compound social cue theory to patient populations with anxiety disorders and deficits in socio-emotional perception related to the particular brain systems of interest.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The scientific theme of the proposed Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) is that molecular and genetic analysis of diseases that involve the skeleton will lead to a better understanding of their causes and will support development of novel therapies. Four research projects, each led by a junior investigator, will investigate different conditions that lead to damage of the musculoskeletal system. Each of these projects will employ high-throughput technologies to generate large datasets for genome-wide characterization of experimental samples. These datasets will contribute to deep molecular characterization and enable comprehensive monitoring of cellular processes and advance understanding of biological systems. However, the amount of data generated is vast, its dimensionality is high, and it is typically difficult to handle. Therefore, effective extraction of meaningful information from these datasets will require personnel with the appropriate expertise and access to the necessary computational facilities. To address these needs, we will establish a new Bioinformatics Core at UAMS for computational analyses of large data sets that assembles the personnel, equipment, and computational algorithms required to meet the needs of the Project Leaders and CMDR members (Aim 1). We will provide bioinformatics services to these investigators and develop customized new services to meet their evolving needs via custom bioinformatics analysis pipelines derived from up-to-date computational algorithms and biological knowledge databases that fit the needs of the specific research project (Aim 2). We will also provide training and education related to the use of bioinformatics so that Project Leaders and other users will be better able to understand and use the principles and concepts of bioinformatics methods related to their research subjects (Aim 3). The Bioinformatics Core will consist of personnel who have strong bioinformatics skills, appropriate biological knowledge, and experience working with biologists. The team will provide advanced bioinformatics/systems biology guidance and analyses at all stages of genome-wide experiments. Project Leaders and other CMDR members will acquire bioinformatic skills and expertise that will have long-term benefits for them individually and the Center as a whole. In the short- term, the Bioinformatics Core will enable Project Leaders to rapidly and efficiently integrate the results obtained from the other CMDR cores: the Genetic Models Core (Core B) and the Bone Histology and Imaging Core (Core C). In turn, bioinformatic analyses will prompt the creation of new genetic models and guide interpretation of imaging and histologic analyses. This iterative process will result in synergy that would be difficult to achieve without the coordinated leadership and access provided by the CMDR. Overall, access to the Bioinformatics Core's cutting-edge resources, and the critical mass of investigators that it supports, will greatly strengthen the research communities at UAMS and in Arkansas.\",\n",

The objective of the GABC is to enable the genomic and bioinformatics research goals of this COBRE application and to assist other investigators in obtaining and analyzing genomic data. The GABC will provide the following five services to COBRE investigators: (1) high throughput Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in support of RNA-Seq and other global genomic studies, (2) bioinformatic methods and analyses for NGS projects, (3) automated Sanger DNA sequencing and RNA/DNA quality assessment, (4) access to critical shared instruments including real-time thermal cyclers, Luminex 200 system, Protein Simple Fluorimeter and SpectraMax plate reader and (5) workshops on NGS and bioinformatic methods central to the COBRE research projects. The GABC business model includes a full-service plan of operation for provision of NGS and other genomic services to the COBRE investigators. We anticipate that our full service model will encourage COBRE and other investigators to adopt genomic approaches in their research and that these interactions will promote the growth of GABC and genomic research in West Virginia. The GABC will enable COBRE investigators to identify and characterize candidate pathways that help to explain the role of transporters in the development of obesity. Our strategic plan and centralized expertise will improve the efficiency of the research process in terms of improved access and reduced time and cost of genomic data analysis.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the years we have been characterizing mice with different Akt isoforms deficiencies for survival, lifespan, and susceptibility to cancer. The current renewal application is focused on new and unexpected observations made during the last funding period. These observations are: (i) Systemic whole body deletion of Akt1 in adult mice inhibits tumor progression in a mouse cancer model that is not driven by Akt activation. (ii) The deletion of either Akt1 or Akt2 does not inhibit liver carcinogenesis, and Akt2 deletion increases lung metastasis induced by liver carcinogenesis. (iii) The deletion of both Akt1 and Akt2 in the liver induces spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). (iv) Germ line deletion of Akt1 and Akt3 causes embryonic lethality, but the systemic deletion of Akt1 and Akt3 in adult mice is well tolerated. (v) The deletion of Akt1 increases the lifespan of mice. (iv) The systemic deletion of Akt1 and Akt2 in adult mice induces rapid mortality. These findings suggest that drugs, which target predominately Akt1 and not Akt2 could be effective and well tolerated in cancer therapy. By contrast, drugs that effectively inhibit both Akt1 and Akt2 could be deleterious and pro-liver carcinogenesis. Since Akt activation is perhaps the most frequently event occurring in human cancers, and targeting Akt activation for cancer therapy is in progress, our studies should have a profound impact on cancer therapy. The overall goal of this project is to determine the physiological consequences of Akt deletion in the mouse and their underlying mechanisms with implications to cancer therapy.',\n",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop Cardio Thoracic Events and Decompensated heart failure (INVESTED) I s a multi-center, randomized, double blind, active-control trial of high dose influenza vaccine compared to standard dose influenza vaccine for three seasons in adult participants with a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure. The primary outcome measure is the composite of death or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations, and secondary outcomes include composite of cardiopulmonary death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization, all-cause death or all-cause hospitalization, all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, cardiopulmonary death, and all cause death. Background: The substantial number of individuals in North America with myocardial infarction or heart failure (HF) are at high risk for influenza infection and associated morbidity, mortality and increased health care costs despite annual influenza vaccination. Higher dose of vaccine is approved for use in older adults but not in patients with heart failure. Antibody-mediated immunity contributes to vaccine-induced protection from influenza illness. Preliminary data: Our research group has shown in a meta-analysis that influenza vaccine reduces the risk for cardiovascular events and has also demonstrated reduced antibody titers to influenza vaccination in patients with HF. Additionally, we've shown in a pilot study that double dose influenza vaccine resulted in increased titers and was well tolerated. Methods: A multi-center, randomized, double blinded randomized trial will be conducted with 4650 patients assigned to the standard dose vaccine dose and 4650 patients to high dose influenza vaccine. The primary outcome measure is the composite of death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization, assessed at the end of each influenza season. Secondary outcomes will include the composite of death or cardiovascular hospitalizations, death or all-cause hospitalizations, and mortality. The study will also examine associations between geometric mean antibody titers and risk for death or cardiopulmonary hospitalizations. Significance: A positive trial may be able to provide crucial information to infom health care policy regarding optimal influenza vaccination dosing among individuals with high risk cardiovascular disease.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K24 application proposes a mentorship program in patient-oriented research in multi-level contributors to pediatric asthma health disparities, wih a focus on sleep and immune balance. The K24 Candidate is an Associate Professor (Research) in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, with a history of funding in behavioral interventions and longitudinal research aimed at improving asthma outcomes in urban children and addressing health disparities in pediatric asthma. Training Plan: The candidate will obtain additional training in asthma clinical immunology and sleep physiology, including state-of the art methods to assess immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep, and in-lab methods to assess sleep phenomenology through experimental approaches. Research Plan: The research proposed involves an innovative investigation of the effects of experimental sleep disruption on immune balance (Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio-Th1/Th2R; plasma IL-6 -pIL-6), and associated changes in asthma- related lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) and daytime performance in urban children with persistent asthma (8-10 years old). Forty children and their primary caregiver will each participate in a within-subjects protocol, with two experimental sleep conditions: baseline sleep (1 overnight, in-lab polysomnographic (PSG) sleep study), followed by sleep fragmentation (1 overnight, in-lab PSG). Prior to each condition, children will follow a 6-day sleep stabilization schedule at home. We will monitor sleep and lung function (FEV1 by spirometry) daily to confirm eligibility and adherence to sleep criteria, and assess asthma status. We include assessments of immune biomarkers and daytime performance following each condition. Results from this study ultimately will support the development of asthma and sleep interventions for urban and ethnically diverse children. Our data will elucidate how immune biomarkers relevant to asthma and sleep operate in relation to sleep disruption, and clinical indicators of worsening asthma (lung function), to identify those most at risk, prioritize intervention targets, and improve treatment response. Mentoring Plan: The proposed mentoring plan offers opportunities for mentorship of postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty with interests in POR. Mentees will be involved in ongoing longitudinal and intervention studies on pediatric asthma disparities, including the proposed research, which will focus on biological-based processes that contribute to asthma and sleep in urban children. A strong emphasis is placed on the recruitment and selection of minority mentees. This overall plan capitalizes on the rich resources and training opportunities available to postdoctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty at Brown Medical School, including several T32 fellowship programs, numerous junior faculty with K awards and small grants, a commitment to diversity in training, seminars in research design, ethics, and statistics, and an established infrastructure for evaluation.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human brain has a remarkable ability to flexibly allocate cognitive resources to meet task demands. Cognitive control machinery must maintain clear representation of current context (task demands), outcomes of prior choices, and control options for resolving conflict and adapting upcoming behavioral choices. Deficiencies in any of these operations can contribute to neuropsychiatric dysfunction.  Research to date identifies a network of areas, including the dACC, as essential to cognitive control. However, key aspects of cognitive control, including how network components interact, and how they represent and manage conflict, remain controversial. On a technical level, the wide gap between methods used in human and monkey studies raises a host of uncertainties, including the possibility of substantial interspecies differences in cognitive control machinery. We identify and target two major impediments to progress: 1) lack of a robust, yet specific conceptual framework that can integrate disparate empirical findings; and 2) lack of high quality human data spanning the scale from single neuron spikes to population activity.  We begin with an integrative conceptual model. The expected value of control (EVC) theory has recently been advanced to explain the role of the dACC in cognitive control. According to this model, the dACC weighs the expected benefit of successfully completing a control-demanding task against the cost required to do so. Based on this calculation, it generates a signal that specifies which (if any) task to perform, and how much control to allocate to the task. Specifically, the EVC model predicts that the dACC should perform the key functions mentioned at the outset: current context monitoring, outcome monitoring, and control signal specification. We test these functions with methods that effectively bridge the gap between single neuron activity in monkeys and noninvasive population measures in humans.  We propose a series of experiments using functional imaging and intracranial electrophysiology methods in humans. Subjects will be patients with medically intractable epilepsy scheduled for intracranial electrode implantation for seizure monitoring. Prior to electrode implantation, they will undergo high-resolution fMRI. While implanted, they will perform behavioral tasks designed to test hypotheses regarding the role of the dACC as predicted by EVC theory. We will collect simultaneous single-unit and LFP recordings from dACC and LFPs from lateral PFC.  Our broad goal is to validate a comprehensive theory of cognitive control using multi-modality human recordings. We do so by testing 3 Specific Aims aligned with the 3 proposed dACC functions mentioned above. In Specific Aim 1, we clarify the current context monitoring function of the dACC. We test hypotheses that the dACC encodes pure conflict signals, and that these neurons phase-lock to theta rhythms to coordinate dACC communication with other control-related regions. In Specific Aim 2, we define the outcome monitoring function of the dACC. We test hypotheses that human dACC neurons encode reward prediction errors (RPEs) and that these neurons entrain to theta oscillations to generate error- and feedback-related theta signals that can be observed on mid-frontal scalp EEG. Using information transfer analyses, we further hypothesize that RPE information travels from dACC to lateral PFC using theta-range oscillations. In Specific Aim 3, we establish evidence for a control specification function of the dACC. We test hypotheses investigating control signal targeting and intensity specification.  Many neuropsychiatric disorders are attributable to the inability to ascribe appropriate value to contextual stimuli, attend to relevant features while ignoring irrelevant ones, and sequentially increase or decrease reward contingencies of actions based on feedback. Examples of disorders of this process include mood/anxiety disorders (OCD, depression, affective aspects of chronic pain), addiction, attention deficit disorders, and psychoses. A clearer appreciation of the neurophysiology of human cognitive control will be essential for the successful understanding and treatment of these behavioral disorders.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  CRISPR-Cas9 is revolutionizing the life sciences through its RNA-guided ability to target individual genes for disruption or for precise editing. In addition to accelerating basic research and biotechnology, Cas9 and its RNA guides also have the potential to transform the treatment of inherited diseases via genome editing-based cures, especially if delivery hurdles can be overcome and clinical safety can be proven. There are three subtypes of Cas9 systems (Types II-A, -B and -C), and all three have yielded Cas9 orthologs with demonstrated utility in mammalian genome editing. Our own work has established the Type II-C Cas9 from N. meningitidis (NmeCas9) as a compact, naturally hyperaccurate genome editing platform. Some of the safety concerns in Cas9?s clinical development arise from Cas9 activity that is excessive, prolonged, or present in unintended cell types. These concerns have been heightened by a shortage of effective tools that inactivate Cas9 proteins after completion of the intended editing, or that prevent Cas9 activity altogether at undesired times or in unintended tissues.  We recently discovered natural Cas9 inhibitors [anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins] that evolved as counter- measures against CRISPR immunity. We have identified and validated five distinct families of Acrs from bacterial species with Type II-C CRISPR-Cas systems, and established their efficacy as off-switches for NmeCas9 genome editing in human cells. Our proven strategies have also led us to additional Acr candidates that are likely inhibitors of distinct Type II-C Cas9 orthologs. Our discoveries therefore provide us with a powerful entrÃ©e into addressing the limitations and safety concerns that arise from uncontrolled or otherwise unwanted Cas9 activity.  In this proposal, we outline experiments that exploit our discovery of Cas9 inhibitors in three ways. In Aim 1, we will use Acr phylogenetic distributions as pointers towards orthologous, robust, compact Type II-C Cas9 genome-editing systems, each of which would be immediately amenable to off-switch control. Because distinct Cas9s often have novel targeting specificities, this work also promises to expand the genomic scope of Cas9 editing. In Aim 2, we will optimize Acr inhibitory potency, and test the hypothesis that Acrs can be used to increase the efficiency of precise editing via homology-dependent repair. Finally, in Aim 3, we will establish tissue-specific Acr control over genome editing in a model mammal (the mouse), and use it to develop a flexible platform for restricting Cas9 genome editing to a single desired tissue following systemic Cas9 delivery by adeno-associated virus. Our strategy for enforcing tissue specificity of gene editing will be applicable even to cell types in which AAV-compatible tissue-specific promoters are unavailable for driving Cas9 expression.  The proposed research promises to yield enhanced genome-editing systems with broader targeting range, fewer safety risks and improved tissue specificity, which we will demonstrate pre-clinically in mice.',\n",
       " \"SUMMARY The unifying postulate of this P01 proposal is that comparative studies of KSHV, EBV, and MHV68 will accelerate the discovery of pathways regulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that contribute to gammaherpesvirus latency and tumorigenesis. Specifically, we hypothesize A) that herpesviruses utilize lncRNAs to regulate both virus and host gene expression, and B) that viral lncRNAs and/or virus-perturbed host lncRNAs directly contribute to the genesis of virus-associated AIDS malignancies. To address these hypotheses we propose three highly integrated projects with the goal of functionally analyzing lncRNAs and their mechanisms of action. Project 1, led by Dr. Renne (University of Florida, UF), will investigate KSHV- encoded lncRNAs and alteration of host lncRNA expression in the context of HIV-associated KSHV malignancies. Project 2, led by Dr. Flemington (Tulane University) will interrogate Epstein-Barr virus lncRNAs and alteration of host lncRNA expression in the context of HIV-associated EBV malignancies. Project 3 led by Dr. Tibbetts (UF) will investigate function of MHV68 lncRNAs and alteration of host lncRNAs in the context of latency and lymphomagenesis in a facile murine model. Importantly, all projects are supported by strong novel preliminary data, including the discovery of new gammaherpesvirus lncRNAs using a novel multi-platform genomics approach and implicating some of these lncRNAs in viral biology and pathogenesis. The well- organized Administrative core (Core A, Core Leader: Rolf Renne) will maintain oversight and organization of the program, including biostatisical consultation and adherence to reproducibility and transparency standards. Two additional service cores, which are already established and very productive, will support sequencing, bioinformatics and recombinant virus generation needs across the three projects: The Virus RNA-seq and Bioinformatics Core will be maintained at Tulane University (Core B, Core Leader: Erik Flemington). The Recombinant Virus Core, which was established with an NCI-funded RC2 award in 2009, will be maintained at UF (Core C, Core Leader: Rolf Renne). In addition, Dr. Parsons (LSUHSC, New Orleans), who leads the NIH- supported LSUHSC/LCRC HIV Clinical and Biospecimen Repository, will facilitate the acquisition of valuable Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and lymphoma tumor specimens from HIV-infected patients. Our proposal is significant and highly innovative in terms of the field of study ? ?understanding virus and host lncRNA function in gammaherpesvirus tumorigenesis? ? and in applying numerous state-of-the-art techniques across all three projects. Finally, studying pathogenesis-relevant tissue culture and animal models, complemented by the analysis of human tumor tissues from EBV- and KSHV-associated malignancies, will greatly increase our understanding of both viral and host lncRNAs in the context of AIDS malignancies.\",\n",
       " \"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, disabling condition that occurs in a subgroup of individuals after experiencing traumatic stress, and is common in Veterans seeking mental health treatment at the VA. Although evidence-based psychosocial treatments exist for PTSD, a substantial portion of individuals do not fully respond to treatment. Thus, there is a clear need to continue researching novel interventions for PTSD in Veterans. Recently, new interventions for mental health disorders have utilized computerized cognitive training techniques in order to improve the functioning of cognitive systems and reduce symptoms. This type of intervention, often referred to as neurotherapeutics, may hold promise for PTSD as a method for ameliorating symptoms and improving cognition. Individuals with PTSD demonstrate difficulties with cognitive control functions, which appear to be causally implicated in symptoms of the disorder (e.g., intrusive trauma- related memories). To date the efficacy of neurotherapeutics for PTSD has been understudied in Veterans.  The current proposal aims to bridge research on basic neurocognitive mechanisms of PTSD with intervention research by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a cognitive control training program in 80 Veterans with PTSD. Veterans will complete computer-based training exercises designed to specifically target and improve aspects of cognitive control. Veterans will complete the program twice per week for eight weeks. Symptoms will be assessed before and after treatment, as well as at a two- month follow up time point. The primary goal of the study is to examine the effect of the intervention on PTSD symptoms and cognitive deficits. Evaluating symptom change as a result of the intervention will provide critical data regarding the utility of this program as a PTSD treatment. If effective, this training program could serve as alternative treatment option for Veterans with PTSD, and could be translated into an easily transportable intervention for dissemination (e.g., through web-based platforms). A secondary goal is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to better understand the mechanisms by which cognitive training culminates in symptom reduction. If training cognitive control with neurotherapeutics directly enhances functioning of specific neural substrates as hypothesized, improvements in affective processes relying on shared neural regions would also be predicted. Modifying functioning in these substrates with training may thus reduce symptoms by improving neural functioning while processing and managing trauma-related affect and information. Neural systems used for cognitive control targeted in the training described (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC]) are also recruited when individuals mentally manipulate emotional information, such as when individuals use reappraisal to change the way that they think about negative emotional situations or content. In this study, Veterans will complete a neutral cognitive control task and a reappraisal task while undergoing fMRI before and after completing the training treatment. This will be the first study to evaluate neurobiological mechanisms of this type of training in PTSD, which is a fundamental next step for understanding how to improve the training program and who may be best served by completing it.  Building upon the applicant's prior experience with clinical trials and cognitive training research, the proposed training plan provides an opportunity for new hands-on training in neuropsychology, cognitive rehabilitation, and functional neuroimaging techniques to meet the immediate goal of developing skills in these domains. Long term, the award will facilitate development of expertise with integration of neurobiological tools with intervention research, and provide critical pilot data for successful preparation of a VA Merit Award. Together, the research and training plan will make the applicant well-poised to transition to an independent clinical scientist role within the VA system.\",\n",
       " 'This investigation tests the hypothesis that military occupation-specific exposures to silica and other inorganic dusts are associated with the prospective development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other rheumatic autoimmune diseases. There is ample support for this hypothesis from studies of civilian populations exposed to silica and other inorganic dusts, but this has never been studied in the military occupational context. The overarching Study Aim is to estimate the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other rheumatic diseases associated with military service exposure to inorganic dust using an established roster of OEF/OIF/OND veterans who have had any Veterans Administration Health Care System (VAHCS) contact. We will define exposure by linking categorized (coded) military duties to a job exposure matrix developed for this study. The disease outcomes of interest will be defined by VAHCS visits coded for RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and selected additional rheumatologic autoimmune conditions (such as systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, and vasculitis). Further diagnosis refinement will be supplemented by serologic data and natural language-based algorithms. We will analyze time until initial diagnosis for each target condition (Proportionate Hazards modeling) to estimate the risk of disease associated with military occupational exposure. We will adjust for key covariates, including sex, age, smoking, duration of service, and branch of service. We will limit study eligibility to full active duty military personnel (Reserve duty and National Guard members will not be included to better categorize exposure). After additional exclusions, we anticipate a cohort for analysis of 600,000 persons with approximately 2.4 million person years of VAHCS patient visits. Of the cohort, 25% will have had occupational assignments of higher; 18%, intermediate; and 57%, negligible exposure likelihood. In a preliminary logistic regression analysis in a subset of the cohort using RA as the outcome, we observed a 38% increased exposure-associated odds of disease (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.05-1.80). Based on these data, we conservatively estimate that we will have sufficient study power (alpha 0.05; beta 0.20) to detect exposure-related increase risk as low as 1.3 for RA and below 1.5 for SLE. RA, SLE, and other autoimmune rheumatic diseases within the population served by the VAHCS are well recognized as an important source of morbidity. It is now well established that inorganic dust inhalation is a factor consistently associated with increased risk of such diseases among civilian populations. Yet these two independent and important phenomena never have been considered in relation to one another. In short, the question has not been asked, can military service itself be a contributor to such diseases? The answer to this question is critical to risk reduction, case identification, effective treatment, and potentially, and primary prevention.',\n",
       " \"Aberrant signal transduction resulting from dysregulated phosphorylation is a hallmark of human cancer. Targeted cancer therapies are predominantly inhibitors of oncogenic kinases. While these drugs have had some clinical success, an alternative approach ? inactivation of kinase signaling by stimulating endogenous phosphatases ? has received minimal attention. Recently, our group has developed a novel series of small molecule activators of the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a negative regulator of multiple oncogenic signaling proteins, as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancers. PP2A is a heterotrimeric complex whose substrate specificity is dependent on one of 23 different regulatory subunits that can bind to form over 60 distinct holoenzyme complexes. Broad inhibition of holoenzyme formation using specific PP2A inhibitors, specifically the overexpression of the small T antigen of the SV40 tumor virus, renders cells resistant to SMAP therapy. This suggests that the formation of PP2A trimeric complexes is necessary for SMAP activity. However, from these studies the specific role of individual regulatory subunits in regulating the biological effects of SMAP activation of PP2A remains unclear. Preliminary data generated by targeted knockdown of a series of PP2A regulatory subunits demonstrated that specific subunit knockdown of PR72 attenuated SMAP activity in both cellular and in vivo models systems. Specifically, targeted reduction of PR72 but not B55 and B56 regulatory subunit family members resulted in blunted induction of PARP cleavage in SMAP treated cells. Additionally, stable PR72 knockdown resulted in abrogation of SMAP activity in a H358 xenograft model. Collectively, this data suggests that the PR72 regulatory subunit plays a critical role in small molecule mediated activation of PP2A's tumor suppressive activity. Here we propose to test the role of a single PP2A regulatory subunit, PR72, in mediating PP2A-dependent apoptosis using gain and loss of function experiments. The three interconnected specific aims are specifically directed at (1) determining the dependence on PR72 for PP2A-mediated cell death, (2) determining the signaling events regulated by the PR72 holoenzymes, and (3) defining the effect of SMAP binding to PP2A on PR72 holoenzyme stability.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Glioblastomas (GBMs), the most common and deadly primary malignant brain tumors, frequently display mutations that activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the Pi-3 kinase-Akt (PI3K) signaling pathway. Yet, to date, drugs that directly inhibit RTK and/or PI3K signaling have proven ineffective in treatment of GBM. Our research program uses complementary experimental model systems, including patient-derived primary GBM stem cell cultures and novel GBM models in Drosophila melanogaster, to identify and interrogate genetic and cellular processes that underlie glial tumorigenesis. Using our GBM model systems, we identified RIOK2, a highly conserved atypical serine-threonine kinase, and our results revealed that, in GBMs, RIOK2 becomes overexpressed in response to RTK-PI3K signaling to drive tumor cell proliferation and survival, and that RIOK2 knockdown in RTK-PI3K dependent GBM cells inhibits proliferation and elicits apoptosis. Our preliminary data also indicate that, in both Drosophila and human GBM models, inhibition of RIOK2 catalytic activity strongly counteracts RTK-PI3K-driven transformation. In contrast, loss or inhibition of RIOK2 activity in normal human or Drosophila glial progenitor/stem cells does not elicit cell death and does not dramatically affect cell proliferation. Thus, RTK-PI3K mutant tumor cells, but not normal glial cells, are dependent on RIOK2 activity for their growth and survival. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that RIOK2 drives GBM by phosphorylating and activating RNA-binding proteins to promote the translation of oncogenic target mRNAs, and that RIOK2 differentially promotes the growth and survival of GBM cells by stimulating the translation of oncogenic mRNAs that are expressed as a consequence of gliomagenic RTK and PI3K signaling. This proposal focuses two aims designed to Aim 1) Determine the mechanisms of interaction between RIOK2 and its associated RNA-binding proteins, and Aim 2) Determine if RIOK2 activity specifically promotes translation of select target mRNAs in tumor cells. This project may reveal new mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis, and establish a basis for developing RIOK2 inhibitors for potential targeted treatment for GBM.',\n",
       " 'Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic mental illness with high rates of relapse. BD is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder, especially in veterans. More than 130,000 veterans in the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system have been seeking treatment for BD. Individuals suffering with BD are likely to have diminished quality of life due to characteristics of symptoms which manifest as a result of the disorder. Suicide is a major concern within the VA healthcare system, and veterans suffering with BD are at high risk for committing suicide.  Despite the prevalence of BD and widespread research efforts, its pathophysiology remains complicated and obscure. Although various therapeutic modalities have been developed, about one third of BD patients have demonstrated an inadequate response to treatment. There exists a critical need to bridge the gap between neurobiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations of BD. Past research has shown magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in patients with BD to be an effective approach to learn more about the nature of BD.  Oxidative stress induced by neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated as a potent cause of BD based on ample prior research. Moreover, it has been reported that oxidative stress could be aggravated by hypobaric hypoxia at altitude. This may result in an increased suicide rate in BD above 2,000 feet altitude according to several recent publications. Additionally, there are animal studies supporting altitude?s effects on BD. Rats exposed to simulated hypobaric hypoxia exhibited brain chemistry similar to that seen in individuals with BD, in addition to demonstrating increased depressive behavior.  In our recent study, we found a difference in the brain chemistry of subjects living in moderate altitude compared to those living at low altitude (sea level); however, we found no difference in bioenergetic metabolites between BD subjects and healthy controls. In this proposed study, we will compare the difference in how veterans with BD compare to healthy controls in how their brains compensate for the shortage of energy enduring hypoxic conditions using MRS techniques. A total number of 88 subjects are planned for recruitment: 44 veterans with BD and 44 healthy controls. All subjects will undergo MRS brain scans to measure brain bioenergetics (phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphates levels) in breathing 16% and 25% oxygen concentrations (equal to oxygen at 10,000 feet and sea level, respectively).  It is hypothesized that coping with decreased energy production as a result of hypoxia may be less efficient in the subjects with BD, relative to healthy controls. The anticipated results of the current proposed study will elucidate the oxidative stress in BD and suggest new therapeutic targets for BD.',\n",
       " 'Preterm birth, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction are major causes of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. There is increasing evidence that dysregulation of placental function is associated with these disorders, and that the pathologic processes leading to them long precede their clinical manifestations. Therefore, the ability to accurately, rapidly, and safely detect various forms of placental dysfunction early in pregnancy may enable discovery and clinical use of novel biomarkers of pregnancy complications. Currently available strategies for prediction of these adverse pregnancy outcomes suffer from low sensitivity and specificity and/or are unfeasible for broad implementation, due to the need for expensive equipment, specialized expertise, or long turnaround times. This project aims to develop a magnetic nanosensor-based platform for measurement of analytes in the maternal blood that reflect placental function, which can be used to discover novel predictive biomarkers and make them universally available. The project team includes the expertise in maternal fetal medicine (Dr. Laurent), biomarker discovery (Drs. Laurent and Boniface), assay design (Drs. Lo and Boniface), and biosensors and instrument design (Drs. Hall and Lo). Aim 1 will focus on development of a magnetic immunoassays (MIAs) targeting known biomarkers of placental function (PAPP-A, ?HCG, AFP, INHA, sFLT and PLGF) and two novel analytes from a clinical mass-spectrometry-based assay for prediction of spontaneous preterm birth developed by Sera Prognostics (IGFBP4 and SHBG), and validation of these MIAs against existing clinical ELISA- and mass spectrometry-based tests. Aim 2 will include development, testing, and validation of magnetic nanosensor-based miRNA assays (MamiRAs), which will be adapted from a highly sensitive and specific optical PCR-free miRNA assay developed by the Lo group. Replacing the fluorescent quantum dots in the optical assay with magnetic nanoparticles will enable the MamiRAs to be read on the same device as the MIAs for proteins. After initial proof-of-concept studies, we will develop MamiRAs that interrogate a novel set of 21 miRNAs in maternal serum that Dr. Laurent has found to be highly predictive of placental dysfunction. If successful, this project will produce a versatile magnetic nanosensor-based platform for sensitive and specific quantification of a variety of analyte types, which will not only enable development of novel strategies for management and treatment of pregnancy complications, but can also be applied to other clinical and biological systems. Moreover, the platform is amenable to miniaturization, which will enable clinical tests to be performed at the point-of-care, allowing the treating physician to have immediate access to the test results, and enabling testing, interpretation and management/treatment recommendations to be done at the same clinic visit. The ability to test and treat in the same visit will improve the efficiency of the system and eliminate the risk of delayed treatment or loss-to-followup.',\n",

       " 'Summary: Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide and is linked to a variety of co- morbidities including Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), and Obesity. Work over the last 20 years by our group and others have identified the Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor (AT2R) as a key player in the development and pathogenesis of cardiac and vascular structural damage. Clinically, in men, loss of Agtr2 expression is associated with increased arterial stiffness, impaired kidney function, and increased pulse pressure. Literature shows that female-specific increase in AT2R expression protects murine female models from vascular injury. Healthy female (ZL-F) rats have higher cardiac expression of the X-linked Agtr2 compared to male (ZL-M) rats; but T2DM suppressed cardiac Agtr2 expression only in ZDF-F (female), not in ZDF-M (male). We posit that increasing Agtr2 expression in ZDF-F rat heart will render protection from cardiomyocyte loss and scarring and this treatment will be of particular benefit to women suffering from CVD. However, there are no AT2R agonists that can increase Agtr2 expression. We observed that NP-6A4, a novel peptide agonist of AT2R, could increase Agtr2 expression in rat and human CV cells and mitigate cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and capillary rarefaction in male Zucker obese rats. Our conceptually novel central hypothesis is based on these observations and states that NP-6A4-AT2R-signaling offers a new therapeutic approach to mitigate sex differences in CVD by increasing Agtr2 gene expression. We discovered two new cross-talks induced by NP- 6A4-AT2R; first is activation of ALK2-ALK1 pathway that mitigates capillary rarefaction, and the second is suppression of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) involved in pathological CV remodeling. In Aim 1, we will validate our hypothesis that NP-6A4 improves structural and functional cardiac and vascular parameters in rat models with chronic CVD induced by T2DM via increasing Agtr2 expression and signaling. We will use our new methods of detecting subclinical damage and subsequent protective remodeling via speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) in combination with histopathology, and extensive molecular signaling approaches. In Aim 2, we will investigate if NP-6A4 mitigates cardiac and vascular structural damage caused by acute mechanical- and drug-induced injury. We will also investigate a) the role of cross-talk between NP-6A4-AT2R and the Activin-like kinases (ALK2-ALK1 pathway) in improving capillary density, and b) the significance of the cross-talk between NP-6A4-AT2R and MR in mitigating pathological cardiovascular remodeling. Collectively, positive results of this study will have high clinical relevance since they validate a) the efficacy of NP-6A4 as a novel therapeutic for acute and chronic CVD, and for mitigating sex differences in CVD, and b) the efficacy of STE-based diagnosis of the progression and mitigation of T2DM-induced subclinical cardiovascular damage.',\n",
       " \"Project Title: Syphilis in Chicago: Epidemiology, Sexual Networking and Modeling for Prevention ABSTRACT The incidence of syphilis has been increasing in the US for at least 10 years, especially among men who have sex with men (MSM). Syphilis seroprevalence is higher among HIV-infected MSM, an indicator of condomless sexual contact and associated with incident HIV infection. Chicago is one of the major epicenters of the syphilis epidemic and includes the largest contiguous African American population in the United States.

The study, STI Chicago Epidemiology Network Study (SCENES), will enroll 150 high-risk MSM using a recently developed two-step (2S) network recruitment approach in three of Chicago's highest prevalence neighborhoods and monitor them quarterly for 2 years for incident syphilis and other STIs including HIV. We will collect detailed social and sexual network, and risk behavior data and create a syphilis transmission model that is built upon our existing MSM agent-based HIV transmission model platform to incorporate detailed sexual network dynamics, syphilis treatment and reinfection.

       " 'Project Summary Application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to the flow analysis and design of complex medical devices such as prosthetic heart valves and ventricular assist devices is by now standard practice in the medical devices research and development community. However, a recent controlled study by the FDA has demonstrated the limitations of traditional CFD in predicting laminar-transitional-turbulent flows of relevance to cardiovascular devices. In particular, no statistical turbulence model used in the medical devices community benchmarked uniformly successfully against experimental data. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) was recommended in this study for future simulations. To address the recommendation of the FDA panel to use LES in future simulations we propose to develop an advanced new-generation CFD for low-Reynolds-number turbulent flows of relevance to the NIH mission, using (1) a high-order Eulerian vorticity transport method for LES in the boundary layer region, and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) in the immediate vicinity of the boundary; and (2) an existing meshless Lagrangian Vortex Method (LVM) for LES of the large scale flow away from the boundary layer. The velocity evaluations, which constitute roughly 80% of the computational cost, will be parallelized on multicore CPUs and multi-GPUs. The Specific Aims of the project are: Specific Aim 1: To develop a compact high-order finite volume method for laminar flow simulation via the vorticity transport equation (VTE); to accelerate the velocity evaluations on multicore CPUs and multi-GPUs; and to rigorously validate the laminar flow code using, among others, the FDA Critical Path problem #1 (nozzle), as well as DNS of steady and pulsatile stenotic flow. Specific Aim 2: To develop a dynamic Subgrid-Scale (SGS) model in the context of VTE and tailored for transitional flow; and to validate the high-order finite volume code for turbulent flow using, among others, the FDA Critical Path problem #1 (nozzle), as well as steady and pulsatile stenotic flow. Specific Aim 3: To finalize the development of the proposed hybrid code for LES of low-Reynolds-number turbulent flow by coupling the high-order Eulerian and Lagrangian vortex element solvers, accurately and stably; and to validate the final product using a series of benchmarks, including the FDA Critical Path problems #1 (nozzle) and #2 (pump), as well as an actual blood pump; e.g., the HeartMate II. Specific Aim 4: To implement a system for successful documentation, dissemination, and maintenance of the software, and to accommodate collaborative research; and to develop interfaces to mainstream CFD to ensure interoperability and seamless migration to the propsed technology. Long-Term Impact: At present, application of traditional CFD and statistical turbulence models is limited to the study of device performance in terms of relative trends. That is, CFD is not yet a truly predictive design and analysis tool, at least in the case of cardio-device design, which involves highly complex unsteady flow with multiple coexisting laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow regimes. The proposed high-order hybrid DNS-LES method is designed to be a predictive tool that avoids ad hoc model constants especially within the boundary layer, which is a key source of shear stress and blood damage. The proposed technology will fundamentally alter how the medical devices community will use CFD in future. The long-term significant impact of this research and technology maturation project is a CFD software that (1) is incredibly easy to learn and use, as it obviates the often tedious and error prone volumetric meshing process; (2) can be used reliably as a predictive tool thanks to the absence of turbulence models with ad hoc fudge factors, which must invariably be calibrated and validated for each new flow problem; and (3) can be run on a desktop at order-of-magnitude faster turn-around times, reducing month-long product design cycles to just days, thanks to advanced algorithms and accelerated computing on commodity multicore CPUs and multi-GPUs.',\n",
       " \"Abstract: Opportunistic infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality of AIDS patients in developing countries and AIDS patients are susceptible to a number of cancers caused by opportunistic infections. Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is the most common tumor of AIDS patients and is the most commonly reported tumor overall in parts of Africa. The etiologic agent of KS is Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV-8). KSHV is invariably found in the main KS tumor cell, the spindle cell, a cell of endothelial origin, where the virus is present predominantly in the latent state. Spindle cells express markers of lymphatic endothelial cells and appear to be most closely aligned with this endothelial cells type. While KSHV is clearly an oncogenic virus, little is known about the early steps of how KSHV infection of endothelial cells leads to tumors. It is generally recognized that one of the early steps of tumor formation is immortalization of cells. There are two main steps in immortalization of human cells, senescence and crisis. While there have been studies that have examined KSHV Induced immortalization and transformation, no clear tractable and reliable relevant human cell system has be identified. We recently found that KSHV infection of primary neonatal lymphatic endothelial cells leads to bypass of senescence, the first step in immortalization. This proposal will further analyze the KSHV mediated bypass of senescence and determine if KSHV can drive full immortalization or if other genetic steps are necessary. Both the cellular and viral mechanism of KSHV mediated immortalization of lymphatic endothelial cells will also be elucidated. These studies provide a robust system for analyzing KSHV mediated immortalization of the cell type most closely related to the main KS tumor cell, the spindle cell. A deeper understanding of how KSHV induces the earliest steps in immortalization will help identify how KSHV alters endothelial cells to become spindle cells and ultimately KS tumors and potentially provides novel therapeutic avenues for KS cell proliferation.\",\n",
       " \"Project Summary Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in the human immune response to infection and malignancy. How these cells effectively distinguish between diseased and healthy tissue is one of the key unsolved problems in immunology today. The proposed work seeks to identify the mechanism(s) by which the small adaptor protein CT10 regulator of kinase (Crk), and its phosphorylation, control NK cell activation and inhibition by using both human NK cells and novel NK cell-specific conditional knockout mice. The long-term goal is to use this knowledge and the novel imaging techniques developed herein to uncover the molecular basis of NK cell activation and inhibition, and to develop new treatments for human primary immunodeficiency diseases and chronic diseases such as cancer and viral infection. NK cells kill target cells through the polarized release of lytic granules through a specialized region of cell-cell contact known as the immunological synapse (IS). Through previous studies of the cytotoxic (Liu, D. et al., Immunity, 2009, Cover Article) and inhibitory (Liu, D. et al., Immunity, 2012) IS, we discovered that Crk plays an essential upstream role at the IS, influencing signaling events required for both activation and inhibition. The molecular mechanisms underlying this dual role, however, remain unclear. We hypothesize that receptor-driven, integrin-influenced phosphorylation of Crk acts as a molecular switch, driving a conformational change, which in turn determines Crk's ability to interact with critical downstream signaling molecules and ultimately shapes the actin cytoskeleton into a functional IS. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test these hypotheses via three Specific Aims: 1) Define the precise molecular mechanisms by which Crk-like (CrkL) protein controls NK cell activation and inhibition. The proposed work will bring cutting-edge single molecule imaging technology to the field of NK cell research. Experiments will determine where and when Crk is phosphorylated at the IS, as well as how it interacts with key receptors, signaling molecules, and the actin cytoskeleton; 2) Determine the role of CrkL in NK cells from patients with partial DiGeorge syndrome (pDGS). By studying one of the most common (1 in 3,000 births) immunodeficiency diseases, pDGS (mainly caused by CrkL haploinsufficiency), we will determine how loss of CrkL function affects NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity; 3) Determine whether Crk or CrkL is required for NK function in vivo. Leveraging novel NK cell-specific Crk knockout mice that we have already generated, we will determine Crk's in vivo roles in NK cell-mediated immune responses to viral infection and cancer, including a newly identified role in memory NK cell generation. The proposed work involves key signaling players and regulatory mechanisms and generates a novel model system in which to determine Crk's role as a master regulatory molecule. It is broadly relevant with direct clinical implications for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases, viral infections, and cancer. !\",\n",
       " 'Molecular processes that underlie the induction and consolidation of long-term memory (LTM) are the subjects of intensive research, and studies are providing a wealth of empirical data that relate aspects of memory to specific intracellular signaling pathways. For example, empirical studies are elucidating the roles played by extracellular factors (e.g. growth factors), kinase activity, and transcriptional regulation in induction and consolidation of memory. Due in part to the complexity and nonlinear features of these molecular pathways, it is difficult to develop an intuitive understanding of the ways in which these pathways respond to stimulus protocols or pharmacological manipulations or are affected by single-site molecular lesions. To provide a better understanding of the processes underlying LTM, the present proposal will develop quantitative models of the molecular pathways that underlie two well-characterized models of LTM: i) long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) and ii) long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). Parameters will be constrained by empirical data. Parameter sensitivity analysis and a novel cluster analysis will assess model robustness. Aim 1 will extend our model for LTF, which describes the regulation of transcription by PKA and ERK via phosphorylation of the transcription factors CREB1 and CREB2. The extended model will include components of additional intra- and extracellular feedback loops (e.g., TGF?, and ApNT), an additional transcription factor (C/EBP), ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK) and p38 MAP kinase. In Aim 2, this model will be used to predict stimulus protocols, as well as pharmacological treatments, that enhance LTF and that rescue impaired LTF. Aim 3 will extend our current model of LTP, which describes roles of several kinase pathways (e.g., MAPK, PKA, PKC, and CAMKII) and histone acetylation. The model will incorporate a recently delineated BDNF positive-feedback loop, which leads to activation of ERK, phosphorylation of CREB1, and induction of transcription necessary for the consolidation of LTP. We will simulate stimulus protocols and drug effects to predict treatments that could rescue impaired memory mechanisms in Rett syndrome, which is caused by mutations that alter the activity of the transcription factor MeCP2, and that can rescue impaired mechanisms in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, which is caused by mutations in CREB binding protein. This proposed approach of using models to predict novel learning paradigms and/or drug treatments that restore normal plasticity, is an innovative methodology that could ultimately lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of cognitive disorders.',\n",
       " 'This application for funding is to support expenses for the 2018 22nd Annual Woods Hole Immunoparasitology Meeting (WHIP), which brings together principal investigators, students and postdoctoral fellows from around the world who are in the field of immunoparasitology. The 2018 meeting will be held on April 15-17, 2018. The annual gathering of scholars in this field was established in 1997 with the intent to provide a collegial meeting place for scientists to exchange ideas in this important field. The meeting averages 125 to 150 participants every year. While there are other meetings where senior principal investigators in this field present their data, the focus of this meeting is to provide a forum where graduate students and postdoctoral fellows present their work to each other and established investigators. The meeting also aims to provide the opportunity to highlight new junior faculty in the field. The location was chosen because of the strong association of the Marine Biology Laboratory (MBL) and the field of parasitology. This relationship began more than 30 years ago with the establishment of the annual summer course, ?Biology of Parasitism,? and with the annual Molecular Parasitology meeting held in the fall at the MBL. It is close to laboratories on the east coast, and accessible via direct flights to Boston from around the world. Over 85% of the talks at the WHIP meeting will be given by either graduate students or post-doctoral fellows, making this a unique meeting in the field. In addition to the oral presentations, all of the students and post-doctoral fellows have the opportunity to present their work in poster sessions. Thus, both in oral talks and poster sessions students and post-doctoral fellows in the field of immunoparasitology gain valuable experience in presenting their data, as well as contacts that will be useful for advancing their science and their careers.',\n",
       " 'IRON-DEPENDENCE OF CLOFAZIMINE ACTIVITY IN MYCOBACTERIA ABSTRACT Clofazimine (CFZ) is a riminophenazine dye that can be highly bactericidal against mycobacteria. Originally developed for use against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), it has been primarily used for the treatment of leprosy and is listed by the WHO as an Essential Medicine for adults and children. CFZ has recently been included in the WHO recommended five drug short-course for MDR-TB. However, the efficacy of CFZ for the treatment of Mtb infections in animal models and clinical trials has been mixed. Historically, CFZ demonstrated high activity against Mtb in vitro and in murine models; however, CFZ efficacy was low in other animal models. A recent report indicates that differences in CFZ activity are based on the microenvironment. In a standard BALB/c mouse model CFZ was highly active, whereas in the ?Kramnik? mouse model, CFZ failed to demonstrate activity against Mtb if administered after a point at which necrotic lesions had already formed. The primary difference between models in which CFZ is active and those in which it is not appears to be that necrotic granulomas exist in models in which CFZ is less active. CFZ is a redox-active molecule that interacts with the NADH reductase II of the electron transport system. Mutations that increase expression of MmpL5 confer moderate resistance to CFZ. MmpL5 belongs to the RND efflux family and is important in the export of the mycobacterial siderophores; membrane-bound mycobactin and the soluble form carboxymycobactin. Our data indicate that CFZ bactericidal activity is dependent on iron availability and the presence of the mycobactin iron acquisition system. We have also demonstrated that CFZ exposure induces iron acquisition genes and most importantly CFZ drains Mtb intracellular iron levels indicating CFZ acts via the depletion of intracellular iron. The goals of this project are to determine if CFZ kills through intracellular iron depletion and determine if CFZ efficacy can be improved in disease microenvironments, where iron is readily available, by inhibiting Mtb iron acquisition mechanisms. To achieve these goals we will determine the role of iron availability, acquisition mechanisms, and storage on CFZ killing and intracellular iron levels. We will also determine if chemical inhibition of Mtb iron acquisition will synergize with CFZ to allow lethal activity in necrotic lesions of the Kramnik mouse model.',\n",

       " 'Project Summary/Abstract  Dopamine D1 agonists have shown unique clinical potential for numerous disorders including cognitive deficits (e.g., from psychiatric or neurologic disorders or aging), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson?s disease, and cocaine abuse), and in the few reported clinical studies with experimental D1 agonists, the large effect sizes predicted from preclinical studies have been found. No brain available D1 agonist has yet been approved for clinical use largely because all high intrinsic activity D1 agonists were catechols, and had little oral bioavailability to justify clinical development. Pfizer Inc. has just reported non- catechol D1 agonists entering Phase III, and, although Phase II data are not public, their extensive studies in non-human primates (NHP) have confirmed the findings made with earlier, non-orally available compounds. This suggests that clinical use is on the horizon, raising numerous scientific questions, the most pressing of which is how the interactions of receptor occupancy and intrinsic activity translate into desired pharmacological effects. There are excellent D1 antagonist radioligands for in vivo imaging studies, but these ligands interact equivalently with active (high affinity G protein-coupled) and inactive (low affinity uncoupled) forms of the receptor. For this reason, they have been found to be insensitive to changes in dopamine signaling in vivo. We propose the discovery of a radiolabeled D1 selective agonist ligand that can be used in both laboratory and clinical imaging studies (e.g., SPECT) to quantify high affinity, functional receptors. We have selected a lead template based on excellent predicted pharmacodynamic properties and very accessible chemistry. We will make a precursor molecule that can be rapidly radioiodinated, and then deprotected to yield the candidate radioligand. We shall synthesize the intermediates and non-labeled predicted product, and validate the latter chemically and pharmacologically by its affinity and functional effects at dopamine receptors, and potential binding at off-target binding sites). Confirmation of its D1 agonist properties will be validated both behaviorally and physiologically, and we shall determine if it has metabolites that may affect its use. After the properties of the unlabeled probe have been confirmed, we shall develop and evaluate rapid and efficient radiosynthesis protocols for the candidate ligand. The proposed studies will use 125I, but are amendable to use of 123I (SPECT) or possibly PET (124I). We shall validate ligands by performing dose-response relationships, and compare the measured binding potential ex vivo with administered dose. We then shall select a tracer dose and perform competitive occupancy studies. Because we hypothesize that there are important in vivo differences between agonist and antagonist radioligands, we shall do parallel studies with the selective D1 antagonist [125I]- SCH28392, including autoradiography studies to compare the brain relative densities of high and low affinity sites. Finally, we shall validate the utility of the probe in vivo using functional assays for cognition and motor function.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vitamin C is an indispensable micronutrient for normal human health and well-being. Vitamin C deficiency leads to a variety of clinical abnormalities. The vitamin acts as a potent antioxidant and a cofactor for several enzymes, with low intracellular levels causing oxidative stress, a driver for many human diseases. Therefore, studies designed to optimize overall vitamin C body homeostasis are important. Humans have lost the ability to synthesis vitamin C endogenously, and must obtain it via intestinal absorption. The intestinal absorption process involves the human sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters-1 & 2 (hSVCT1& hSVCT2), where hSVCT1 is exclusively expressed at the apical membrane of the polarized enterocytes whereas hSVCT2 is localized basolaterally. The objectives of this proposal are to continue our investigations into the molecular physiology/cell biology of intestina vitamin C uptake process, and to address specific aspects of its pathophysiology as well as to determine the effect of external/internal factors on the uptake process. Our new preliminary studies suggest the involvement of microRNA and epigenetic mechanism(s) in the regulation of hSVCT1 expression, identified putative novel hSVCT1 interacting partners, and show a significant inhibition in vitamin C uptake upon exposure to specific enteric pathogens (EPEC and ETEC), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and to bacterial LPS. Based on these findings, our working hypotheses are: i) microRNA and epigenetic mechanism(s) regulate SVCT1 expression and function; ii) hSVCT1 has interacting partners that affect its physiology/cell biology; and iii) exposure to enteric pathogens, pro- inflammatory cytokines, and to bacterial LPS leads to a significant inhibition in intestinal vitamin C uptake. Three specific aims are proposed to test these hypotheses and will utilize state-of- the-art cell/molecular approaches. Results of these investigations should provide valuable information regarding the intestinal vitamin C absorption process under normal physiological conditions, and how this event is affected by specific pathophysiological factors. This should ultimately help us in designing effective strategies to optimize normal vitamin C body homeostasis, especially in conditions of deficiency/sub-optimal levels.',\n",
       " 'Abstract  Prevention of major depressive disorder (MDD) is a public health priority, and is in critical need of innovative strategies that preemptively identify those at-risk in order to enable early intervention. A recent meta-analysis of over 20 longitudinal studies found the risk for incident depression among individuals with insomnia disorder is nearly three times that for normal sleepers, thus making insomnia a potential point of entry for depression prevention.  Identification and treatment of insomnia typically occurs in primary care, and is commonly treated with hypnotic medications; however, hypnotics have significant limitations, including increased risk for residual impairment, falls in the elderly, and abuse. Cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBT-I) has been recommended as a first line approach with demonstrated efficacy that is sustained beyond initial therapeutic intervention. However, effective and widespread implementation of CBT-I is severely limited by the national shortage of trained practitioners in clinical practice. A stepped care approach rooted in primary care holds potential for innovative accessibility and delivery of CBT-I, improving insomnia therapeutics, and reducing rates of MDD by targeting a robust yet modifiable risk factor in insomnia. Our proposed stepped care model uses digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT-I) as an accessible, least-restrictive, first line intervention that reduces specialist time and resources, and adds clinician based face-to-face CBT-I only for refractory patients who need a more personalized, flexible, and durable therapist driven approach.  We propose a large-scale clinical trial in the primary care setting that utilizes a stepped care model (SMART design) to determine the effectiveness of dCBT-I alone and in combination with face-to-face CBT-I for insomnia, and the effects of these sleep interventions on the prevention of MDD. An important innovative component of the trial is the 1 and 2-year follow-up assessments to determine the durability of effectiveness over time and assess the impact on depression incidence and relapse. Early risk-detection and prevention is especially critical in those at elevated risk for depression to reduce health disparities. Thus, individuals with significant vulnerability to MDD, such as high sleep-reactivity, low socioeconomic status, and racial minorities will be included in significant numbers to test for potential moderation of treatment effects stratified by risk.  Finally, improving sleep through insomnia treatment may reduce nocturnal rumination, which may mitigate progression toward MDD. As such, we will determine whether changes in nocturnal rumination (i.e., target), a modifiable risk-factor, mediates the effects of CBT-I and dCBT-I on MDD incidence and relapse.  This project will test a highly scalable model of sleep care in a large primary care system to determine the potential for wide dissemination to address the high volume of population need for safe and effective insomnia treatment and associated prevention of depression.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To date, 2,937 genes underlying 4,163 Mendelian conditions (MCs) has been discovered. However, the genetic basis of over 3,000 MCs remains unknown, and hundreds of novel MCs are described each year. In 2011, the NHGRI and NHLBI established the Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG) to facilitate large-scale discovery of genes responsible for MCs. In Phase-1 of the CMG program, and in partnership with 182 investigators from 117 institutions in 27 countries, the University of Washington CMG (UW-CMG) assessed 6,598 samples from 2,404 families and has, to date, produced 4,116 exome and 97 whole genome sequences. This extensive collaborative effort resulted in an unparalleled pace of discovery with the identification of genes for 237 MCs, including 123 novel discoveries. The translation and impact of these discoveries on diagnostics and clinical care has been immediate and substantial-when combined with discoveries made by the genetics community at-large, variants in genes identified as underlying MCs since 2012 represent ~25% of positive results in clinical diagnostic efforts. Additionally, the UW-CMG has developed multiple new analytical tools including CADD, PRIMUS, SimRare, STAR, RV-TDT, CHP, VAT and Spliceosaurus as well as methodological innovations including MIPs, smMIPs and approaches for low input exome and genome sequencing. The UW-CMG remains deeply committed to open data sharing with rolling submission of eligible exome and genome data to dbGaP (614 deposited and 1,748 pending deposition) and development of a new data browser (http://geno2mp.gs.washington.edu) that, for the first time, publicly provides anonymized links between individual-level genotypes, from over 3,000 exomes, to individual clinical phenotypes, defined by Human Phenotype Ontology terms. In this renewal application, we build from these successes to maximize novel gene discovery for MCs, capitalizing on immediate access to >22,000 sequence-ready samples from >16,500 families and 163 MCs, access to several large cohorts of birth defects totaling more than 24,000 trios (>94,000 samples total) and an aggressive sample solicitation plan including case aggregation and case matching of undiagnosed patients who have undergone clinical exome sequencing. We propose four specific aims: (1) Solicit, organize, and curate phenotypic information and DNA samples from families with unexplained (i.e., no known underlying gene) MCs from sample custodians around the world, by submission to our center of either samples for sequencing or sequence data for further analysis; (2) Apply our established production pipeline for exome and genome sequencing to samples corresponding to unexplained MCs and to improve this process through ongoing technology innovation; (3) Determine the genetic basis of as many unexplained MCs as is possible, maximizing novel discovery, by use of efficient study design and effective, innovative analysis; (4) Take a leadership role to disseminate and openly share methods and data to promote worldwide efforts to discover the full complement of genes underlying MCs.',\n",

Data from the US Flu VE Network helps CDC to evaluate vaccine policy, WHO to select vaccine strains and clinicians to use antivirals.  We propose a test-negative case-control (TNCC) study to determine influenza VE in UPMC, which serves diverse populations in 500 clinical sites. UPMC wins awards as one of the most wired health systems in the U.S. UPMC preferentially uses high-dose vaccine for persons >65 years, routinely records vaccination status in its electronic medical record and has a two-way interface with the state immunization registry.  Our proposal has a strong foundation of current participation in the US Flu VE Network with a multidisciplinary research team with the highest follow-up survey completion rate and enrollment numbers exceeding requirements. Our award-winning, high-throughput lab proposes analyses of influenza, RSV and HMPV. Each virus season definition is supported by >14,000 clinical multiplex respiratory virus tests and ongoing syndromic surveillance. We add agent-based modeling at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The portfolio of research projects proposed as part of JIVE, Phase 5, will provide key information for a variety of stakeholders, including ACIP members, CDC decision makers, patients, providers, and payers, by utilizing a wide variety of economic and related methodological approaches in order to answer a series of research questions that address the Healthy People 2020 Objectives relating to vaccination and vaccination coverage. Working jointly with CDC co-investigators, the JIVE research team will conduct analyses to provide relevant economic data for high-priority vaccine policy decisions. This collaborative approach, in which the JIVE research investigators have extensive experience, represents an established process for providing policy-relevant economic information to the ACIP and other stakeholders. These studies will draw on the wide breadth of expertise available in the team of research investigators to create innovative research. The research team has extensive expertise in cost- effectiveness analysis, disease modeling, disease-specific expertise, survey methods expertise, and extensive experience surveying physicians. An infectious disease simulation model will be combined with a health-economic model to evaluate the effects of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination on diabetics. This will be the first economic evaluation to examine both of these vaccines in diabetics. Another study will evaluate the health-economics of a potential norovirus vaccine. This will be the first economic analysis to use a dynamic infectious disease simulation model to evaluate the value of a potential norovirus vaccine and capture indirect effects. Conjoint analysis methods will be applied to a novel application area, provider reimbursement, to identify barriers to vaccination stocking and recommendations. These and other related approaches represent the use of novel applications of economic and decision analysis methods to inform high-priority vaccine policy questions. Anticipated findings from proposed studies include:  ? Quantifying the value of vaccinating diabetic individuals for influenza and pneumococcal diseases ? Assessing of the value of preventing diabetes by evaluating the burden of vaccinating this high-risk group.  ? Preparing for an economic analysis of a potential norovirus vaccine.  ? Identifying the condition under which a potential norovirus vaccine would be cost-effective.  ? Determining what reimbursement procedures are the biggest barriers to physician stocking and recommending vaccines ? Examining how changing reimbursement policies might affect provider decisions to stock and recommend vaccines. These studies will provide relevant economic insights into high-priority vaccine policy decisions.',\n",
       " 'Influenza viruses are constantly evolving, resulting in vaccine strains being selected for reformulation every season. Annual estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing influenza-related morbidity are essential in evaluating the protection provided by annual, nationwide vaccination programs. Our long-term goal is to advance the understanding of the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections while measuring the public health impact of immunization on reducing the overall burden of illness and on improving the health of the population. We plan to systematically evaluate the influenza VE with the CDC ACIP recommended annual universal immunization strategy in the Baylor Scott & White Health, Central Texas (BSWCTX) patient population. The objective is to obtain reliable vaccination information for the enrolled population and provide accurate estimates of annual VE to prevent influenza-associated medically-attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) in the vaccine age-eligible population. Our central hypothesis is that timely and efficient measurement of annual VE and burden of illness due to seasonal/pandemic influenza, RSV and other respiratory viruses is sustainable. The rationale is that by assessing the mid-season VE, ACIP can recommend antiviral chemoprophylaxis and treatment for high risk groups, as needed. To accomplish the overall objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: 1) Assess influenza VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza among at least 1,000 children and adults, including at least 333 persons from each of three age groups (6 months ? 17 years, 18-49 years and ?50 years) with MAARI in ambulatory settings during each of 5 seasons from 2016-17, with at least 100 among young children aged 6 months ? 8 years and with at least 100 among adults aged ?65 years. 2) Evaluate disease burden due to seasonal influenza (during each of 5 seasons from 2016-17), RSV and other respiratory viruses (during seasons 3-5) among children (ages 6 months ? 17 years), adults (ages 18-64 years) and older adults (ages ?65 years). 3) Develop influenza pandemic preparedness operational plan and pilot research methods (during seasons 3-5) to describe the epidemiology of the novel influenza virus infection, beginning whenever the next influenza pandemic is imminent anywhere in the world, estimate MAARI incidence of pandemic influenza, estimate VE of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for prevention of pandemic influenza-associated MAARI, and evaluate the use and effectiveness of antiviral agents for treatment of pandemic influenza. To accomplish these goals, we will estimate real-time VE for the enrolled population in the ambulatory setting using a test-negative design, estimate burden of illness of seasonal/pandemic influenza, RSV and other respiratory viruses in the BSWCTX source population, and examine factors associated with VE. The proposed research is innovative in that it will generate new knowledge in the methods used to aptly measure influenza VE in different healthcare settings and measure burden of illness of influenza, RSV and other respiratory viruses in the West South Central region of the U.S.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) has the opportunity to expand upon a recent pilot study conducted in conjunction with team members from University of Rochester and their subcontractors at Google[X] and Answer Informatics working with a social media monitoring software (SoMMS) entitled nEmesis. The software nEmesis identifies tweets suggestive of foodborne illness by following a user for up to two weeks after the user posts from a food establishment. The nEmesis software then assigns a score to the food establishment based on the quantity and severity of sick tweets. In the pilot program, researchers are observing whether restaurants with high scores also tended to have worse health inspection outcomes as compared to blind assigned controls.  In the proposed research, SNHD plans to expand the software by incorporating existing foodborne illness data, including foodborne illness complaints and customer's sanitation complaints, into the software and allowing it to influence the score. The score will then be used as a tool to determine when and where a regulatory response is needed such as a routine inspection, or an epidemiological investigation, depending on the severity.  By using this novel technology, SNHD will potentially be able to identify cases of unreported foodborne illness faster and investigate cases and potential outbreaks quickly resulting in the reduced spread of disease in the community. Furthermore, if the intervention of unifying the nEmesis software with other foodborne illness predictors is able to identify foodborne illness outbreaks more quickly, less valuable time will need to be spent in the field investigating foodborne illness concerns.  In the proposed research study, SNHD will evaluate whether the intervention has an effect on foodborne illness in the community by monitoring rates of lab?confirmed salmonellosis and E. coli O157:H7, quantity of foodborne illness reports, and quantity of customer complaints on restaurant sanitation. Secondly, SNHD will evaluate whether the intervention has an effect on time spent investigating verified foodborne illness complaints and verified customer sanitation complaints. This data will be collected over the life of the research and then compared to baseline data and analyzed for differences.\",\n",
       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     BACKGROUND: In primary care, where the majority of prescribing occurs, only 4% to 21% of patients achieve the optimum benefit from their medications. As experts in drug therapy, clinical pharmacists are well-positioned to improve the quality of medication use in VHA primary care. Under the Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) model, however, a single pharmacist is assigned to more than 5,000 patients and cannot possibly review each patient's medication regimen at each visit. Thus, the effort of PACT pharmacists must be targeted to patients for whom the likelihood of benefit is greatest. THE TRIAGE ALGORITHM FOR PACT PHARMACY SERVICES (TAPPS): TAPPS is a novel health informatics tool that we developed to provide PACT pharmacists with concise real-time clinical reports to facilitate decisions about which patients are most likely to benefit from their services. Our approach is consistent with key PACT principles, where pharmacists contribute to team-based care by directly taking responsibility for patient outcomes, practicing at the top of their license, enhancing access, and leveraging health information technology to increase efficiency. TAPPS may be particularly beneficial for rural veterans, as patients engaged in primary care at rural VHA clinics are nearly 50% less likely to receive clinical pharmacy services than patients in primary care at a VHA medical center. RESEARCH PLAN: Aim 1 will test the utility of TAPPS by independently evaluating its 3 key innovations in 3 separate projects involving real-world primary care patients. Aim 2 will determine TAPPS effectiveness using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design. The study will involve 25 PACT pharmacists across 5 medical centers. All pharmacists will begin in the control condition (no access to TAPPS clinical reports) and randomly selected groups of pharmacists will be switched over to the intervention condition (full access to TAPPS reports) in successive 10-week time blocks, such that all pharmacists will be in the intervention condition by the end of the study. Aim 3 will gather qualitative interviews from PACT pharmacists involved in the stepped wedge trial after they have completed their first 10-week block of TAPPS use, with a repeated interview after their third 10-week block. The goal of these interviews is to assess both positive and negative effects of TAPPS on patient care and identify potential barriers to implementation. If TAPPS is proven effective, our findings will be used to make refinements to the TAPPS system and to design a subsequent national implementation study. IMPLICATIONS: TAPPS has the potential for significant impact on the health of veterans by enabling PACT pharmacists to minimize risk for adverse drug events and seek the full benefit of prescription medications. If proven effective, national implementation of TAPPS could affect all VHA primary care patients, with particular benefits for rural veterans. Our experience with TAPPS also has important implications outside VHA, including how medication therapy management services are delivered to Medicare Part D beneficiaries.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The VA has invested hugely in electronic medical records and has achieved a nationwide system that collects medical information from all patients. Currently, the textual information in the medical records is inaccessible to all but a small number of researchers. In order to obtain the highest value from this existing system, administrators and practitioners need to be able to access the textual information they need. It is our responsibility to get the most benefit from thi resource for biomedical and patient care. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is an important part the solution.  The value of NLP has been recognized in the biomedical domain. Evidence of this includes funding for the following national initiatives focused on clinical NLP: Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Consortium for Health Informatics Research (CHIR), VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP), and electronic Medical Records & Genomics (eMERGE). On the one hand, these efforts testify to the demand for NLP research. They have produced new NLP tools, created annotated datasets, developed common data models, shared semantic labels, and even piloted a prototype software ecosystem. On the other hand, the general consensus in the informatics community is that processing and utilizing textual data remains challenging due to lack of interoperability and collaboration. Unless the pace of research and development is accelerated in clinical NLP, we cannot meet the increasing NLP demand originated from the biomedical and health services research community.  Although synergistic development has the promise of advancing the science of NLP and accelerating the pace of NLP tool production, there lacks a vibrant collaborative environment attracting participation of a significant number of clinical NLP developers and researchers. Within the VA CHIR and VINCI efforts, we have created a prototype NLP ecosystem called V3NLP that supports the interoperability and integration of heterogeneous tools into VA research and operational initiatives. The environment needed to foster collaboration and a critical mass of users, however, is lacking. In the proposed project, we will study the needs of existing and potential users of the V3NLP ecosystem to increase its utility and ease of adoption and to facilitate collaboration.  The ultimate goal of an NLP ecosystem is to produce new and more accurate NLP methods for clinical text.  This requires a good understanding of the characteristics of various types of clinical text and the strengths and weakness of existing methods. Because most clinical NLP solutions have been driven by individual use cases and note collections, the resultant solutions are optimized for the characteristics of the specific NLP tasks and text corpora analyzed. Since there are numerous tasks and corpora, clinical NLP solutions tend to be difficult to re-use, especially by different developers. To remedy this, we will research characteristics of a very large and heterogeneous collection of VA text records to understand and model sublanguages in VA clinical notes. This systematic and comprehensive sublanguage analysis will play a critical role in the proposed ecosystem. It will guide the development of new clinical NLP methods as well as the customization of existing solutions.  Our general goal is to accelerate clinical NLP research and development. The specific aims are as follows:  (1) Collect and analyze the needs of NLP developers, health informatics researchers and health services researchers to inform the design of a collaborative NLP ecosystem that will facilitate development of more accurate methods.  (2) Design and implement a clinical NLP ecosystem that fosters collaboration and accelerates research and adoption of accurate and generalizable NLP methods.  (3) Conduct a comprehensive sublanguage analysis to guide the creation of adaptable NLP tools and methods based on VA text notes to support text processing and information extraction across multiple clinical domains.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare: Decision support, surveillance, and quality care initiatives have incredible potential to increase the health of veterans. The rich clinical data contained in the electronic health record enables development of these applications; however, much of that data is locked in free-text reports and remains inaccessible to computerized applications. Natural language processing (NLP) can be applied to provide structured output from free-text input. The VA has been at the forefront of developing NLP techniques within the VHA.  Background: A new generation of tools is needed to realize the vision of effective use and analysis of free-text clinical records for both improving care quality and informing clinical research. Clinical natural language  processing tools have been developed for classifying, extracting, and summarizing information from narrative  clinical texts, in support of diverse tasks  including the identification of patients with nosocomial infections,  phenotype-genotype correlation, and selection of patient cohorts for research studies. The VA has been a leader in developing NLP capability, with the hope of implementing NLP in system-facing, patient-facing, and team-facing applications being developed in hi2 HMP and iEHR. Many NLP tools and components are already being developed and hosted on Veteran's Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) (Project 1).  Unfortunately, a large gap between development and clinical/research practice limits applicability-most  applications require customization of NLP tools to specific domains, NLP tasks often require the combination of  multiple (often incompatible) tools, and there is a need to integrate external displays to aid interpretation.  Advances in human-computer interaction and information visualization suggest approaches that can help overcome many of these limitations. A growing body of experience with interactive visualizations of clinical data provides multiple models of how abstracted information from clinical records might best be displayed to users, while extensive experience in fields such as end-user programming and user-centered design provides guidance on how some of the shortcomings in clinical NLP application might be addressed.  Objective: We envision a flexible, user-centered development environment that will provide VA clinicians and medical researchers with the ability to customize and configure NLP and visualization components with little or no NLP-specific expertise or custom software development. As shown in Figure 1, we will build upon a solid  foundation of successful VA NLP components (Project 1) developed largely by members of this CREATE team  to realize this goal, applying user-centered design and evaluation techniques to address the gap between  existing NLP technology and the needs of end users (providers and researchers in projects 3 and 4). The resulting development environment will allow non-NLP experts to customize, investigate, and apply NLP to clinical tasks and to develop visual interfaces that integrate and display EHR data.  Methods: Consistent with the entire INFORMED CREATE, our approach is a user-centered approach in which the data needs of users are considered in the context of their clinical workflow. Users for this project are researchers and providers in Projects 3 and 4 seeking to develop applications for extracting, analyzing, and displaying structured and unstructured data from the EHR. The development environment will be a general-purpose toolkit for researchers developing diverse types of displays for many different domains.\",\n",
       " 'Anticipated Impact on Veterans Health Care: Nearly 25% of VA users are diagnosed with diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, end stage renal disease, amputations and a significant cause of hospitalizations for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Mortality rates among veterans with diabetes are twice as high compared to veterans without diabetes. In 2012, diabetes was estimated to cost $176 billion in direct medical and indirect costs. These health and cost implications make the effective management of diabetes a policy priority for healthcare providers and policymakers nationwide. This proposal will move beyond hemoglobin A1c (A1c) control to prevent diabetes complications and assess the role of A1c variability. Project Background: A major focus of diabetes management is glucose control, since persistently elevated A1c levels predict adverse health outcomes including microvascular complications. But lowering A1c to moderately stringent targets (<7%) could increase risks of macrovascular disease or mortality. There are increasing data showing that glucose variability plays a significant role in predicting risk of complications. Longer term variability as reflected in A1c fluctuations over time has been linked to risk of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. We have shown that among Veterans with diabetes, increasing A1c variability over a 3 year period is independently associated with risk of MI, ambulatory care sensitive condition hospitalization, and mortality. We wish to further study this for its potential clinical application by developing and validating a novel clinical measure of A1c variability that is unique to each patient.  Project Objectives: We propose an observational study to (a) construct statistical measures and determine  predictors of A1c variability, (b) develop and validate more intuitive clinical measures of A1c variability (i.e. %  time-in-range), and (c) assess the relationship between these measures of A1c variability and adverse health  outcomes in patients with diabetes. Specific objectives include: Objective 1. Construct statistical measures and determine the predictors of A1c variability. Objective 2. Develop and validate a more intuitive clinical measure of A1c variability defined as A1c time-in- range. We will calculate the percentage of days an individual has an A1c level in the appropriate range, based on clinical parameters and the VA-DoD clinical practice guidelines. Objective 3. Estimate the relationship between A1c variability, % time-in-range, and adverse health outcomes? including micro- and macrovascular complications and mortality. Project Methods: The proposed project is a retrospective observational study of secondary data from patient- level administrative and claims data from VA and Medicare. Utilization and pharmacy files will be used to determine patients diagnosed with diabetes between 2004 and 2015. A three-year baseline period will be used to calculate the individual A1c variability measure of coefficient of variation and a %time in range measure. The %time in range measure will be the percentage of days an individual has an A1c level in the appropriate range based on VA-DoD clinical practice guidelines. Patients will be assigned to the provider that orders the most A1c tests for them during the baseline period and provider A1c variability measures will be calculated. Provider A1c variability will be used as an instrumental variable to predict individual A1c variability, controlling for process quality (Objective 1, 2). Residuals will be captured from the equations estimated in these two objectives for Objective 3 to measure the effect of individual A1c variability on health outcomes. Significant relationships will then be further validated in a VA-Medicaid population.',\n",
       " 'Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant international public health threat, particularly for US military personnel who are often deployed to areas of high TB prevalence. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a respiratory pathogen spread via inhalation of infectious airborne particles. Most infected individuals develop protective immunity that serves to contain the organism, but approximately 10% will eventually develop active TB. The localization of mycobacteria-specific CD4+ T cells to the lung appears to be critical to protection against Mtb infection, and may not be optimized by current TB vaccination with intradermal (ID) M. bovis BCG. Human studies using lung cells obtainable by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) provide a means to assess local immune responses to Mtb that may be uniquely relevant to evaluating novel TB vaccines. The distinct nature of local immunity within the lung has been further emphasized by recent murine studies demonstrating that respiratory infection is followed by the development of CD4+ memory T cells that are localized to the lung parenchyma and do not rejoin the general circulation. These tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) display a distinct phenotype, and also show increased capacity to protect against respiratory infection with Mtb. The use of intravenous (IV) injection of pan-leukocyte antibodies to identify T cells that are not in communication with the vasculature has provided a means to sort pulmonary TRM from vascular-associated memory cells. This intriguing approach has not yet been applied to clarifying the significance of BAL-based studies of immunity to Mtb; this step is critical, however, to the ultimate application of these insights to human studies. The overall goal of the current proposal is to clarify the mechanisms by which CD4+ T cells within BAL differ from and interact with other lung CD4+ T-cell populations to mediate lymphocyte recruitment to the lung and, ultimately, protection against respiratory challenge with Mtb. Our research team is uniquely qualified to address these issues, as it includes investigators with experience in bronchoscopy-based studies of human immunity to Mtb (Richard Silver, PI), murine assessments of immunity to Mtb (W. Henry Boom, Consultant) and optimization of immune assays involving lung cells from both mice and humans (Tracey Bonfield, Co-investigator). We will also greatly benefit from the involvement of a pioneer in the application of TRM methodology to the study of Mtb infection (Daniel Barber of NIAID, Consultant). Our studies will utilize a murine model of Mtb infection in which lung homogenate cells stained by IV injection (?IV+ T cells?) associated with the lung vasculature are sorted from T cells that cannot be labeled in this manner. These ?IV- T cells? predominantly display a TRM phenotype and are retained within the parenchyma. We will apply this approach to evaluate the interactions of IV- and IV+ lung CD4+ T cells and to clarify their relationship to BAL CD4+ T cells in mice. Parallel human studies will utilize both baseline BAL cells and unique samples obtained by modeling recall responses to Mtb protein antigens using bronchoscopic segmental antigen challenge with purified protein derivative of Mtb (PPD). These approaches will be integrated to address the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine the mechanisms by which mycobacteria-specific CD4+ T cells in BAL are phenotypically distinct from IV- and IV+ lung homogenate CD4+ T-cell populations; 2) To determine the mechanisms by which BAL CD4+ T-cells interact with IV- and IV+ CD4+ lung T-cell populations to recruit additional T cells to the lung parenchyma and airways; 3) To determine the mechanisms by which BAL and lung parenchymal CD4+ T cells interact to mediate protection against respiratory infection with virulent M. tuberculosis.',\n",
       " 'Veteran suicides, attempts and suicidal ideation (SI) remain of urgent concern to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Recent reports indicate that approximately half of veteran suicides take place within 1 month of the decedent?s final VHA encounter, with one quarter occurring within 1 week. This provides a temporal window of opportunity to intervene, and necessitates development of a rapid-acting treatment for veterans with SI. Intravenous ketamine is the prototypical anti-suicidal drug, that rapidly reduces SI in some patients. However, there are concerns regarding ketamine?s toxicity in both veterans, and military personnel. These include ketamine?s potential for toxicity and misuse, and the brief duration of anti-suicidal effect. The ideal VHA anti-suicidal treatment: 1) Could be administered orally rather than intravenously; 2) Would achieve ?target engagement? with the same neural substrates as ketamine; 3) Would have fewer risks; and 4) Would have a longer duration of action and/or a more durable antisuicidal effect. Therefore this study will test the novel intervention uridine as a rapid-acting oral treatment for veterans with SI. As described in the proposal, uridine?s potential to fill this role lies in the broad overlap in the brain mechanisms and neural effects shared by uridine, ketamine and the anti-suicidal drug lithium. The reason for this surprising commonality may lie in the fact that ketamine?s mechanism-of-action dependent on activation of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis ? and the fact that uridine is the endogenous circulating pyrimidine in man. To initiate testing of uridine for veterans with SI, we will conduct a four-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of uridine 2000 mg daily for veterans with SI. To make the study more informative, translational neuroimaging is integrated into the protocol to identify biomarkers of SI. Veterans will undergo proton-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) imaging at baseline, with scans repeated after 1 week of treatment, in pursuit of a neurochemical biosignature of rapid SI reduction. Upon completion of the four-week placebo-controlled phase, participants will enter the six-month open-label phase of the study. The open-label phase will accomplish two goals: 1) To evaluate the durability of uridine?s anti-suicidal effect in uridine responders; and 2) To ensure that veterans initially randomized to placebo have a full and fair opportunity to benefit from active treatment. In summary, while piloting a much-needed alternative to intravenous ketamine for suicidal veterans, this research also aims to participate in establishing the neurochemical biomarkers of suicidal ideation, and treatment response.',\n",

       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the course of accomplishing the previous specific aims, we found that a relatively brief expression of a mitochondrial targeted restriction endonuclease, ubiquitously in mice, generates double strand breaks (DSB) in the mtDNA of the different tissues. MtDNA levels recovered from this transient event and no abnormal phenotypes were observed in the weeks following the molecular insult. However, later in life mice developed a phenotype resembling accelerated aging. Initial characterization showed a reduction in progenitor cell pools. These observations, together with other recent reports led us to hypothesize that progenitor cells are targets of mtDNA damage. We also obtained preliminary data showing that p53-associated pathways are involved in the mechanism leading to a reduction of progenitor cell pools after mtDNA transient insults. We propose a series of experiments to rigorously test this hypothesis in mouse and cultured cells. We will also develop a valuable model of mice with heteroplasmic mtDNA deletions, which will be used to unveil the role of mtDNA deletions in aging. These models will be shared with the research community. We expect that these studies will increase our understanding the role of mtDNA damage in aging.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High quality, real-time data is essential in public health crises. Yet, traditional survey methods that rely on random-digit-dialing are expensive, difficult to deploy instantly, and fail to sample hard-to-reach populations without landline telephones, such as young adults (18-30) and minorities. In contrast, these groups heavily use social media. Twitter, in particular, is widely available and immediate, providing a rich data source that can be used to pilot hypotheses at minimal cost. These hypotheses can then be modified prior to a more in-depth study. Social media data pose challenges for public health officials and researchers who aim to test new hypotheses and policies. These challenges are related to the size of the dataset and the difficulty filtering and validating these data. We will therefore develop and test an innovative computational tool that overcomes these challenges. This tool will supplement traditional survey techniques by facilitating real-time data gathering and rigorous quantitative analysis of social media data related to health narratives, attitudes, and behaviors. We will validate our tool by comparing existing survey data to social media data about influenza vaccination among adults 18-30, adult African Americans, and non-White Hispanics of all ages - three demographic categories with the highest rates of social media use, lower rates of participation in survey research, and lowest rates of seasonal flu vaccination. Thus, our tool will enable theory building. We will test hypotheses derived from the health communication literature, especially regarding how group attitudes form and change, categorize attitudes and collective narratives by existing theories and conceptual models, and build new theory to capture emerging and previously unidentified concepts. Finally, we disseminate our results and novel techniques using a website, vaccinetrends.org, that provides processed social media data to the research community. Our approach offers inexpensive, immediate access to the attitudes of these groups, transcending traditional constraints of time, money, and data access. Our approach is novel because it combines the strengths of social media analysis with those of validated survey techniques. We will draw upon two complementary population samples, representing different timescales and demographics, in order to test hypotheses in a manner that is rapid yet rigorous. In addition, our social media analysis will draw upon novel techniques to infer demographic information and social group membership, enabling the extraction of master narratives - attitudes and content that are associated with rationales for vaccine refusal and, ultimately, behavior. In addition, we will develop tools and techniques that can be adopted by researchers throughout the social, computer, and health sciences. Finally, we draw upon a much more extensive data source than has been found in previous work, including billions of Twitter messages and public forum information that will enable in-depth automated content analysis of vaccine refusal rationales.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The kidney contains a multitude of functional units called nephrons that are built during fetal development from a mesenchymal progenitor population. Although stem-like in many aspects, these progenitors differentiate en masse before or shortly after birth. Variability in the timing of this event determines nephron endowment, with low nephron number being correlated with serious health consequences including hypertension, glomerulosclerosis, and chronic kidney disease in adulthood. The mechanisms that lead to the depletion of CM cells remain elusive. Because the progenitors contribute to their own niche we hypothesized that cell intrinsic changes within the CM dictate the collective exit from the niche. To test this hypothesis, we established a new transplantation assay of nephron progenitors to evaluate engraftment of old and young progenitors into the same young niche. We discovered proliferation rates, exit rates, adhesion properties and prolonged niche residence a were inversely correlated with age. Importantly, a few old progenitors remain in the niche for up to 7 days post engraftment, a net gain of 50% to their lifespan, but only if completely surrounded by young neighbors. We will test three hypotheses: (1) changes in Fgf20 (reduced with age) and/or mTor signaling (increased with age) are driving exit from the niche. (2) We will also test the hypothesis that age-dependent epigenetic changes lower the bar for mesenchymal to epithelial transition. (3) We posits that progressive changes in the transcriptome and translatome drive niche exit. We performed unbiased transcriptome profiling of single nephron progenitors and identified distinct age-dependent transcriptional signatures, showing changes in the translation machinery. We propose to complete the analysis by examining the changes in the translatome. The engraftment assay will determine which manipulations of candidate genes delays niche exit. We will use animal models to test of this opens the door to increasing nephron endowment in situ.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midnight is no longer mid-night for individuals in the developed world. Many adolescents and young adults are awake and active at midnight. Artificial lighting, caffeine, and alarms have enabled this dissociation of sleep/wake+light/dark schedules from the external environment. In addition, many individuals have different schedules on work/school and non-work/non-school days, with later bedtimes, later wake times, and more frequent naps on non-work/non-school days. We and others have found correlations between irregular sleep/wake schedules and later circadian timing, poorer mood, poorer academic performance, and some health metrics, such as weight and psychiatric disorders. These, however, are correlations and not causal links. Identifying mechanisms by which modifiable behaviors, such as variable sleep timing, impact physiology is vital to developing effective educational or treatment-based strategies. We propose an experiment to test the effects of irregular and regular sleep/wake schedules on circadian timing, sleep, cognitive performance, mood, and learning. We will study a young adult population, as this is a time in human development when variable sleep schedules are prevalent and the consequences of irregular schedules on circadian timing, sleep propensity, performance, mood, and learning may be pronounced. The results from the proposed work will allow us to determine if it is the irregularity of the sleep/wake light/dark (SW/LD) schedule that delays circadian timing and disrupts performance, mood, and learning. Using our Sleep Regularity Index (SRI, a quantitative measure of sleep regularity), we will identify and select individuals with Irregular and Regular sleep/wake schedules based on the individual's sleep-wake pattern during three weeks of outpatient screening at home. Individuals from each group will then be randomly assigned to either an Irregular or Regular SW/LD schedule for an inpatient assessment. Assessments of circadian phase, sleep propensity, cognitive performance including vigilant attention, sleep-dependent and long-term learning, and mood will be conducted during the inpatient portion of the study. Our findings will help define physiological links among multiple physiological systems, including sleep/wake, light-sensitive processes (e.g., circadian rhythms, alertness, hormones), cognitive performance, and mood. Reducing scheduled sleep variability has no pharmacologic side-effects and may have additional health benefits. Designing effective therapeutic strategies for reducing variability requires an understanding of the physiological and environmental factors that may mediate and reinforce irregularity. Our results will help to elucidate these mechanisms and will be applicable to high school and college students, as well as adults working shift or night work or experiencing jet-lag. The findings may be utilized in public health forums, including educational campaigns about sleep timing and its effects on circadian rhythms, performance, learning, mood, and safety.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Each of the Project Leaders supported by the proposed Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) will require the generation of new genetically modified mice or cell lines to accomplish the goals of their proposed studies. To serve the needs of this COBRE, a Genetic Models Core will be created by expanding an existing transgenic mouse facility at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). This existing facility has a strong record of producing transgenic mice. However, to meet the needs of the proposed CMDR, it will be necessary to expand its capabilities by adding new technologies and personnel. This will be accomplished in part using recently developed tools that are based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system to provide gene-editing services in both mice and cell lines. This expansion of services will create a Genetic Models Core that, in addition to meeting the needs of the COBRE Project Leaders, will provide new cutting-edge services to the research communities at UAMS, its affiliated institutions, and across Arkansas. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to provide state-of-the-art services for the generation and maintenance of genetically modified mice. Generation services will include the design and creation of transgenic and gene-targeted mice by pronuclear injection. Maintenance services will include sperm cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization, and strain rederivation. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to develop new approaches and services that support genetic model creation and use. New services needed by CMDR members, such as creation of genetically modified cell lines, will be developed. In addition, Core personnel will continuously update gene-editing tools for cell and mouse modification via evaluation of current literature and attendance at workshops and meetings. In Specific Aim 3, we propose to provide training and education related to the use of genetic models. Project Leaders and other users will be trained to efficiently and accurately produce experimental cohorts of genetically modified mice, and we will educate users on potential problems that are often encountered with the use of such models. Core personnel will also educate the research communities at UAMS and other campuses in Arkansas, about the services and technologies available through the Genetic Models Core. The scientific theme of the proposed CMDR is that conditions that lead to deterioration of the skeleton have a molecular basis whose identification will guide development of specific and effective therapies. The Genetic Models Core is consistent with this theme in that it will allow Project Leaders to rapidly and efficiently test the role of specific molecular changes in pathological processes the affect the skeleton or in which the skeleton plays a major role, such as myeloma or breast cancer metastases.',\n",
       " 'Altered lipid homeostasis and increased whole body fat are hallmarks of obesity which has become a national epidemic. In turn, mammalian intestinal absorption of lipids is dependent on bile acids. Bile acids themselves are reabsorbed in the distal ileum via the intestinal apical sodium-dependent bile acid co-transporter (ASBT, SC10A2) localized at the brush border membrane (BBM) of absorptive villus cells. ASBT is the sole bile acid absorptive mechanism in the human intestine. While increased lipid absorption is known in obesity, how ASBT mediated intestinal bile acid absorption may be regulate in obesity is not known. Preliminary studies in well- established in-vivo models of obesity, specifically in Obese Zucker rats and TALLYHO mice, suggest that ASBT is increased in villus cells. This is not secondary to altered Na-extruding capacity of the cell as Na-K- ATPase levels were not increased but decreased in these cells. Similar observations were seen in obese humans. Given these translationally relevant novel observations, the overall hypothesis of this proposal is that enhanced lipid absorption of obesity mediated by bile acids is facilitated by stimulation of ASBT during obesity. Therefore, the overall aim of this proposal is to determine the molecular and intracellular mechanisms of regulation of ASBT in obesity. Three specific aims will complementarily and comprehensively address this novel hypothesis: Aim 1. Determine the broad applicability of stimulation of ASBT in villus cells during obesity Aim 2. Delineate the specific transcriptional mechanism of stimulation of ASBT in villus cells. Aim 3. Determine the specific post-transcriptional mechanism of stimulation of ASBT in villus cells. The results of these studies will provide new and important knowledge of the regulation of the ASBT in obesity which may allow for the design of ASBT inhibitors that would reduce lipid absorption and decrease obesity. The novel observations of this proposal about the regulation of ASBT during obesity will provide the basis for a future R01 application, which will focus on the intracellular mechanism of regulation of ASBT stimulation as well as the alterations in ASBT in human obesity. Ultimately, better understanding of ASBT regulation in obesity will result in better treatment modalities for the obesity epidemic in this country.',\n",
       " 'Childhood obesity can be devastating to the growing skeleton because it can accelerate bone elongation and contribute to the development of painful conditions such as limb bowing, joint instability, fractures, and slipped epiphyses. The primary obstacle to successful clinical intervention is lack of knowledge of the underlying cause of obesity-induced growth acceleration. Paradoxically, obese children have low to normal levels of growth hormone and IGF-I, the two major hormones that stimulate growth. IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), which restrict growth by sequestering free IGF-I, are reduced in obesity. Preliminary data suggest that local binding proteins may regulate bone elongation by entrapping IGF-I and limiting its transport into the skeleton. The long- term goal is to elucidate the role of local IGFBPs in regulating bone elongation in skeletal growth plates. The overall objective is to determine how IGFBP reduction leads to growth acceleration in obesity. The central hypothesis, based on strong preliminary data and tested under two specific aims using dynamic in vivo multiphoton microscopy and a mouse model of human obesity, is that a decrease in local IGFBPs promotes bone lengthening by allowing more IGF-I transport into growth plates. Specific Aim 1 uses in vivo cartilage imaging and ex vivo protein assays to determine bone elongation rate, IGFBP levels, and amount of IGF-I transport into growth plates of obese and non-obese mice. Specific Aim 2 uses local injections to deliver IGFBPs into one limb of young mice to show if local IGFBPs limit IGF-I transport and elongation rate. The rationale for demonstrating a causative link between local IGFBPs in the skeleton and IGF-I transport into growth plates is to facilitate design of IGFBP-based therapies to regulate skeletal growth and improve bone quality in obese children. This project is innovative by using multiphoton imaging to dynamically assess growth plate transport at the cellular level in vivo. This contribution is significant because it can yield transformative findings that mechanistically link IGFBPs to IGF-I uptake in cartilage and bone elongation rate. Such results could aid the development of IGFBPs as a therapeutic strategy for normalizing bone maturation rate in obese children, thus reducing chronic adult disability.',\n",

These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.',\n",

       " \"Project Summary/Abstract In order to meet the complex health care needs of the diverse U.S. population, medical schools must strive to 1) instill in students the values and skills that maximize empathic, patient-centered care, 2) encourage more students to choose careers in primary care, and 3) inspire more students to practice medicine in areas and with populations that are underserved. Despite years of interventions designed to reach these goals, medical schools continue to see declines in students' prosocial attitudes and values during medical school. These attitudes predict the provision of patient-centered care, itself a strong determinant of better patient adherence, utilization, and health outcomes. Furthermore, the U.S. faces a projected shortage of 20,400 primary care physicians by the year 2020, and has an immediate need for 8,200 additional primary care physicians in Healthcare Provider Shortage Areas (HPSAs). These problems each contribute to persistent racial and socioeconomic status disparities in health care access, quality, and outcomes. This study will consist of a secondary data analysis of the CHANGES study (Cognitive Habits and Growth Evaluation), a nationally-representative longitudinal study of medical students' experiences during medical school. We will use these data to develop comprehensive models of change in prosocial attitudes and intentions between matriculation and graduation. Specifically, our aims are to 1) assess the independent impact of medical school climate, curriculum, contact, and student experiences on change in a) empathy, b) attitudes about the importance of empathy, and c) attitudes about the importance of patient-centeredness; 2) assess the independent impact of medical school climate, curriculum, contact, and student experiences on intention to specialize in a primary care field of medicine; and 3) assess the independent impact of medical school climate, curriculum, contact, and student experiences on intention to practice medicine in an HPSA or with underserved populations.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  One billion people will die from tobacco-related illnesses this century. Most health care providers, however, fail to treat tobacco dependence. This may in part be due to the treatment default. Current treatment guidelines recommend that providers a) ask patients if they are willing to quit and b) provide cessation-focused medications and counseling only to smokers who state they are willing to quit. For other health conditions-diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and even substance abuse-the treatment default is to a) identify the health condition and b) initiate evidence-based treatment. For example, when a patient is newly diagnosed with hypertension, they aren't asked if they are `ready' to start treatment. The physician simply begins with a prescription or discussion of treatment options. As with any healthcare treatment option, patients are free to decline-they can opt out if they wish to refuse care. If patients do nothing, they will receive care. For tobacco users, however, the default is that they have to opt in to receive cessation assistance: providers ask smokers if they are willing to quit, and only offer medications and cessation support to those who say yes. This drastically limits the reach of cessation services because, at any given encounter, only 1 in 3 smokers say they are ready to quit. As a result, few receive medications or cessation counseling. Recent studies suggest that, when provided with cessation medications and counseling, unmotivated smokers are as likely to quit as motivated smokers. Hence, there is a critical need to examine the impact of changing the treatment default on utilization and quitting. The objective of this application is to determine the impact of providing all smokers wit tobacco treatment unless they refuse it (OPT OUT) versus current practice-screening for readiness and only offering treatment to smokers who say they are ready to quit (OPT IN). The study employs an individually-randomized design, and is conducted in a tertiary care hospital. We will conduct the trial among 1,000 randomly-selected hospitalized smokers to determine the population impact of changing the treatment default, identify mediators of outcome, and determine the cost-effectiveness of this new, highly proactive approach. This is a population-based study that targets an endpoint of vital interest; applies minimal eligibility criteria to broaden generalizability; and utilizes hospital staff for interventions to ensure long-term sustainability. The study employs an innovative Baysian adaptive design to evaluate a major shift in our approach to care. If effective, this change would expand the reach of tobacco treatment from 30% to 100% of smokers.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract There is a significant unmet clinical need to find effective analgesic drugs for the treatment of chronic pain that have fewer adverse effects, tolerance development, and abuse potential. We have identified a novel mixed efficacy opioid ligand (AAH8) that is highly effective for treating pain in animal models but does not produce tolerance or dependence when administered repeatedly. This compound appears to have minimal rewarding effects in an animal model. These data suggest that our candidate compound may be the ultimate opioid analgesic that produces significant pain relief with little risk of developing tolerance or addiction. AAH8 has equivalent affinity for mu and delta opioid receptors but it is a mu opioid receptor agonist and a delta opioid receptor antagonist and appears to cross the blood brain barrier. Blocking delta-opioid receptors has been proposed to alter the trafficking of mu-opioid receptors as related to desensitization, downregulation, and tolerance. While it is unusual to think that an effective mu-opioid analgesic would not have abuse potential, our preliminary data suggest that the mixed efficacy opioid ligand marks a significant improvement over current opioid analgesics, especially for treating chronic pain. Therefore, the long-term goal of the proposed work is to identify effective treatments for chronic pain with fewer adverse consequences associated with long term treatments. The objective here is to examine the effects of AAH8 in models of chronic pain, drug self- administration, and adverse side effects as compared with clinically used opioid analgesics. The overarching hypothesis is that AAH8 will have limited reinforcing effects in a drug self-administration assays and will retain efficacy in chronic pain assays. To accomplish this work, AAH8 will be evaluated in a chronic pain models and in drug self-administration assays in opioid-naÃ¯ve and -experienced subjects to determine its reinforcing effects. Overall, this venture has the potential to identify a drug that would dramatically improve the treatment and management of chronic pain by reducing the hazards associated with long term opioid treatment.',\n",
       " 'Inhibiting the oncogene c-Myc and mutant KRas remains a major challenge in cancer research. c-Myc and KRas are hyperactive in more than 70% of all human cancers, and contribute to resistance to therapies. However, drugs that directly inhibit c-Myc or mutant KRas have not yet been developed. c- Myc and KRas are key oncogenic drivers in colorectal cancer, a leading cause of cancer death; nearly 100% of colorectal cancers depend on c-Myc, while KRas mutations occur in ~50% of colorectal cancers. Recent findings indicate that post-translational modification by the Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifiers (SUMO) play a critical role in c-Myc and KRas-dependent oncogenesis; however, the mechanisms of how SUMOylaton is involved in c-Myc and KRas-dependent oncogenesis are not well understood. Wnt-signaling pathways could be a critical link of SUMOylation to both c-Myc activation and KRas mutation in colorectal cancers. Dysregulated Wnt-signaling leads to increased c-Myc expression and activity. In addition, KRas mutation suppresses the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, thereby enhancing the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway. Wnt signaling is also key to maintaining the pool of cancer stem cells in a wide range of cancers. During the previous funding period, we found that inhibition of SUMOylation significantly suppressed Wnt down-stream targets, including c-Myc. Key proteins, both in the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways, have been recently shown to be substrates of SUMOylation. However, the current understanding of how SUMOylation regulates the Wnt pathways is incomplete, and thus will be investigated here using colorectal cancer as a model system. We will conduct a combination of structural studies and chemical synthesis to determine the mechanism of allosteric inhibition by our lead small molecule SUMOylation inhibitor. We will conduct biochemical and molecular biological studies to elucidate the mechanism of SUMOylation in the Wnt signaling pathways. Finally, we will determine the therapeutic efficacy of our lead SUMOylation small molecule inhibitor in c-Myc and KRas-dependent colorectal cancers. We expect that the proposed studies will lead to a new paradigm by providing proof of principle for much-needed therapies that target c-Myc and KRas and dysregulated Wnt-signaling. Our work will also have implications for the many other cancers that are dependent on c-Myc and KRas. !',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 26 million people in the U.S. have chronic kidney diseases, most commonly from diabetic glomerular injury. However, progression to end stage is more tightly coupled to proximal tubule disappearance (tubular atrophy), which is caused by apoptosis. In the previous funding period we determined that intracellular accumulation of a non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) metabolite, long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (LC-CoA), stimulates tubular atrophy by a mechanism that involves inhibition of NHE1 Na+/H+ exchanger-dependent cell survival. Excess LC-CoAs are stored as cytoplasmic lipid droplets to shield cells from lipotoxicity, though this NEFA buffering capacity is limited in the proximal tubule. Multiple factors converge to cause NEFA accumulation in diabetic nephropathy, but most notably reabsorption of filtered albumin bound to NEFA.  We hypothesize that luminal NEFA uptake by fatty acid transporter-2 (FATP2) causes proximal tubule lipoapoptosis, which contributes to tubular atrophy and progression of diabetic nephropathy. The hypothesis will be pursued with the following specific aims: (1) To determine whether FATP2 is the major transporter for luminal proximal tubule NEFA uptake, fluorescently labeled NEFA uptake will be measured in isolated perfused proximal tubules from FATP2-deficient mice, and apoptosis will be assayed in cultured proximal tubule cells treated with shRNAs directed against FATP2; (2) To determine the pathophysiological relevance of FATP2- mediated NEFA internalization in diabetic nephropathy 13C-labeled NEFA uptake will be assayed in vivo in eNOS-/-db/db mice prone to diabetic nephropathy, and the effects of insulin on FATP2-dependent NEFA uptake in proximal tubule cells will be measured; (3) Genetic and pharmacologic tools will be employed to test whether proximal tubule NEFA uptake regulates diabetic nephropathy progression in eNOS-/-db/db mice. Upon completion of these experiments we are hopeful that FATP2 will emerge as a druggable target for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.',\n",
       " 'Advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) have accelerated the discovery of the genetic basis of numerous human diseases and conditions, including congenital disorders. These conditions affect a wide range of physiological systems, including cardiovascular, craniofacial, nervous, genital/urinary, in addition to general defects growth and dysmorphology. However, the process of ascribing causality to a given variant can be challenging and remains a major bottleneck in our understanding of human disease. Animal model validation is a powerful tool to evaluate the causality of a given variant, and the mouse provides the ideal mammalian system to model developmental disorders. CRISPR/Cas9 technology has simplified and reduced the timelines for mouse model creation, but breeding time will still typically take up to a year or more before phenotypes can be examined. Thus, a validation platform that directly examines this founder population (F0 generation) promises to massively reduce the time and expense required for validation of new human disease mutations in the mouse. Our preliminary work provides proof-of-principle evidence that this approach is feasible, however challenges remain before such an approach can be applied to a wide range of human developmental conditions. Direct screening of F0 embryos provides a means to examine more difficult engineering and breeding challenges, include dominant mutations that are predicted to be lethal in the mouse, and modeling multigenic causes of disease. Moreover, a F0 platform can provide a tool for rapid, direct genetic interrogation of pathways through multiplex mutagenesis. Challenges remain, however, before this approach can be effectively implemented as a robust platform. For example, while generation indels and deletions through error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair is highly efficient, editing of specific mutations through homology directed repair (HDR) occurs at a much lower rate. Additionally, founders and F0 embryos are typically mosaic and the tools to quantitatively assess both the spectrum of alleles and the mutagenesis rate for each require further development. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to build upon our proof-of-principle studies to optimize our F0 screening platform and implement it to model structural birth defects. We will test our hypotheses that 1) modification of parameters of the CRISPR mutagenesis protocol can improve the efficiency and reduce the mosaicism of HDR; and 2) that we can apply the platform to specific unique congenital disease challenges not easily modeled with standard mouse genetics approaches. This will take advantage of several key resources, including a high-throughput embryonic phenotyping pipeline developed for the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) and the large-scale mouse production capabilities of The Jackson Laboratory. The long-term goal is to integrate our screening platform with large- scale precision modeling initiatives, providing a rapid and robust means to evaluate new genetic variants in a mammalian model system.

       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Brain tumor is the leading cause of solid tumor death in children and one of the top leading causes of cancer death in young male and female adults with ages of 20-39 . Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults with an overall incidence of 20% of all primary brain tumors. Despite current standard of care, which includes surgery and chemo-radiation, the median survival is only 14.6 months. Due to the highly invasive nature of GBM cells, standard treatment with gross total resection of the tumor is insufficient to achieve a cure because of the high rate of recurrence by tumor cells outside the tumor resection margins. Moreover, there is an unmet need in the ability of clinicians to identify patients with lower survival times and high risk of recurrence. Developing novel prognostic tools for determining patient survival and for identifying cell subpopulations that have a significantly increased motility and aggressiveness, and drive recurrence is of utmost importance. Intriguing data based on a retrospective study of our GBM patients reveal that: 1) our novel Microfluidic Invasion Network Device (MIND) predicts survival in GBM patients based on the increased percentage of invasive cells in the heterogeneous population; 2) we are able to separate the invasive from non-invasive cell using MIND device, which will allow us to understand the underlying molecular differences of the more aggressive subpopulations; 3) the targetable transcription factor TEAD4 is selectively overexpressed and hyperactive in GBM and promotes confined GBM migration. In light of these findings, we propose to: i) establish our MIND platform as an adjunct tool to the clinical management of GBM patients prospectively, ii) uncover novel drivers of GBM cell invasion, and iii) utilize it as a high-throughput assay for screening potential therapeutic drugs. To achieve these goals, we will pursue the following specific aims: to determine the prognostic power of confined space migration in a prospective cohort of GBM patients using MIND (Aim 1); to characterize the molecular drivers of confined space migration of phenotypically aggressive brain cancer cells using MIND (Aim 2); to evaluate the in vivo translational efficacy of 42 chemotherapeutic agents tested in MIND (Aim 3). In vitro experiments will be conducted using prospectively collected patient-derived primary GBM cell lines from over 100 patients. Our proprietary and novel MIND platform will be used to study confined- space migration from these patients to identify poor prognosis and high recurrence prospectively with the future goal of achieving personalized treatments for patients. In vivo studies will be conducted using our established orthotopic human brain tumor initiating cell-derived GBM model in mice. The results obtained from this study will to lead to the development of a platform for precision medicine with the ability to test drugs in a high throughput fashion using freshly isolated human tissue.',\n",
       " \"Abstract Survival in a hostile environment requires the ability to assess potential threats and take the most appropriate defensive action. Accumulating evidence suggests that the amygdala is well positioned to integrate information about threats and to guide or shift responses along a spectrum of potential defensive behaviors. In both humans and mice, the amygdala plays an essential role in defensive responses to the threat of suffocation, signaled by rising systemic carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the body. Lesioning the amygdala, or manipulating it more precisely in other ways, reduces some defensive behaviors evoked by CO2 inhalation (e.g. freezing) while simultaneously increasing others (e.g. fight-or-flight). Because CO2 inhalation evokes a variety of defensive responses in a robust, reproducible, and concentration-dependent manner, CO2 provides a straightforward and translatable approach to studying the amygdala's role in defensive behavior regulation. In this application, we propose to study defensive behaviors evoked by CO2 using state-of-the-art, neuron- specific manipulations and electrophysiological recording to deconstruct roles of select neuron populations in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). We hypothesize that distinct defensive behaviors are differentially regulated by the BLA and that principal neurons and interneurons in the BLA each play unique roles. To test this hypothesis we will use genetic, optogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches to specifically activate and silence specific BLA neuron populations and quantify the effects on neural activity and defensive behaviors. Together these experiments will allow us to discern how these neurons regulate different defensive behaviors. Understanding basic mechanisms that guide or shift defensive behaviors along their spectrum will be essential for identifying abnormalities in these processes and for finding ways to correct them. This knowledge will ultimately impact mental illnesses where defensive behaviors are inappropriately extreme such as panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.\",\n",
       " \"Project Summary This project will develop new 3D visualization to improve stent-graft deployment during minimally-invasive endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) by overcoming limitations of 2D x-ray fluoroscopy (?fluoro?). 3D holographic guidance, navigation and control (3D GN&C) will be provided to decrease fluoro radiation dose burden to patients and OR staff during treatment of aortic aneurysms, particularly when deploying stent-grafts within hostile aortic anatomy, with challenges such as short and/or angled landing zones. Radiation-free 3D GN&C that is not limited by a 2D display will enable accurate stent-graft positioning with less irradiation, and thus fewer postoperative complications or need for re-intervention. This innovation will also expand the patient population eligible for EVAR, particularly those with highly unfavorable aortic anatomy, as the demand and utilization of the minimally-invasive approach continues to rise. 3D GN&C for EVAR will be developed and integrated with our computer-assisted surgical platform, the Intra- Operative Positioning System (IOPS). The Guidance subsystem digitally augments the surgical field novel with holographic representations of the virtual stent-graft deployment device within a patient-specific digital aortic model for targeting the aneurysm's landing zone using a modern, self-contained augmented/mixed reality headset. Navigation uses innovative methods to accurately track in real-time the 3D position and orientation of present and next-generation stent-graft delivery devices as well as sensor-coil-equipped wires and catheters in a low-level, safe electromagnetic (EM) field. Control indicators, based on EM tracking data and the guidance plan, also augment the aorta and stent-graft digital models to suggest maneuvers of the delivery device as it approaches the aneurysm?s proximal neck landing zone. The feasibility criteria are to demonstrate that 3D GN&C can be used to decrease fluoro radiation dose while accurately deploying EVAR stent-grafts within challenging aneurysm anatomy using state-of-the art delivery devices. The Specific Aims include evaluation of GN&C usability with a standard scale, a bench study to verify accurate stent-graft deployment within 3D-printed complex aortic morphology, and a preclinical porcine study to prove that, at this stage of R/R&D, 3D GN&C used as an adjunct to fluoro can decrease fluoro radiation dose relative to fluoro alone, with comparable stent-graft deployment accuracy and procedure time. Meeting all acceptance criteria of the Specific Aims will lead to a future clinical study in STTR Phase 2 to demonstrate safety, effectiveness, and efficiency of stent-graft deployment using 3D GN&C. Improved stent- graft placement and overcoming limitations of fluoro will pave the way to realizing the full clinical and economic benefits of EVAR over highly invasive open surgical repair. The ultimate reach goes beyond aneurysmal disease to include aortic dissection, additional endovascular procedures, and other minimally invasive applications to further benefit a broader population of patients and caregivers as well as global healthcare.\",\n",
       " 'Summary Abstract The ultimate goal of this project is the validation of a humanized endothelial monocyte- activating protein II (EMAP II) neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) for progression to clinical evaluation as a novel treatment for patients with influenza-associated lung injury. Infection with influenza virus (IAV) remains a major world-wide health threat to high-risk populations including the young and elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems. According to CDC data, influenza accounts for more than 23,000 deaths in US annually due to underlying respiratory and circulatory causes. The efficiency of influenza vaccination and antiviral drugs is compromised by the constant change in circulating viruses and the development of resistance in influenza virus strains. Allinaire Therapeutics, LLC is developing a first-in-class therapy which will not depend on the suppression of virus replication, and will be independent of the circulating influenza strain. Rather, the EMAP II mAb will target the pathogenic components of lung injury, including vascular endothelium apoptosis and leakage. We hypothesize that EMAP II is a key underlying factor in IAV-induced lung injury, and that a humanized EMAP II mAb will attenuate the development and serious consequences of lung damage produced by IAV. Here we present preliminary data demonstrating that IAV-induced pathologies are associated with dramatic increases in levels of EMAP II in the lung, and that administration of a rodent EMAP II mAb to influenza-A (IAV) infected mice ameliorates lung injury. Importantly, we have competed the creation of a fully humanized version of the EMAP II mAb - a crucial step towards targeting EMAP II clinically and creating a novel medicine. To evaluate our hypothesis and meet our drug discovery milestones, we plan to validate our humanized EMAP II mAb candidates in vitro in human lung cells exposed to IAV and recombinant EMAP II (Aim 1), and select the most potent and efficacious mAb to be tested in vivo in our established murine model of IAV-induced lung injury (Aim 2).',\n",
       " 'Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, rapidly progressive and fatal disease that is characterized by pulmonary arterial remodeling, severe pulmonary hypertension, and progressive right heart failure. The prognosis of PAH is poor with an approximate 15% mortality within 1 year on modern therapy. Over the past two decades, a number of medications for the treatment of PAH have been shown to improve patient symptoms and exercise capacity; however, none of the current treatments are curative and long-term prognosis remains poor. There remains a high unmet need for novel PAH targets and therapies that reverse the disease process and improve long-term health outcomes. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a 28 amino acid peptide hormone that activates VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors in the pulmonary vasculature and has been shown to relax pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, neutralize pulmonary vasoconstrictors, and inhibit pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Additionally, VIP improves right heart systolic and diastolic function and has broad anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic actions. VIP has been shown to be effective in reversing pulmonary vascular remodeling and prolonging survival in a murine model of PAH. PB1046is a recombinant acid fusion protein comprising biologically active VIP at the N-terminus and a physiologically inert repeating polymeric elastin-like peptide (ELP) at the C-terminus. The fusion of VIP to the ELP moiety significantly increases in vivo exposure through sustained release from the injection site, extended circulatory half-life and protection from enzymatic degradation. PB1046 is active as a fusion protein, i.e. the VIP moiety activates the receptor without a requirement to be cleaved or released from the ELP biopolymer. PhaseBio has tested PB1046 in a single-dose Phase 1 study in which the PK and PD enhancement of VIP via the ELP fusion was clearly demonstrated in the observed week-long PB1046 exposure profile and systolic blood pressure lowering effect after a single-dose in essential hypertension patients. Importantly, PB1046 demonstrated a clean single-dose safety/tolerability profile across the expected therapeutic dose range. In this SBIR Fast-Track proposal, we are applying for funding for the Phase 1b and Phase 2 studies of PB1046 in patients with PAH. PhaseBio will investigate the multi-dose safety, PK, and PD of PB1046 in an open-label, non- placebo controlled, multi-dose Phase 1b study of PB1046 in PAH patients who have an implanted pulmonary arterial pressure monitor (cardioMEMS). In this initial study, PB1046 will be administered as once weekly subcutaneously injections x 4 weeks at a dose level previously tested and shown to be safe and well tolerated in subjects from the single-dose Phase 1 study and in an ongoing Phase 1 multiple ascending dose study in ambulatory heart failure patients. When the safety, PK, and PD profile of PB1046 are confirmed in PAH subjects, a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 study of PB1046 will be initiated to investigate the potential beneficial effects of PB1046 on exercise capacity and hemodynamics in symptomatic PAH patients.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project aims to develop and characterize a sensor-based platform to track and analyze healthcare providers? hand hygiene quality and compliance automatically and continuously. Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) are the most common type of complication for patients who are hospitalized. In the United States, 1 out of every 20 hospitalized patients is affected by healthcare-associated infections. A good hand hygiene practice is one of the most effective measures to reduce transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to patients. However, recent data shows that on average U.S. healthcare providers clean their hands less than half of the times they should. Today most hospitals still rely on direct observation to monitor healthcare providers? hand hygiene compliance, which is very ineffective, expensive, time consuming and often results in biased data. Therefore, the development of a fully automated and easy-to-use platform to continuously monitor the healthcare providers? hand hygiene compliance can have significant impact on clinical management. In this research proposal, we will develop, prototype and test a low-power hand hygiene sensor and develop the analytics software for hand hygiene compliance monitoring. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a sensor-based platform to help healthcare providers improve their hand hygiene practices and reduce healthcare associated infections.',\n",

They constitute the majority of genomic DNA in many eukaryotes, and they dramatically shape genetic content by causing insertions, deletions, rearrangements and sequence duplications. Of increasing significance is the link of these mobile elements to diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Sequencing of human populations demonstrates that active transposable elements are substantially more prevalent than previously appreciated. The aims of this conference are to: 1) Apply recent innovations in high-throughput sequencing and genome analysis to the study of transposon biology and genome dynamics; 2) Discuss the discovery of cellular systems that inhibit transposon activity as examples of the evolutionary arms race between mobile DNA and their hosts; 3) Describe active transposition during neurogenesis and in tumor cells and raise questions about the role of mobile DNA in brain development and cancer; and 4) Discern mechanistic aspects of element mobility from bacteria to humans. This symposium will foster ties between leaders in the field of transposon function and biology with the pioneers of genome analysis, a link that is still tenuous and nascent. Discussions of transposon activity and genome dynamics will focus on mechanistic models. Methods applied to these problems will include molecular structures, biochemistry, expression studies and bioinformatic analyses. The transposons and hosts represented in this meeting include diverse examples from eubacteria, archaea, protists, plants and mammals.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy is a mainstay for induction and maintenance of remission in moderate- to-severe Crohn?s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), but is not effective for many, leading to protracted morbidity, hospitalizations, and surgery. Up to thirty percent of patients demonstrate no response to anti-TNF induction therapy (primary non-response), and an additional 10-15% lose response annually. With the emergence of novel therapeutics with different mechanisms of action, a priori prediction of response to a particular therapeutic class before exposure to therapy is increasingly important. Such a targeted approach will benefit the patient by avoiding unnecessary exposure to ineffective therapies and allowing attainment of earlier remission through initial selection of the therapy most likely to benefit. Importantly, it may also benefit society from a cost-effectiveness standpoint by reducing costs related to ineffective therapies and healthcare utilization. To date, clinical predictors of response to anti-TNF therapy have not been widely replicated and do not provide a reliable model for use in clinical practice. Our central hypothesis is that genetic polymorphisms related to inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis or the mechanisms of action of anti-TNF agents may influence response to these drugs, and that use of these polymorphisms to predict response to anti-TNF therapy will provide a precision medicine approach for improved quality and cost-effective care in the clinical setting. Our group has recently established the ability to use a genetic risk score to predict response to anti-TNF therapy in Crohn?s disease, and has demonstrated superiority of this model to one including only clinical variables for primary anti-TNF non-response. Whether a similar approach is also beneficial in ulcerative colitis is unknown, but is important to establish given different disease-related loci, disease phenotype, and likelihood of response. We plan to investigate our hypothesis through three specific aims. First, we will define the association of genetic polymorphisms with primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis using a large rigorously-phenotyped cohort and validate this in an external independent cohort. We will test these polymorphisms in a predictive model for anti-TNF non-response. In our second aim, we will define the role of genetics in determining durable response to therapy, with particular focus on their impact on drug pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. Finally, we will develop a cost-effectiveness model examining the utility of our precision medicine genotype-driven therapeutic algorithm compared to an unselective approach with respect to costs, clinical outcomes, and quality of life. We will determine the necessary predictive value threshold of this personalized approach to achieve cost-effectiveness on a societal scale. The long-term goal of this work is to understand and utilize human biology in inflammatory bowel disease to create a personalized, precise approach to therapy to improve outcomes and quality of life.',\n",
       " 'Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to revolutionize communication and environmental interaction abilities for people with extensive paralysis. Successful translation of BCIs to actual clinical use by such people depends on close and productive multidisciplinary interactions, and requires recognition of and attention to a set of crucial issues. The International BCI Meeting Series (1999, 2002, 2005, 2010, 2013 and 2016) convened a wide range of research groups and disciplines vital to BCI research and triggered many productive interactions and collaborations. This proposal, for the Seventh International BCI Meeting: ?BCIs: Not Getting Lost in Translation,? will be organized under the leadership of a Program Committee appointed by the BCI Society. The meeting will encourage and facilitate the development and translation of BCIs into clinically- viable devices through the following specific aims: 1) Convene and foster productive interactions among all the disciplines and constituencies whose cooperation is crucial to successful BCI research and development. No other venue brings them all together. 2) Present a concise and comprehensive update of the current state of BCI research and development. 3) Address in focused workshops the major topics critical for continued progress in BCI research and development. Additional topics of broad interest will be chosen based on workshop proposals and abstracts submitted by participants. 4) Promote the education and development of new researchers through the participation of many graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Networking events will encourage interactions between new and established researchers and particularly target underrepresented groups of researchers. 5) Convene the new BCI Society and encourage the involvement of young scientists in the society. This is crucial to generating new and fresh ideas in addition to translating state-of-the-art BCIs to clinical use. 6) Maximize the immediate and long-term Meeting impact through publication by the journal Brain Computer Interfaces of a special issue of peer-reviewed primary articles and focused reviews derived from the meeting.  In summary, this meeting will assemble scientists, engineers, clinicians and policymakers involved in BCI research and clinical use, review the present state of the field, address key issues critical to further progress, and promote the education and participation of young researchers. This meeting and the resulting comprehensive publications should, like its predecessors, contribute greatly to BCI research and development.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Complications from infections caused by difficult to treat Gram-negative pathogens resistant to multiple antibiotics (the MDR phenotype) has become a major public health threat. The basis of resistance in the most important members of this group, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is the poor penetration of the antibiotics through a relatively impermeable bacterial cell envelope and their expulsion (efflux) by various pumps expressed by the microorganisms. Consequently, the intracellular concentrations of antibiotic are kept below bactericidal levels. This proposal aims at creating new classes of diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents to combat efflux-based resistance by a project organized into two phases. First, we will develop genetically encoded fluorescent sensors activated by binding of antibiotics following their entry into the bacterial cytoplasm. This tool will enable us to measure antibiotic flux under different environmental conditions and on a single cell basis. During the second phase of the project, working with our industrial partner, we will implement a screening program, using a library of several hundred billion small molecules, to identify inhibitors targeting different components of efflux pumps. These inhibitors should activate the fluorescent detector by causing enhanced intracellular accumulation of the antibiotics resulting from inhibition of efflux. Functional studies are proposed to assess the ability of the active compounds to promote killing of P. aeruginosa by antibiotics that are normally expelled by the efflux pumps. Crystal structures of inhibitors bound to target proteins will be determined and these will guide medicinal chemistry efforts with the goal of creating additional derivatives with increased potencies and expanded spectrum, capable of inhibiting efflux pumps of other important Gram-negative pathogens.',\n",
       " 'Immature excitatory synapses in the perinatal brain contain high release probability (Pr) presynaptic terminals coupled to postsynaptic specializations with GluN2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors (hi-Pr, hi-GluN2B synapses). For over two decades, we have known that these immature synapses mature in an activity- dependent manner to low-Pr, low-GluN2B synapses, but the mechanisms that coordinate this transition, why it occurs, and how it contributes to circuit plasticity and stability remain controversial and are fundamental unanswered questions. Addressing these issues will identify basic mechanisms that control synapse development and that may be disrupted in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Disruption of the Arg/Abl2 kinase in mice yields a population of hi-Pr, hi-GluN2B synapses that persist into early adulthood. The persistence of these immature synapses drives a >40% net loss of hippocampal synapses between postnatal day (P) 21 and P42, and impairs synaptic plasticity and behavior. Building on these findings, we will identify new regulators of synapse maturation, and determine how they regulate synaptic plasticity and stability. In Aim 1, we will identify the cell surface receptors that activate Arg to coordinate the maturation from hi-Pr, hi- GluN2B synapses to low-Pr, low-GluN2B synapses. We provide preliminary data that integrin ?3?1 adhesion receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor ? (PDGFR?) act upstream of Arg to control synapse function and stability. We will use selective gene inactivation in the pre- and postsynaptic neurons along with genetic epistasis and rescue experiments to address how and where these receptors interact with Arg and each other to regulate Pr and postsynaptic GluN2B levels. In Aim 2, we will elucidate how Arg mediates GluN2B downregulation at the synapse. Arg-mediated signaling is critical to downregulate GluN2B during maturation. We identified the SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase and the NMDAR-associated protein BRAG1, both mutated in intellectual disability, as likely functional links between Arg and developmental GluN2B downregulation. We will use biochemical, cell-based, and genetic approaches to test how Arg interacts with SHP2 and BRAG1 to downregulate GluN2B function. In Aim 3, we will characterize how immature and mature synapses differentially contribute to plasticity and stability. We will use patterned glutamate uncaging at single synapses to test whether hi-Pr, hi-GluN2B and low-Pr, low-GluN2B synapses have altered ability to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in arg?/? mice. We will use in vivo imaging to examine how enlarged dendritic spines at hi- Pr, hi-GluN2B cortical synapses in arg?/? mice differ from normal spines in their plasticity and stability. Our studies will elucidate the mechanisms by which receptors act through Arg and its downstream targets to control Pr and NMDAR composition during synapse maturation. Disruption of these mechanisms may underlie the defects in synapse development, plasticity, and stability in intellectual disability and other brain disorders.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health problem in developing countries. More recently, the prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) has also been increasing worldwide in both developed and developing countries. NTM infection is clinically undistingable from tuberculosis and poses significant challenges in patient management, especialy in patients with chronic pulmonary TB (known to have 18% of NTM infections). The sputum smear, the most widely used diagnostic tool for TB is more than 100 years old, misses to detect half of tuberculosis cases, and is unable to differentiate between mycobacterial species. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Xpert MTB/RIF assay and other molecular tools, however, Xpert MTB/RIF is less sensitive than sputum culture (the current gold standard) and does not address the differential with growing NTM infections. In this application, we propose to leverage the scientific infrastructure and collaboration between the Center for Innovation in Global Health Technologies (CIGHT) at Northwestern University and the SEREFO HIV/TB Laboratory in Mali, at the University of Bamako (USTTB), to evaluate a new highly sensitive Multiplex MTB/NTM assay that can differentiate, at least M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC, TB causative agent) from the treatable and the most common NTM, M. avium complex (MAC). Preliminary data from the new assay suggest a performance superior to Xpert TB/RIF and comparable to sputum culture. The specific aims of this project are to evaluate the assay on fresh sputum samples from 1) patients with chronic TB-like disease, and 2) TB suspect patients with negative sputum smear. The study will evaluate the assay sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for both MTBC and NTM. The development and validation of such tools will significantly contribute into the fight against both TB and NTM diseases worldwide. Finally, the project assembled an excellent and complementary team to ensure the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project.',\n",
       " 'Recent advances in sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of a multitude of novel zoonotic viruses, some of which are closely related to known human pathogens. In most cases, only partial viral genome sequences were identified, and no infectious viruses were isolated, hampering research aimed at assessing the pathogenic potential of these novel viruses. A prime example of a sequence-based novel virus is Lloviu virus (LLOV), the newest member of the filovirus family. LLOV is closely related to the highly pathogenic ebola- and marburgviruses that cause severe disease in humans with extraordinarily high case fatality rates. The genomic viral RNA of LLOV was isolated from dead bats in Spain and is rudimentary. Important sequence elements located at the LLOV genome ends are missing. These include the antigenomic promoter that is essential for viral genome replication. Therefore, studies addressing LLOV genome replication and transcription, or pathogenesis have been impossible to date. In this proposal, we bring together expertise in the field of filoviral replication and transcription, rescue of filovirus clones, filovirus pathogenesis, and statistical modeling to generate infectious LLOV clones for in vitro and in vivo studies. By complementing the missing LLOV sequence with homologous sequences from related filoviruses, we have successfully established a hybrid LLOV minigenome system, enabling studies of LLOV replication and transcription for the first time. Based on this system, we will utilize LLOV minigenome systems in combination with statistical modeling to optimize the complemented promoter sequences (Aim 1). These optimized minigenome systems build the foundation for the generation and rescue of infectious full-length LLOV clones. The generated LLOV clones will then be characterized in in vitro studies. We will determine replication kinetics and host response signatures in primary human cells (Aim 2). Finally, we will perform pathogenesis studies with LLOV using a small animal model of filovirus infection (Aim 3). These studies will be instrumental to get a better understanding of the virulence of LLOV and its potential to cause disease in animals and humans. The platform developed in this project to assess the pathogenic potential of novel viruses can be adapted to other nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses and would therefore be of great benefit to the scientific community.',\n",
       " \"Abstract Systemic characterized production treatment which lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, potentially fatal autoimmune disease by abnormal activation of autoreactive T and B cells resulting in the of autoantibodies that cause widespread tissue and organ damage. Current  strategies rely heavily corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, are limited by suboptimal efficacy and by a significant burden of morbidity. , on Identification of alternative, safer and more comprehensive approaches targeting different elements of disease pathogenesis need to be explored. Our new published and preliminary data support the provocative and intriguing concept that erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced predominantly by the kidney in adults, plays an unanticipated role in controlling autoimmune response in lupus and improving clinical outcomes. Expanding beyond EPO's established role in erythrocyte development, our new data demonstrate that EPO a) improves disease severity in murine models of lupus, b) inhibits mouse and human Th17, T follicular helper cells (TFH), and Th1, while it increases T follicular regulatory cells (Tfr), c) induces and stabilizes Treg, and d) inhibits germinal center B cell formation and autoantibody production. We have identified molecular mechanisms that link EPO to some of these effects and show that they apply to humans given clinically used doses of EPO. EPO therapy, at doses used to correct anemia, augments frequencies of circulating CD4+CD25+CD127lo Treg in human subjects. Altogether, our findings support the following hypothesis to be tested in this project: EPO directly inhibits autoreactive Th17 and TFH, and simultaneously induces and maintains Treg and Tfr, together reducing disease severity in lupus. We will test this hypothesis by determining the effects of exogenous and kidney-derived EPO on murine lupus (aim 1), deciphering the mechanisms through which EPO selectively inhibits Th17 and TFH (aim 2), while EPO promotes Treg/Tfr induction and stability (aim 3). The proposed work will define the role of EPO as a mediator of self- tolerance and will delineate cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying EPO's effects on Th17, TFH, and Treg/Tfr. In addition to deciphering mechanisms, the studies will provide preclinical data on the utility of EPO as a therapeutic agent for improving disease activity in animals, findings that could potentially be translated to SLE patients.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary Stroke is the leading cause of physical disability worldwide and represents a global socioeconomic burden to human health. Despite an intense research effort that led to a plethora of targets and neuroprotectants to reduce stroke-induced brain injury in animals, the neuroprotection-based strategies resulted in little or no efficacy in numerous controlled clinical trials. These observations indicate that there should be a paradigm shift to enhance the translational efficacy issue and improve this devastating condition. Potential missing links that account for the translational hindrances include solely relying on infarct size without considering brain swelling to gauge neuroprotection in preclinical studies. In addition, there is a paucity of inclusion of risk factors in animal models of stroke, whereas comorbidities such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are frequently observed conditions in patients. The combined evidence supports the conclusion that there is a critical need to define stroke pathology focusing on brain swelling in metabolically compromised conditions, which is the overall scientific premise for the proposed research. Our recent findings showed that mice with diabetes and hyperlipidemia displayed disproportionately larger brain swelling compared to infarct volume, and the enhanced brain swelling was closely associated with an increased level of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a key signaling molecule for vascular permeability and angiogenesis. As obesity is a precipitating cause leading to metabolic disorders including diabetes and dyslipidemia, we hypothesized that VEGFR2 underlies obesity-enhanced brain swelling in stroke and that blocking VEGFR2 activation reduces the swelling and promotes functional recovery in obesity. Aim 1 will identify the role of VEGFR2 activation(s) on stroke-induced brain swelling in obese mice by assessing histological and molecular outcomes. In Aim 2, the loss and gain of function studies will evaluate the efficacy of VEGFR2 modulation on obesity-enhanced stroke-induced brain swelling using pharmacological and genetic approaches. Aim 3 will determine the impact of brain swelling on long-term stroke recovery by assessing long-term motor and cognitive function in obese mice where VEGF signaling is manipulated. At the completion of the project, we expect to obtain scientific evidence establishing the importance of VEGF signaling in obesity-enhanced brain swelling, the utility of VEGF inhibition as a treatment strategy in obesity stroke, and reducing brain swelling as an approach to promoting long-term stroke recovery. These results are expected to have a significant impact by providing strong justification for the repurposing of available VEGF-targeted anti- angiogenic/anti-cancer drugs to treat stroke patients with obesity and its associated comorbidities.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) has the opportunity to expand upon a recent pilot study conducted in conjunction with team members from University of Rochester and their subcontractors at Google[X] and Answer Informatics working with a social media monitoring software (SoMMS) entitled nEmesis. The software nEmesis identifies tweets suggestive of foodborne illness by following a user for up to two weeks after the user posts from a food establishment. The nEmesis software then assigns a score to the food establishment based on the quantity and severity of sick tweets. In the pilot program, researchers are observing whether restaurants with high scores also tended to have worse health inspection outcomes as compared to blind assigned controls.  In the proposed research, SNHD plans to expand the software by incorporating existing foodborne illness data, including foodborne illness complaints and customer's sanitation complaints, into the software and allowing it to influence the score. The score will then be used as a tool to determine when and where a regulatory response is needed such as a routine inspection, or an epidemiological investigation, depending on the severity.  By using this novel technology, SNHD will potentially be able to identify cases of unreported foodborne illness faster and investigate cases and potential outbreaks quickly resulting in the reduced spread of disease in the community. Furthermore, if the intervention of unifying the nEmesis software with other foodborne illness predictors is able to identify foodborne illness outbreaks more quickly, less valuable time will need to be spent in the field investigating foodborne illness concerns.  In the proposed research study, SNHD will evaluate whether the intervention has an effect on foodborne illness in the community by monitoring rates of lab?confirmed salmonellosis and E. coli O157:H7, quantity of foodborne illness reports, and quantity of customer complaints on restaurant sanitation. Secondly, SNHD will evaluate whether the intervention has an effect on time spent investigating verified foodborne illness complaints and verified customer sanitation complaints. This data will be collected over the life of the research and then compared to baseline data and analyzed for differences.\",\n",
       " 'Tuberculosis (TB) is an ongoing global health problem, causing an estimated 1.5 million deaths in 2014. In spite of growing drug resistance, few new drugs are in the development pipeline. Functions required by pathogen and host for disease to be established and progress would offer a broad range of novel targets. However, our understanding of the relevant functions remains limited, necessarily limiting our ability to target them with new therapies. Upon infection with the bacterium that causes TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), macrophage recognition of bacterial products triggers innate immune programs. One response induced following Mtb-mediated permeabilization of the phagosomal membrane is the type I interferon (IFN) response. ESX-1-mediated protein secretion, required for Mtb growth in macrophages and mice, was previously known to be required for phagosomal permeabilization. In recent work, we have determined that additional Mtb factors required for growth in the host are required to induce the type I IFN response, suggesting that loss of type I IFNs can serve as a surrogate marker for loss of critical bacterial functions. Whether type I IFNs play a causative role in TB pathogenesis or are simply a marker of phagosomal permeabilization is an area of active scientific debate, and small molecules that block this response would be useful tools for definitively answering this question. In the proposed work, we will (1) optimize a high-throughput assay to quantitate macrophage type I IFNs upon Mtb infection (2) apply that assay to a 50,000 compound library to identify small molecule inhibitors of the type I IFN response and (3) use secondary and tertiary assays to prioritize compounds for further study and development as potential anti-TB agents. Our screening assay will couple high-throughput ELISAs with imaging based quantitation of macrophage number to capture both type I IFN quantity and compound-related macrophage toxicity in the initial read-out. To prioritize compounds confirmed by retesting to be true hits, we will apply a series of secondary assays. We will first use in vitro growth assays to determine whether each compound has an effect on Mtb growing in culture alone. To determine which hits restrict Mtb intracellular growth, we will then use a high-content imaging assay to quantitate Mtb growth in compound- treated macrophages. We will then use a genetic tool to determine which hits impair Mtb-mediated phagosomal permeabilization. We will prioritize compounds for further study and development based on potency and toxicity, activity in secondary assays, predicted targets, and structural diversity. At the end of this work we anticipate having a series of small molecules that will serve both as tools to ask and answer critical questions about the role of the type I IFN response in TB infection and as starting points for the development of new anti-TB drugs targeting entirely novel bacterial and host functions.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Abstract: Influenza vaccination is the most effective means of preventing influenza virus infection and its more severe complications. Due to the changing nature of influenza viruses, active surveillance alongside regular updating of vaccine components and annual vaccination are necessary for vaccine protection. There is a need for annual evaluation of vaccine effectiveness (VE), which may vary from year to year. These estimates are critical to inform the medical community, maintain public confidence in the vaccine, and determine the effect of virus drift on protection. Modern study designs to assess VE require laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, sensitive and specific measures of vaccine receipt, and the use of a case test-negative design to control for differences in healthcare-seeking behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We propose to use these methods to estimate influenza VE in preventing influenza-associated ambulatory care visits in two health systems in Michigan, where we have been conducting annual assessments of VE since 2008. We will conduct surveillance at adult and pediatric outpatient clinics, and we will enroll patients seeking care for acute respiratory infections meeting a standard case definition. Vaccination status will be reported and documented, and considered with laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to estimate VE in preventing influenza- associated health care visits. Analyses will use the case test-negative design; those testing positive for influenza will be cases, those testing negative will be controls. Modifiers and confounders of VE such as age, health status, high-risk health conditions, education, time from illness onset to specimen collection, and calendar time will be assessed. We will also estimate the population-based incidence of medically-attended influenza and will identify infections due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory viruses in later years of the study. We will pilot methods to monitor the development of influenza virus resistance to antiviral medications which could inform similar studies carried out in a potential future influenza pandemic. In addition to our proposed influenza surveillance and VE assessment in the outpatient setting, we propose to continue our analyses of influenza VE and development of influenza antibodies among a prospectively followed cohort of households with children which has been in place since 2010. This cohort will be used to carry out complementary analyses of VE in preventing influenza illnesses of any severity which will be identified through ongoing active surveillance. Households in this cohort are followed for multiple years, enabling precise evaluations of repeated vaccination. Our current enrollment strategies will be augmented with targeted enrollment of households with children under age 3. Blood specimens will be collected from adults and children twice yearly; a third blood specimen will be collected from children < 3 years old 4 weeks after vaccination. The proposed work will enable the continuation of our established, coordinated, multi-faceted evaluation of influenza VE and development of antibodies in both ambulatory and community settings.',\n",
       " 'Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) continue to be major health burdens, each year causing millions of illnesses and tens of thousands of hospitalizations & deaths in the U.S. Although designed to reduce this burden, influenza vaccine has variable effectiveness (VE) from year to year due to host factors, environment, and virus & vaccine characteristics. Data from the US Flu VE Network helps CDC to evaluate vaccine policy, WHO to select vaccine strains and clinicians to use antivirals.  We propose a test-negative case-control (TNCC) study to determine influenza VE in UPMC, which serves diverse populations in 500 clinical sites. UPMC wins awards as one of the most wired health systems in the U.S. UPMC preferentially uses high-dose vaccine for persons >65 years, routinely records vaccination status in its electronic medical record and has a two-way interface with the state immunization registry.  Our proposal has a strong foundation of current participation in the US Flu VE Network with a multidisciplinary research team with the highest follow-up survey completion rate and enrollment numbers exceeding requirements. Our award-winning, high-throughput lab proposes analyses of influenza, RSV and HMPV. Each virus season definition is supported by >14,000 clinical multiplex respiratory virus tests and ongoing syndromic surveillance. We add agent-based modeling at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center. We are a CDC inpatient VE network site, thus we can compare VE for outpatients and inpatients.  Specific aims include: 1) Using TNCC methods, determine annual influenza and RSV (after licensure) VE against laboratory-confirmed, medically-attended, acute respiratory infections among outpatients in 3 age groups: 6 mos.-18 yrs., 19-49 yrs., and >50 yrs.; 2) Determine the annual, population-based burden of influenza, RSV and hMPV in the same age groups, using the participating primary care sites as the source population, conduct sensitivity analyses and agent-based modeling on the impact of vaccination options; 3) Prepare for studies related to an influenza pandemic, describing the epidemiology, effectiveness of antivirals and/or pandemic vaccines, including pilot studies on patient portal/phone enrollment.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  The dimorphic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc), is endemic to the Midwestern and Southeastern US and is the most frequent cause of fungal respiratory infection. Yeast cells thrive in the intracellular environment of macrophages (M?) until these phagocytes are activated by cytokines such as interferon-? or granulocyte M? colony-stimulating factor. The transcriptional elements that license M? to promote clearance of the fungus are largely unknown. We have discovered that the transcription factors hypoxia inducing factors (HIF)-1? and -2? calibrate the behavior of M? infected with Hc. In a recent publication, we reported that the lack of HIF-1? in M? exacerbates infection with Hc by promoting the generation of interleukin (IL)-10. The absence of both HIF-1? and -2? further exaggerates IL-10 production by M?. Excessive IL-10 dampens the ability of activating cytokines to arm the anti-Hc function of M?. We demonstrate that Hc induces HIFs and that pharmacologically inflating HIF accrual enhances the anti-Hc activity of mouse and human M?. These data triggered two hypotheses: 1) HIFs in M? are required to temper IL-10 generation, and 2) pharmacologically amplifying expression of HIFs arms M? to exert anti-Hc activity. To test these hypotheses, we propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will examine the interplay between HIFs and metabolism. Specifically, we will determine if a glycolytic metabolite initiates and tumor necrosis factor-? sustains expression of HIFs. We will determine if overproduction of a specific metabolite by infected HIF-deficient cells promotes IL-10 release. Specific Aim 2 will examine how HIFs regulate IL-10. We will determine if miRNA-27a is involved in the generation of IL-10 and if IL-10 modifies the metabolism of HIF- deficient cells. We will test the possibility that a metabolic product regulates the expression of an miRNA that controls the decay of IL-10 transcription. We will ascertain if IL-1receptor antagonist is a downstream effector of IL-10-mediated inhibition of M? function. Specific Aim 3 will investigate how pharmacological activation of HIFs promotes the anti-Hc activity of M???We will identify a mechanism and the in vivo effect of these agents. We expect these studies to provide a greater understanding of the regulation of M? function in response to Hc.',\n",
       " 'The glutamatergic synapses are the main excitatory synapses in the brain. Abnormal synapse formation and plasticity are responsible for numerous diseases, such as intellectual disability, autism, neuropsychiatric and degenerative disorders. The signaling mechanisms controlling their assembly and plasticity have not been fully understood. Our preliminary studies lead to the surprising finding that components of the highly conserved cell polarity signaling pathways are important regulators. We found that components of both planar cell polarity (PCP) and apical-basal polarity (A-BP) pathways are localized in developing excitatory synapses and interact with multiple key presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins. In this proposal, we propose to test several hypotheses on how these key cell polarity components regulate glutamatergic synapse formation and plasticity.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY HIV persistence in the face of antiretroviral therapy necessitates lifelong treatment of infected individuals. HIV infection persists within a reservoir of CD4+ T cells that harbor latent integrated virus. The HIV reservoir may also reside in other long lived cell types such as macrophages, or may be maintained by HIV ongoing replication in the face of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) due to lowered antiretroviral penetration in some anatomical compartments, or decreased sensitivity to ARVs due to cell-to-cell HIV spread. It is possible that multiple mechanisms of HIV persistence may play a role. Several approaches are being tested to target the HIV reservoir for elimination, including ?shock and kill? strategies, which reinitiate HIV gene expression and specifically eliminate infected cells following viral replication, and gene therapy approaches to excise the HIV genome. In addition, there are emerging strategies that recognize and kill infected cells directly. Absent from these approaches is a comprehensive understanding of the phenotypes and characteristics of the cellular source(s) of the HIV reservoir under antiretroviral therapy (ART). Lymph nodes may serve as a central reservoir for HIV persistence due to their high concentration of lymphocytes, extensive cellular interactions within the lymph node which may allow HIV spread between cells, and limited ARV penetration. Multiple CD4+ T cells subtypes have been proposed be the source of the HIV reservoir, but it is still unclear which cell subtype is most crucial to maintain it, and whether there is inter-patient heterogeneity in reservoir composition which depends on ART regimen or other clinical parameters. Furthermore, the composition of the HIV reservoir in Sub-Saharan Africa has rarely been investigated, despite the massively high prevalence of people living with HIV/AIDS in this region, as well as the extensive rollout of ART in at the epicenter of the HIV epidemic in South Africa and the consequent large and diverse ART suppressed patient population which can be studied to understand HIV persistence. In the proposed study, we aim to quantitatively determine the cell type(s) responsible for HIV production in the lymph nodes of ART-treated patients. We will use a novel approach utilizing single cell RNA-Seq to derive both the transcriptional profile of individual host cells and their intracellular viral transcript levels and viral sequences. This will enable us to deeply characterize which cell type(s) are infected, the number of viral transcripts per cell, and the transcriptional changes associated with infection. We will also determine the HIV reservoir size and composition in the lymph nodes of each ART suppressed individual by the established techniques of detecting HIV DNA copies and using viral outgrowth assays. We will test lymph nodes from a large number of study participants, enabled by a unique combination of very high infection prevalence and state of the art hospital facilities at the study's base in Durban. We will investigate common elements of the HIV reservoir across participants, and characterize reservoir heterogeneity.\",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Modifying stem cells by insertion of anti-HIV gene or gene editing technologies can theoretically result in an HIV proof immune system in patients after stem cell transplantation. The success of the ?Berlin patient? receiving CCR5 negative cells for transplantation has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. Thereafter, a myriad gene therapy trials targeting CCR5 to prevent HIV entry have been tried with inconclusive results. Recent, mathematical modeling data suggests that CCR5 disrupting strategies alone will fail to suppress HIV load unless combined with a suicide gene. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new combination gene therapy vectors and methodologies that can be used to enrich vector modified stem cells before transplantation to ensure robust engraftment. Our proposal addresses these issues via a two-step vector system that incorporates multiple safety as well as selection features. Our vector 1 is a conditional vector that expresses the TK-SR39 gene only in the presence of HIV Tat protein. TK-SR39 is a TK mutant that is highly potent at killing cells in the presence of small amounts of Ganciclovir, a drug routinely used for Herpes virus treatment in HIV infected individuals. Furthermore, our vector incorporates an added unique feature that it also transiently expresses a Tat inducible modified CD4 (CD4mod) that is a CD4 molecule lacking the cytoplasmic domain as well as HIV Env binding region. This will provide a mechanism to purify modified cells using immunomagnetic beads while eliminating its use as a receptor for HIV entry. To induce transient expression of CD4mod we will use vector 2 that expresses HIV Tat and a CRISPR-CCR5 cassette to knockout CCR5. Thus, cells modified by this two-step vector system will have CCR5 knockout as well as conditional expression of TK-SR39 and CD4mod that will allow easy selection of cells. Thus, these cells encompass multiple layers of anti-HIV activity as 1) because of CCR5 knock out they will resist HIV infection 2) in case of CXCR4 virus emergence, the cytotoxic potential of TK-SR39 can be utilized via GCV administration 3) this will lead to rapid death of infected cells thereby minimizing virus spread and preventing establishment of latent reservoirs. The superiority of our approach lies in targeting the virus at multiple fronts and allowing a method to sort modified cells that is the key to long-term engraftment in vivo.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An occupational health and safety surveillance program in Montana would work to accomplish three main goals in order to bridge the gap between occupational health surveillance and prevention and safety activities. This program, Montana Occupational Health and Safety Surveillance (MOHSS), would accomplish this through three primary activities that all together can provide valuable information and lead to occupational health improvement across the state. MOHSS will collect, report, and analyze the NIOSH Occupational Health Indicators as a baseline for occupational health surveillance. The indicators collected on an annual basis will allow for an analysis of trends in occupational health These will be used to monitor Montana's occupational safety and health landscape, reveal areas in need of more in-depth surveillance, and guide prevention efforts. MOHSS will also use interagency collaborations to improve the quantity and quality of occupational health data collected and used for occupational health surveillance. MOHSS will work to improve access to and quality of existing systems as well as explore new data sources. In order to accomplish this, MOHSS will collaborate with other agencies and bureaus within Montana to take advantage of the large variety of surveillance systems already in place. These include the MT Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS), DLI Research and Analysis, and other organizations.  Finally, MOHSS will create and maintain active communication with stakeholders in occupational safety and health to provide avenues through which information from MOHSS can reach agencies able to act in the findings. Findings from MOHSS will guide interventions and preventative policy targeting occupational health and safety hazards most efficiently. These relationships will also provide external guidance to MOHSS and provide council on aspects of occupational health of particular importance or concern.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a wide range of nervous system pathologies that are generally characterized by progressive loss of cognitive and/or motor function, memory loss and dementia. With the increasing age of the population in the United States, the number of people affected by neurodegenerative diseases is expected to triple in the coming years, with most patients afflicted with Alzheimer?s disease. Unfortunately, there are limited or no treatment options for most neurodegenerative diseases. A growing number of studies suggest that deficits in vascular function within the central nervous system can be precipitating events that initiate neurodegeneration. Normally, the blood brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from plasma components that would otherwise lead to cellular damage. However, chronic BBB breakdown results in leakage of serum components from the bloodstream into the central nervous system. Over time, buildup of toxic metabolites leads to cellular damage and neurodegeneration. The BBB is comprised of endothelial cells surrounded by mural cells, referred to as pericytes, and astrocytes. In both mouse and humans, loss of pericyte coverage at the BBB is associated with increased vascular leakage and the formation of calcified plaques. In humans, this defect can result in reduced cognitive function and Parkinson?s disease-like symptoms. Thus, pericyte coverage is essential for maintaining BBB integrity and limiting neurodegeneration. Despite this important role, we know little concerning how the BBB pericyte lineage is established and maintained during development. This is largely due to the lack of reliable and specific markers for BBB pericytes. This knowledge gap hinders both our understanding of BBB pericyte ontogeny and our ability to specifically manipulate this essential type in experimental settings. To address these issues, we will apply genome-wide approaches using the zebrafish as a model system to identify enhancer elements that are specific to BBB pericytes. In particular, we will identify regions of chromatin in the zebrafish genome that are specifically open in BBB pericytes. We will take advantage of double transgenic zebrafish that enable enrichment of pericyte populations. By isolating pericyte nuclei from several different tissues and comparing their open chromatin profiles, it will be possible to identify elements that are putative enhancers in BBB pericytes. We will then test activity of putative BBB pericyte enhancers in zebrafish reporter assays. We will take advantage of the ability to perform in vivo reporter assays in zebrafish to assess candidate BBB pericyte-specific enhancers. Together these studies will yield novel insights into the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks that contribute to pericyte function and maintenance of the BBB.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary Current clinical practice in screening tests involves subjective interpretation of patients' test results such as mammograms by trained experts. Substantial variability is often reported between radiologists' visual classifications of breast images, impacting the accuracy and consistency of common screening tests including mammography. Factors related to patients and raters and the technology itself may impact experts' ratings of breast cancer and density, an important predictor of breast cancer. However, the study of accuracy and consistency between radiologists' ratings in large-scale cancer longitudinal screening studies is challenging due to the ordinal nature of the classifications and many experts each contributing ratings. Newly emerging processes including automated 3-D procedures provide exciting potential for estimating breast density in routine clinical settings. Currently very few statistical approaches and summary measures exist to model the consistency and accuracy between several radiologists' ordinal ratings. Further, few methods can investigate the influence of patient and radiologist characteristics, the use of automated procedures and comparison of the different technologies upon accuracy and consistency. Our goals are to develop new statistical methods based upon generalized linear mixed models and latent variable models to study accuracy and consistency amongst many experts in large-scale screening studies. Our approach can flexibly accommodate many experts' ratings and other factors to examine their influence on consistency and accuracy. We will derive novel model-based summary measures of agreement and accuracy. We will implement our new statistical methods in recent large-scale breast imaging studies. A key strength of our proposed research is to provide medical researchers with a flexible modeling approach and novel summary measures that utilize all the data simultaneously, where conclusions can be drawn about the consistency between typical experts and patients in the populations, greatly increasing efficiency and power. The study of patient and rater characteristics on the levels of consistency and accuracy between raters' classifications will translate to improvements in training radiologists and practice of interpreting mammograms, and ultimately, a more effective breast screening procedure.\",\n",
       " 'Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the US. Yet, its acute severity is not explained by traditional risk factors. Additionally, while infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis are at very high risk for incident asthma, little is known about the mechanisms linking these two conditions. These major knowledge gaps have hindered efforts to develop bronchiolitis treatment strategies and to prevent asthma in this high risk population. The 35th Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration (MARC-35) study (U01AI087881; Camargo, PI) is an ongoing 17-center cohort study that enrolled 1,016 hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis during 2011- 2014. In this racially-, ethnically-, and geographically-diverse cohort, investigators have collected high-quality biospecimens, including nasopharyngeal airway samples at the index hospitalization. Follow-up data include biannual parent interviews, medical record reviews, and in-person exam at age 6 years, with >90% follow-up to date. The present R01 project would extend this large well-characterized bronchiolitis cohort by profiling the gene expression of both nasopharyngeal airway microbiome (metatranscriptome) and host response (transcriptome) in the setting of bronchiolitis, and by examining their relations to both acute (bronchiolitis severity) and chronic (incident asthma) outcomes. In Aim 1, we will examine the relations among the airway microbiome profiles, host transcriptomic profiles, and acute severity of bronchiolitis. In Aim 2, we will determine the relations among the airway microbiome and host transcriptomic profiles in infants with bronchiolitis, and the risk of developing childhood asthma. Finally, using a systems biology approach, Aim 3 will define bronchiolitis endotypes by integrating clinical, virus, immunology (e.g., IgE), microbiome (composition and function) and host transcriptome data, and determine their associations with both the acute and chronic outcomes. Our pilot data lend compelling support to our hypotheses. The present R01 project will provide a unique opportunity to define the pathobiology of bronchiolitis through examining the functional activity of microbiome and host response in the airway. Furthermore, we will also determine the mechanisms linking bronchiolitis to asthma, by investigating young infants with bronchiolitis (median age, 3 months) ? a natural experiment during a critical period of lung development. The project will provide a strong evidence base for developing targeted interventions for acute bronchiolitis treatment and asthma primary prevention (e.g., through modulation of microbiome and immune responses). The investigators are NIH-funded researchers with international expertise in all relevant fields. The study matches well with the 2013 NIAID Strategic Plan.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary / Abstract Heart disease accounts for 1 in 7 of all deaths in the USA, the majority of which are caused by atherosclerotic plaques. Atherosclerosis and its complications are the leading cause of disability and deaths worldwide. In addition, they also significantly contribute to the health care financial burden. Therefore, there is a clear need for the development of novel therapies aimed at new signaling pathways and gene targets. Treatment strategies targeting broad inflammatory and metabolic gene programs are desirable to achieve complete cessation and reversal of plaque development. There is an increasing appreciation that transcriptionally dynamic macrophages are a key player in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We have established that CITED2 represents a molecular ?switch,? that promotes anti-atherogenic macrophage activation while repressing harmful pro-atherogenic phenotypes. Our preliminary studies revealed that, (a) CITED2 expression is attenuated in human and murine atherosclerotic plaque macrophages; (b) Anti-atherogenic stimuli enhance and pro-atherogenic agents attenuate CITED2 expression in human, and murine macrophages; (c) Deficiency of Cited2 enhance macrophage lipid accumulation and foam cell formation; (d) Reduction in Cited2 expression results in heightened basal levels of lipid influx gene while significantly diminished lipid metabolism and efflux gene expression; (e) Myeloid-specific deficiency of Cited2 significantly elevated high-fat diet induced atherosclerotic lesion formation in vivo. (f) Cited2 executes atheroprotective functions by cooperating with PPAR? while antagonizing IRF1 activation in macrophages. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that CITED2 is a critical negative regulator of macrophage pro-inflammatory activation, foam cell formation and atherogenesis. We propose following aims to determine the precise role macrophage CITED2 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In Aim 1: To dissect the precise molecular mechanism by which CITED2 regulates macrophage inflammatory and lipid homeostasis gene expression. In Aim 2: To investigate the role of CITED2 in macrophage lipid homeostasis and foam cell formation. In Aim 3: To examine the impact of myeloid-CITED2 deficiency on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have expanded our fundamental insights into the molecular role of CITED2 in atherogenesis. Thus, the outcome of our studies may provide novel opportunities to design therapeutic intervention in the treatment of human lipid metabolic disorders.',\n",
       " \"Abstract Traditional strategies of vaccine development suffer from long-term and costly manufacture, and as a result, often fail to respond rapidly to newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. By contrast, messenger RNA (mRNA) is rising as a new technology platform to develop vaccines ?on demand? against viral pathogens, offering attractive advantages such as cell-free production, non-viral delivery, as well as simple, fast and cost- effective manufacture. Further improvement upon mRNA's stability and translation efficiency, understanding of their immune mechanisms, and evaluation of their protective efficacy will facilitate the development of next- generation mRNA vaccine technologies against diverse viral pathogens. Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic, emerging infectious virus posing a continuous threat to public health worldwide. There are currently no MERS vaccines approved for use in humans. MERS-CoV spike (S) protein, particularly its receptor-binding domain (RBD), is an important vaccine target. We have previously shown that MERS-CoV RBD contains a critical neutralizing domain capable of inducing strong cross-neutralizing antibodies and protecting human dipeptidyl peptidase 4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice against MERS-CoV infection with outstanding efficacy. However, production of subunit vaccines and other traditional vaccines has limitations, such as low expression and complex purification. To address these unmet challenges, we propose to rationally design and evaluate novel mRNA vaccines, using MERS-CoV as a model pathogen and MERS-CoV S protein as a target antigen. We hypothesize that with appropriate modification and optimization, MERS-CoV S protein RBD-based mRNA vaccines will demonstrate improved stability, increased translation efficiency, and enhanced immunogenicity in both mouse and non-human primates (NHP) models, with protective efficacy on par with the RBD-based subunit vaccine. The specific aims are to (1) rationally design MERS-CoV mRNA vaccines with improved stability and translation efficiency, (2) carefully optimize mRNA formulations and immunization regimens towards in-vivo evaluation of their immunogenicity and mode of action in wild-type mice, and (3) comprehensively evaluate protective efficacy of MERS-CoV mRNA vaccines and elucidate their protective mechanisms in hDPP4-Tg mice and NHPs. Of note, we will also examine the utility of new technologies such as microfluidics and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of B-cell response in mRNA vaccine development and evaluation. The long-term goal is to develop a safe and effective mRNA vaccine that is able to (1) maintain sufficient quantity and quality suitable for industrial- scale production, and (2) meet the WHO Target Product Profiles for rapid onset of immunity in outbreak settings and long-term protection of people at high ongoing risk of MERS-CoV. Together, the proposed project will shed light on protective mechanisms of mRNA vaccines, and provide much-needed information and guidelines for developing mRNA vaccines against diverse viral pathogens with pandemic potential.\",\n",
       " 'Neural communication is governed by the release of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles at the synaptic active zone (AZ). Several fundamental forms of neurotransmitter release are present at synapses, including synchronous mono- and multi-vesicular release, asynchronous and spontaneous release. Each of these release mechanisms plays important and distinct roles in synaptic development and function. However, despite several decades of research, how these canonical forms or release are organized and regulated in central synapses is poorly understood. This includes some of the most fundamental features of release, including the number, spatial organization and reuse of release sites supporting different forms of release, all of which remain largely undetermined because of the extremely small size and relative inaccessibility of central synapses to conventional recording techniques. Moreover, how the spatiotemporal properties and reuse of the release sites are regulated by neural activity is largely unknown. To overcome these limitations, we developed a nanoscale-resolution imaging approach that in combination with a pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator genetically tagged to the vesicle lumen, allows us to resolve individual vesicle fusion events at the AZ with ~27 nm precision. With this approach we have uncovered the presence of multiple distinct release sites in central synapses and demonstrated that their spatiotemporal properties are regulated by neural activity. By complementing this approach with computational single-molecule tools we are also able to robustly detect all other canonical forms of release. Our approach also permits us to visualize and track translocation of individual synaptic vesicles to the AZ, a critical time-limiting step in the refilling of the release sites during neural activity. Here we propose to combine this nanoscale-resolution imaging approach with advanced computational, genetic and pharmacological tools to study, at a single-vesicle level, the mechanisms governing organization and regulation of the canonical forms of neurotransmitter release at individual central synapses. We will further define the mechanisms governing vesicle translocation to the release sites and their activity-dependent regulation. These studies will provide major new insights into fundamental mechanisms of synaptic function.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  Capsular polysaccharides are essential to the virulence of many organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the major cause of community-acquired pneumonia and an important cause of sepsis, meningitis, and otitis media (middle ear infections). In this bacterium, capsules provide resistance against host- mediated opsonophagocytosis and are important in both infection and nasopharyngeal colonization. Ninety- eight distinct capsular serotypes have been identified, each consisting of unique combinations of sugars and linkages. All but two of the serotypes are synthesized by the Wzy polymerase-dependent mechanism in which repeat units built on the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane are transported to the outer face of the membrane where they are polymerized into polysaccharide. Nearly all capsules in Gram-positive bacteria, and a large percentage capsules in Gram-negative bacteria, are synthesized by this mechanism.  Knowledge of specific factors and mechanisms that could potentially disrupt capsule or its synthesis and thereby abrogate virulence is lacking. In studies of the Wzy pathway in S. pneumoniae, we detected a novel inhibitory activity that reduces capsule levels in multiple serotypes by more than ten-fold. Initial characterization showed the inhibitory component to be a small, heat stable molecule, likely a peptide. The inhibitory activity was present in a complex mixture that is readily available and amenable to biochemical, analytical, and physical analyses. The aims of the proposed project are to: 1) identify the inhibitor, and 2) initiate studies to determine the mechanism by which it affects capsule.  The results of these studies will have particular significance to understanding novel mechanisms affecting capsule synthesis. Importantly, they could lay the groundwork for identifying inhibitors capable of reducing capsule levels during infection, thereby reducing virulence of the organism. Because mechanisms for synthesizing capsule are shared by many bacteria, the results may also have broad impact. Consequently, these and follow-up studies will have a high potential to positively impact point of care of patients infected by capsule-producing bacteria, including those resistant to antibiotics.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by progressive demyelination of axons in the central nervous system (CNS). One major approach to developing new MS treatments is the development of therapeutics that can act on myelin-producing oligodendrocytes to enhance the production and/or stability of myelin. Toward this end, it is important to identify potential drug targets that are selectively enriched in oligodendrocytes and capable of promoting myelin stability. GPR37 is a nervous system-specific G protein-coupled receptor that is highly expressed in oligodendrocytes. We performed proteomic analyses of brain tissue from GPR37 knockout (Gpr37-/-) mice and found that one of the most dramatically down-regulated proteins was the myelin- associated glycoprotein (MAG), which is a myelin-enriched protein known to regulate myelin stability. In parallel studies, we found that GPR37 and MAG form complexes in cells. Since MAG-deficient mice are known to exhibit significantly more severe demyelination in response to insults, we explored the Gpr37-/- mice in the cuprizone model of demyelination and found that these mice exhibit a much more dramatic loss of myelin than wild-type mice in response to cuprizone treatment. Given the striking similarity in phenotypes between Gpr37-/- and MAG-deficient mice, we hypothesize that the interaction between GPR37 and MAG exerts effects on oligodendrocyte physiology and myelination. This hypothesis will be tested by i) dissecting the structural determinants of the interaction between GPR37 & MAG and ii) studying mutual regulation between GPR37 and MAG in cultured oligodendrocytes from Gpr37-/- mice. These studies will shed light on the interaction and mutual regulation between the oligodendrocyte-enriched proteins GPR37 and MAG, which will lead to a greater understanding of both proteins in the regulation of oligodendrocyte physiology and myelination. Moreover, the studies proposed here will enhance our knowledge of the action of GPR37 in regulating myelination and thereby set the stage for the targeting of this receptor by novel therapeutics aimed at treating MS and other myelination disorders. ! !',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Chronic rejection is one of the leading causes of graft loss following transplantation. It is also one of the most significant and unresolved problems requiring investigation and new therapies. The microvascular endothelium is a critical interface between the donor graft and the recipient. Maintaining quiescent and pro-tolerogenic graft endothelium ameliorates chronic rejection. Studies have shown that blockade of the co-inhibitory pathway and their local effects to promote immunoregulation leads to graft rejection. This may be due to the impairment of Foxp3+ regulatory T cell (Tregs)?mediated graft tolerance. My research proposal focuses on improving graft survival and potentially supporting the induction of tolerance within the graft that will benefit all transplant recipients. We found that the endothelial receptor Tie2 and its ligands Angiopoietins (Angpt1/2) maintain the integrity and immunogenicity of endothelial cells. Administration of Angpt1, an activator of Tie2 pathway, and blocking of deactivator ligand Angpt2, (which is otherwise associated with chronic rejection), enhances graft survival and function. We hypothesize that Tie2-mediated signals regulate endothelial PD-L1, and novel PD-L1 agonists will facilitate a tolerogenic intragraft microenvironment that will foster long-term graft survival and local immunoregulation. I will test this hypothesis by two specific aims: 1) To determine Tie2 mediated regulation of PD-L1 and 2) To identify small molecules that regulate PD-L1 expression. We will use endothelial cells that differentially express Tie2. In these studies we will evaluate the Tie2 mediated regulations of different immunoregulatory genes including PD-L1. Luciferase-based assay and high content robotic microscopy workstations will be used to identify PD-L1 agonists in drug libraries. This application for an R03 is intended to allow us to understand the regulation of endothelial PD-L1 and discover novel endothelial PD-L1 agonists by using High Throughput Screening (HTS). At the end of the project, we will be able to identify several agonists of endothelial PD-L1,that will be tested further for biological activity.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY The 2014 President?s Cancer Panel called underuse of HPV vaccines ?a serious, but correctable threat to progress against cancer.? The Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel, more recently, identified expanding the use of HPV vaccines as a top priority for cancer prevention, especially in medically underserved populations. The overarching goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel, theory-based message framing intervention to accelerate HPV vaccine uptake among African American adolescents. Based on prospect theory and the health belief model, this project aims to 1) develop culturally appropriate messages framed in gains and losses and pretest these messages through community engagement; 2) determine whether/how the effects of message framing (gain vs. loss) on African American parents? acceptance of the HPV vaccine are moderated by their prior beliefs about HPV and the HPV vaccine; and 3) evaluate the efficacy of a message framing intervention rooted in message targeting principles utilizing mobile tablets for efficient targeting through a clinic-based randomized trial. The proposed project will generate key insights into the persuasive effects of message framing as applied to the promotion of HPV vaccination. It will produce solid empirical evidence surrounding a novel, theory-based message framing intervention aimed at accelerating HPV vaccine uptake among African American adolescents. Addressing a critical aspect of health disparities disadvantaging the African American community, this research represents a systematic and timely effort to respond to the call of the 2014 President?s Cancer Panel on the urgency of optimizing communication strategies for promoting HPV vaccination among key stakeholders.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary:  Ovarian cancer (OCa) is the fifth leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States. Intrinsically resistant and recurring ovarian cancers are a terminal disease that cannot be cured with existing therapeutics. Considering the molecular and genetic heterogeneity of tumors, we hypothesize that efficacious OCa therapy can be developed by determining the genetic abnormalities found in tumors of individual OCa patients and designing personalized therapy that can overcome patient-specific multi-drug resistance (MDR). We propose to develop robust nanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs) for the co-delivery of front-line and second-line OCa chemotherapeutics (cisplatin or cisplatin plus gemcitabine) and siRNA cocktails targeting MDR genes. A unique endosomal escape mechanism will be elucidated and is expected to be generally applicable to the rational design of nanocarriers for efficient delivery of biologics in vivo. This project will not only provide new fundamental insights nanomedicine research, but also holds great promise for clinical translation for the personalized treatment of resistant OCa. Aim 1: Develop NCP/siRNAs and evaluate their in vitro effects on resistant OCa cell lines. Two NCP/siRNAs formulations with chemotherapeutics in the core and siRNAs targeting MDR in the shell will be developed and characterized. The in vitro gene silencing and cytotoxicity will be evaluated in resistant OCa cells. Aim 2: Evaluate the anticancer efficacy of NCP/siRNAs in orthotopic mouse tumor models of resistant OCa. The general toxicity and anticancer efficacy of NCP/siRNAs will be assessed in mouse models. Aim 3: Actively target NCP/siRNAs by incorporating Her2/neu antibody fragments into the NCP/siRNAs shell. Small protein Her2/neu antibody fragments will be conjugated to a lipid and incorporated into the outer shell of NCP/siRNAs and the resulting nanoparticles will be tested in Her2/neu high expressing and Her2/neu low expressing resistant OCa tumor models to evaluate changes in pharmacokinetics, tumor deposition, and efficacy. Aim 4: Evaluate the anticancer efficacy of NCP/siRNAs and NCP/siRNAs/H2A in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models of resistant OCa. The expression of MDR-associated genes will be analyzed in OCa tumor PDX samples collected by the Mayo clinic. Personalized therapy will be designed entailing chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the choice of siRNAs targeting MDR genes. Confirmed platinum-resistant tumor cells will be used to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of NCP/siRNAs in orthotopic PDX OCa mouse models. Tumors from Her-2/neu receptor positive and negative patients will be further evaluated for anticancer efficacy by NCP/siRNAs/H2A.  Through these aims we seek to establish a new paradigm for the treatment of resistant OCa. NCP/siRNAs can provide personalized therapy for OCa patients and achieve greatly enhanced anticancer efficacy in resistant OCa. As the standards of care for cervical and other cancers, cisplatin-based NCP/siRNAs can have broad impact on treating other resistant cancers.',\n",
       " 'Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and permanent disability in the United States affecting more than 1.7 million individuals each year. TBI not only results in tissue damage and cell death, but can perturb surviving neuronal function, leading to alterations in neural connectivity, abnormal plasticity, and network dysfunction. Due to the inherent diversity in post-TBI dysfunction, a critical need exists for therapeutic interventions that target multiple injury mechanisms. Development of such multi-prong therapeutic approaches could have enormous clinical, social, and economic benefit. However, implementation of this strategy requires the identification of endogenous molecular cascades capable of regulating multiple protective/restorative pathways. The discovery that the Rit GTPase (RIT1) is dramatically down-regulated following cortical contusion injury (CCI) prompted studies to explore the contribution of Rit-directed signaling to functional recovery following TBI. Drawing upon a collection of RIT1 transgenic mice, exciting preliminary data demonstrate that Rit activation reduces in vivo neurodegeneration and alleviates cognitive dysfunction following CCI. Additional data suggest that Rit is critical for post-TBI neurogenesis and promotes synaptic integrity by reducing post-contusion synaptic loss. Collectively these data are the first to demonstrate a significant role for Rit in directing neuroprotection and neuroplasticity following TBI, and suggest that Rit functions as a linchpin regulator of multiple injury response mechanisms following CCI. The overall hypothesis is that: (1) Rit plays a key role in cellular and functional recovery from brain trauma, and (2) that activation of Rit signaling therefore has broad therapeutic potential in the setting of TBI. Three complementary aims guide our studies. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that contusion-dependent Rit loss disrupts gene expression programs that promote neural survival and neurogenesis. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the extent to which Rit signaling controls neuronal survival after contusive brain injury. The efficacy of Rit-targeted therapies will be evaluated using an inducible knock-in mouse model to permit Rit activation over a clinically relevant period of hours to days after the onset of brain injury. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that Rit signaling preserves synaptic function following traumatic brain injury using transgenic mice, electrophysiology, and biochemical assays. Overall, these studies are expected to identify Rit as a crucial signal integration hub in the setting of brain injury ? orchestrating diverse endogenous pathways that regulate neuronal survival, promote neuronal regeneration, and control neuroplasticity mechanisms.',\n",
       " 'Lassa virus (LASV) is a highly prevalent arenavirus in West Africa, where it infects several hundred thousand people annually, resulting in a high number of Lassa fever (LF) cases, a hemorrhagic fever (HF) disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. The impact of LF in human health led to its inclusion on the WHO list of top Priority Diseases in 2017. Moreover, LASV poses a credible threat to biodefense readiness. There are not FDA-licensed LASV vaccines and current anti-arenaviral therapy is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective. Live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) are the most feasible approach to control HF arnaviruses within their endemic regions. The LAV Candid#1 (Can) strain of the arenavirus Junin (JUNV) has been shown to be a safe and effective vaccine to protect humans against Argentine HF caused by JUNV. The central goal of this exploratory R21 grant application is to leverage the established safety record and efficacy in humans of Can, together with our expertise in arenavirus reverse genetics to generate recombinant Can (rCan) expressing LASV antigens (rCan/lasvAg) to test the hypothesis that r3Can/lasvAg represent a novel approach to develop a safe and effective LAV to combat LF. To test our hypothesis we propose to complete the following specific aims (SA): SA 1. Generation and characterization of r3Can expressing LASV antigens (r3Can/lasvAg): We will rescue r3Can/lasvAg expressing NP* or GPC*, or both, LASV antigens known to induce protective immune responses against LASV. NP* contains mutation D478A to prevent its interference with the activity of Can vRNP, whereas GPC* corresponds to a stabilized pre-fusion form that is not incorporated into infectious particles, but predicted to induce a strong neutralizing and protective Ab response against LASV. We will characterize r3Can/lasvAg growth properties in cultured cells and virulence in mice. We will test the hypothesis that r3Can/lasvAg grow to titers compatible for vaccine production but are attenuated in vivo. SA 2. Assess r3Can/lasvAg safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice: We will assess r3Can/lasvAg safety in IFN- a/bg R KO B6 mice, which are highly susceptible to JUNV. We will evaluate immunogenicity of r3Can/lasvAg by examining both T-cell responses and production of virus-specific antibodies in immunized B6 mice. We will determine r3Can/lasvAg protective efficacy by challenging r3Can/lasvAg immunized B6 mice with rVSV expressing LASV NP and GPC antigens. We will test the hypothesis that r3Can/lasvAg are safe and able to induce LASV antigen-specific protective immunity. SA 3. Determine the stability of r3Can/lasvAg in cultured cells and in vivo: We will test the hypothesis that r3Can/lasvAg are phenotypically and genetically stable during multiplication in cultured cells and in vivo.',\n",
       " \"UC Davis Cardiovascular Symposium Systems Approach to Understanding Cardiac Excitation-Contraction and Arrhythmias ? Mechanics and Energetics in Heart diseases and Arrhythmias ABSTRACT Heart diseases remain the leading cause of death, but still without effective drug therapies. In order to develop better and more effective therapies to treat heart diseases, it is critically important for scientists and physicians to obtain in-depth and accurate understanding of the heart disease mechanisms. In recent decades, researchers studying heart diseases in the field have been accumulating more and more experimental data from molecular, to cellular, and to tissue and organ levels. However, important conceptual advances in the cardiac field require integration of the knowledge from multiple scales. Here we propose to take the necessary step forward to integrate experimental data into quantitative models that enable using mathematical tools and computational power to understand the complex interactions of the cells and molecules in the heart. The unique design of this conference series is to combine experimental study and mathematical modeling to achieve in-depth understanding of the dynamic systems that control cardiac function and heart diseases.  The proposed interdisciplinary conference is the 5th in this series entitled ?System's Approach to Understand Cardiac Excitation-Contraction Coupling?. The previous conferences have received overwhelmingly positive evaluations from attendees and resulted in high impact publications. The proposed conference will combine experimental and modeling studies in the field of Mechanics and Energetics, with topics focused on the cutting edge research in cardiac mechanics, mechanotransduction, and feedback between energetics and mechanics in heart diseases and arrhythmias. The emphasis of this conference will be on (1) summarizing current state of research in the focus area, (2) identifying consensus and controversy that warrant more investigation, (3) exchanging ideas, data, and information among the experimentalists and modelers to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations. The conference results will be summarized in the form of comprehensive review papers which will be published in leading scientific journals that have broad impact on the research community.\",\n",
       " \"Summary/Abstract Although influenza vaccination is the best available tool for reducing illnesses and deaths due to influenza, influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary substantially from year to year, depending on the antigenic match between circulating viruses and vaccine strains. To guide the ongoing development of influenza vaccination recommendations, we propose to conduct annual estimates of influenza VE, influenza burden of illness, and cases prevented by vaccination. We will conduct active surveillance for medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza in a predefined cohort. We will identify patients seeking ambulatory care for acute respiratory illness; eligible and consenting patients will be enrolled in the study. We will collect specimens for respiratory virus testing from all participants, which will be tested for influenza (including type, subtype, and lineage) via nucleic acid amplification. We will determine risk factors for influenza, and illness outcomes, through a combination of questionnaires and administrative healthcare databases. We will determine subjects' influenza vaccination history through self-report, validated using an immunization registry. Data will be shared with CDC and other participating sites to provide mid-season and end-of-season VE estimates. We will estimate VE using a test-negative design, comparing the odds of vaccination among subjects who test positive for influenza with the odds among subjects testing negative. We will provide annual estimates stratified by virus type/subtype/lineage and by age group. Because we are identifying patients with influenza from a defined cohort, we will also estimate the incidence of medically attended influenza in our study population, and estimate the number of influenza cases averted by vaccination.  This project will also serve as a resource for studying VE and epidemiology of a novel influenza virus, should an influenza pandemic occur during the study period. We will work with CDC and other sites to prepare and pilot-test protocols for pandemic studies. In addition, this project provides a platform for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) surveillance, which can provide important data on the epidemiology of RSV prior to licensure of RSV vaccines. We will test specimens for RSV and estimate the incidence of medically attended RSV in our study population. Finally, we will use data collected from this study to further explore potential biases and limitations of the test-negative design and to anticipate possible effects of RSV vaccine licensure on influenza VE estimates from test-negative studies.  The proposed research will 1) generate data to guide influenza prevention actions and recommendations; 2) provide baseline data on RSV incidence prior to vaccine licensure; and 3) enhance our understanding of the test-negative study design.\",\n",
       " 'Abstract: The attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) on 9/11/2001 (9/11) involved collision of two aircraft into the buildings and the combustion of many thousands of pounds of jet fuel. The subsequent collapse on the towers, and the rescue/recovery effort that followed, led to large numbers of responders being exposed to a wide variety of hazardous material including pulverized cement, glass, asbestos, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated furans and dioxins (1-3). Three research centers that follow cohorts of rescue and recovery workers since the WTC disaster include the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY); the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS); and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). Modest though mostly non-statistically significantly elevated cancer rates post-exposure to the WTC-site have been reported in all three of the cohorts, despite limited follow-up time since 9/11/2001 (4-7). We propose to combine these three cohorts to account for individuals who are in more than one cohort, to increase the sample size, and to make the results more generalizable. We plan to update the incidence findings from the prior reports using consistent exposure and outcome definitions and taking advantage of the additional six years of follow-up since those publications. We also plan to study the time elapsed from WTC- exposure to increased incidence of WTC-associated cancer. We believe that this short-term high intensity exposure with long-term follow-up in responder cohorts, combined for these analyses, offers a rare opportunity to investigate cancer latency in humans. Finally, we also propose the first study of cancer survival in WTC rescue/recovery workers with cancer.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract  Most prostate cancer deaths are due to failed treatment response or to metastasis, particularly to bone. We have been studying the mechanisms responsible for treatment failure using genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) that recapitulate key features of advanced prostate cancer, including castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and aggressive-variant CRPC with neuroendocrine differentiation (CRPC-NE), and that develop highly penetrant metastatic prostate cancer including to bone, which is the primary site of metastasis in humans. Using novel cross-species computational approaches, we have shown that the mechanisms underlying disease progression in these GEMMs are conserved with human prostate cancer, while drug response in GEMMs can be predictive of drug response in humans. Among our major findings, we have shown that GEMMs based on combined loss-of-function of Pten and p53 (NPp53), which are frequently co-mutated in human CRPC, model key phenotypic and molecular features of treatment-induced aggressive variant CRPC. Not only do these NPp53 mice fail to respond to treatment with anti-androgens, treatment actually accelerates disease progression, which we have called exceptional non-responders. Furthermore, we have shown that the treatment-induced neuroendocrine phenotype (CRPC-NE) of these exceptional non-responders is related to lineage plasticity.  Thus, our proposed studies will test the hypotheses that: (i) co-clinical analyses of GEMMs and human prostate cancer can elucidate biological and molecular mechanisms of drug response, and (ii) lineage plasticity is an important novel mechanism of drug resistance. In Aim 1 we will perform co-clinical investigations capitalizing on our GEMMs that model key aspects of advanced prostate cancer, and complemented with analyses of human prostate cancer organoid models. We will evaluate the efficacy of clinically-relevant drugs and drug combinations, focusing on those that: (a) counteract cellular plasticity associated with treatment resistance in CRPC; and (b) target bone metastasis. In Aim 2, we will investigate molecular mechanisms of drug response leveraging our genome-wide regulatory networks that enable cross-species integration between data from GEMMs and human prostate cancer. We will focus on identifying ?treatment response regulators? that inform on response to: (i) lineage plasticity and/or (ii) bone metastasis. In Aim 3 we will identify novel drivers of advanced prostate cancer using a forward genetic screening approach. Toward this end, we have undertaken a genetic screen utilizing the Sleeping Beauty (SB) murine transposon-based system, and have shown that mice harboring the activated transposon display accelerated lethal prostate cancer phenotypes. Taken together, the successful implementation of these Aims will identify tumor contexts that are responsive to drug treatment and molecular mechanisms of drug response, and will identify new targets for intervention.',\n",
       " 'Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by muscle contractions that cause debilitating twisting movements and postures. DYT1 dystonia, the most common inherited dystonia, is a severe form of generalized dystonia. DYT1 dystonia is caused by a mutation in the TOR1A gene, resulting in a glutamic acid deletion in the TorsinA protein. Despite the identification of a causal mutation, our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to abnormal movements is incomplete. This limited understanding of pathological mechanisms likely explains, in part, why there are few therapeutics available to treat the disorder. The preferred oral therapeutic for dystonia is the non-selective muscarinic antagonist trihexyphenidyl (THP). While THP is an effective treatment for many patients, its utility is limited by dose-limiting side effects. To date, the mechanism of action of THP in DYT1 dystonia is unknown. One clue to THP?s therapeutic mechanism is the fact that dopamine (DA) dysfunction in the basal ganglia has been consistently implicated in many forms of dystonia. Humans with DYT1 have normal striatal tissue DA but have abnormal DA metabolite ratios. Mice harboring the human DYT1-causing mutation also have normal striatal tissue DA, but reduced extracellular DA in the striatum. This evidence suggests that striatal DA release is reduced in DYT1 mice and humans. Importantly, preliminary data collected in our lab shows that THP effectively enhances striatal extracellular DA concentrations. However, the exact muscarinic receptor subtypes responsible for this effect are unknown. This is a critical piece of information for developing new treatments for dystonia, without the adverse side effect profile of THP. The purpose of this proposal is to determine the muscarinic receptor subtype(s) responsible for the DA-enhancing effect of THP and the improvement of motor symptoms in DYT1 dystonia.',\n",
       " \"Project Summary/Abstract The overall objective is to define the molecular mechanisms through which Ca2+ homeostasis is perturbed in different brain diseases and how ion channels contribute to complex Ca2+-signaling intimately linked to neuronal damage and death. Our studies focus on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) that is the primary Ca2+ release channel of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cell's major Ca2+ storage organelle. Gating of IP3R is initiated by IP3 binding but tightly regulated by many additional signals, notably by interactions with pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family members. Strong evidence suggests that de-regulation of IP3R inevitably leads to pathological conditions by ether an exaggerated cell death as in neurodegenerative diseases or escape from cell death as in some types of cancer. Despite recent progress in our understanding of how Bcl-2 proteins regulate the apoptotic switch, the structural basis for Ca2+ signaling disturbance in apoptosis via IP3R channels is largely unknown. There is a pressing need for atomic level structural information on how IP3R interacts with apoptotic proteins to coordinate its gating. To address this challenge, we extend our cryo-EM studies to recombinant full-length tetrameric IP3R1 purified from cultured cells (aim 1). The overarching goal of this aim is to push resolution limits in our cryo-EM studies of IP3R beyond 4.0 Ã… resolution recently achieved by our group for type 1 IP3R (IP3R1), purified from cerebellum. Using recombinant protein technology, we anticipate isolating more homogeneous channel sample than is likely present in native tissues. This will facilitate progress towards atomic-resolution structure determination and will allow to resolve protein regions that are missing in cryo-EM structure of native IP3R1 due to its genuine structural heterogeneity. Our goal is to solve structure of IP3R1 in complex with Bcl-2 protein to unveil the structural basis for the functional interactions of IP3R1 with modulatory apoptotic proteins, and to determine how the interplay between members of the Bcl-2 family sets the apoptotic threshold for cell life-or-death decision (aim 2). Structural studies will be complemented by functional experiments to establish physiological relevance of structural discoveries. The proposed studies are innovative since little is known at the atomic level about regulation of the IP3R channel by its binding partners, including apoptotic proteins. Because IP3R and Bcl-2 proteins are important to cell survival, adaptation and death processes, the proposed studies are significant to both our understanding of normal cellular physiology, and also to diseases associated with disturbed Ca2+ signaling and defective apoptosis, including neurodegeneration and cancer. Overall, this project represents the essential step towards atomistic descriptions of IP3R channel gating that will provide novel structural insights into critical IP3R channel functions and will serve as a platform for the development of future drugs targeting human IP3R.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract: Many flaviviruses such as Dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Yellow Fever virus cause significant human diseases. However, no clinically approved antiviral therapy is available for treatment of flavivirus infections. Therefore, the development of vaccines and antiviral agents for prevention and treatment of flavivirus infections is a clear public health priority. The long- range goal of this proposal is to address this need by developing a new system to identify, screen and validate a class of potential flavivirus inhibitors, and successfully identify and analyze candidate compounds that show promise in disrupting viral survival. During flaviviral infection of the host cell, a single viral polyprotein is synthesized from the viral genome. This polyprotein is cleaved into its component proteins by a combination of host cell proteases and a two-component viral protease, encoded in genes NS2B and NS3. The function of this viral protease is indispensable for virus assembly and replication. The objectives of this project are to develop innovative high throughput screening strategies to identify and characterize compounds that orthosterically inhibit the function of the critical protease NS2B- NS3. To achieve project objectives, in Specific Aim 1, we will develop and perform novel high- throughput screening primary, secondary, and tertiary assays capable of screening large chemical libraries to identify orthosteric inhibitors. In Specific Aim 2, after optimizing these assays, we will perform large-scale HTS to screen a compound library of >400,000 compounds for potential protease inhibitor candidates, employing five levels of screening to fully eliminate false positives. In Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the efficacy of the resulting candidate compounds for their capacity to block protease activity, and determined their modes of actions. Lead compounds against the protease will be tested for cellular toxicity, reduction of flavivirus titer in cell culture, resistant variants, and limited structure-activity relationship. We will ultimately test the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in live animals for the most potent compounds. We anticipate the outcome of this study will be the generation of crucial new information on flavivirus inhibitor-enzyme interaction at structurally significant sites. This creates the potential for identifying novel classes of flaviviral inhibitors, suitable for addressing the global public health need for new antiviral agents to fight flaviviruses.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Each year, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections contribute to over 8 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) and nearly 2 million deaths. Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a first-line sterilizing anti-tubercular drug that is anticipated to be an irreplaceable component of future TB treatment regimens. Despite more than 60 years of clinical use of PZA, the mechanistic basis for its activity has yet to be resolved. Previous studie have demonstrated that PZA is a pro-drug that is converted to the active form of pyrazinoic acid (POA) by the M. tuberculosis amidase PncA, and that loss of function mutations in pncA account for the vast majority of PZA resistance. In addition, while PZA is only conditionally bacteriostatic for M. tuberculosis in laboratory culture, this drug mediates sterilization of bacili in humans and in animal models of infection. Thus, there is an as yet undefined host-dependent activity involved in potentiation of PZA action on M. tuberculosis. Our long-term goal for this project is to define the mechanistic basis for PZA action against M. tuberculosis. It is known that POA, but not PZA, forms complexes with several divalent metals involved in biocatalysis and oxidative stress, yet the relevance of this interaction for PZA action has not been explored. We are using a multidisciplinary approach to address the hypothesis that PZA treatment has a profound impact on metal homeostasis and oxidative stress in M. tuberculosis. These studies will shed new light on the poorly understood mode of action of PZA and stand to explain the dichotomous outcome of M. tuberculosis PZA exposure in culture versus in a mammalian system. Resolving the basis for PZA action will guide the discovery of novel agents with a conserved or improved action against M. tuberculosis to counter drug resistance.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract - Core and Additional Components Influenza, an important cause of morbidity and mortality, and influenza vaccination are key components of influenza prevention. The effectiveness of influenza vaccine varies from year to year, and it can vary by virus subtype, age group, product type, population characteristics, and antigenic match. Annual assessment of clinical vaccine effectiveness is therefore needed to evaluate the impact of current vaccine recommendations and policies, understand the relationship between antigenic changes in viruses and clinical protection, and prepare for vaccine assessment during a pandemic. Interim, mid-season estimates of vaccine effectiveness are useful for public health agencies and physicians. The first Aim of the project is to estimate the effectiveness of influenza vaccine for preventing medically-attended, laboratory confirmed influenza illness in a defined population cohort of adults and children. Patients who seek outpatient care for acute respiratory illness will be recruited during the influenza season. Patients with cough and illness duration ?7 days will be eligible. After informed consent, nose and throat swabs will be tested for influenza A and B using a nucleic acid amplification test (RT- PCR). Samples will be provided to CDC for antigenic characterization and other tests as appropriate. Influenza immunization status will be determined by a validated immunization registry. Vaccine effectiveness will be calculated using the test negative design where cases include participants with RT-PCR confirmed influenza and controls include study participants with noninfluenza respiratory illness (negative RT-PCR). Data will be provided to CDC for combined analyses with other participating sites, including mid-season data for interim analysis of effectiveness. When possible, separate estimates of vaccine effectiveness will be calculated for different age groups, influenza subtypes, and for different vaccine products. The second Aim is to evaluate the disease burden due to RSV during the last three seasons of the project. Participant samples will be tested for RSV using RT-PCR, and the incidence of medically attended RSV will be estimated. The third Aim is to serve as an emergency response resource for CDC pandemic studies of vaccination and antivirals. This will include pilot studies to prepare for a pandemic.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to establish a Fundamental-Plus occupational health and safety surveillance program for the State of Nebraska, within the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (NDHHS), the state agency which has general supervision, control, and primary responsibility over matters relating to public health (Neb. Rev. Stat. Â§81-601). This research will use existing available data and wil identify new data sources in order to collect, analyze, and interpret surveillance data, putting a special emphasis on underserved, high risk groups such as minorities, young workers, older workers, and workers in high risk industries and occupations. We will collect all 21 occupational health indicators which have been identified by the NIOSH-States Occupational Health Surveillance Work Group. These indicators are specific measures of health or risk status (i.e. the occurrence of a health event or of factors associated with that event) among specific working populations. To further enhance surveillance for reportable conditions associated with workplace exposures, we will implement a surveillance system incorporating investigation and analysis of occupational poisoning or illness due to exposures to pesticides, lead, and other chemicals prioritized by our stakeholders. We will generate and communicate information with our partners to guide interventions and develop recommendations for prevention through making referrals, disseminating data and findings, and conducting educational outreach. In addition to surveillance activities, our program will maintain existing relationships and build new collaborations with local, state, and national stakeholders to further integrate occupational health into mainstream public health. An Advisory Committee consisting of state leaders in occupational health and safety will be convened to prioritize program activities and provide input on emerging issues in Nebraska.',\n",
       " 'Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and among Veterans in the United States, the third despite the successful implementation of successful preventive screening measures. One contributing factor that has newly emerged is the rapid development of cancers in small, sessile adenomas (polyps), with mutational processes and signatures that drive early CRC tumorigenesis. Yet, to date, biomarkers and risk factors for polyps (adenomas) that inordinately and rapidly develop into colon cancer remain poorly defined. We recently observed surprisingly high mutational profiles through whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis in 2 of 4 pairs of benign colorectal adenoma tissue samples. Extending this to unsupervised hierarchical clustered transcriptomic analysis of a further 7 pairs of adenomas reveals distinct mutational signatures regardless of adenoma size. Strikingly, we observe mutations in the TGF-? pathway and CEA-associated genes in 4 out of 11 adenomas, overlapping with the Wnt pathway. Immunohistochemical labeling reveals a nearly 5-fold increase in CEA levels in 23% of adenoma samples tested, with a concomitant loss of TGF-? signaling. We have defined a functional role by which the CEA B3 domain interacts with TGFBR1, potentially inactivating the tumor suppressor function of TGF-? signaling. Raised CEA levels occur with concomitant loss of TGF-? signaling and activation of oncogenic molecules that include STAT3. Furthermore, deletion of Smad3/4 adaptor ?2SP results in loss of TGF-? signaling, with a spontaneous formation of adenomas as well as overt CRC, and presents a strong mouse model of CRC. The overall hypothesis of this application is that disruption of the TGF-? tumor suppressor pathway, and concomitantly raised levels of oncogenic molecules such as CEA, STAT3, disrupt normal colonic mucosa and promote oncogenesis in CRC. Our aims are to: AIM 1a) Expand and validate the significance of loss of the TGF-? pathway associated with high CEA and/or CEACAM6 levels as prognostic factors in advanced adenomas that rapidly progress to CRC through i) First, whole transcriptomic sequence, immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analyses of 40 additional adenomas ii) Secondly, by examining The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan gastrointestinal cancer (GI) datasets to obtain a complete evaluation of our findings. 1b) Determine whether CEA/CEACAM6 and STAT3 with loss of TGF-? signaling are drivers of early CRC in vivo. 2 a) Determine the molecular mechanisms by which CEA inhibits the TGF-? tumor suppressor pathway in early and advanced CRC. We plan to accomplish this through i) Analyzing the role of CEA and CEACAM6 in the disruption of the TGF-? pathway and concomitant IL-6/STAT3 activation in CRC. ii) Determine antitumor activity of CEA inhibition, with and without STAT3 inhibitors and characterize their mechanisms of action. Through translational studies- interrogating human cell lines/genomics, and animal model systems of colon cancer, this application proposes an integrated approach for human CRC, providing novel insights into early and advanced CRC. With vaccines available, as well as new low toxicity therapeutics, identifying specific populations particularly among Veterans with multiple co-morbidities, that could respond to treatment, these goals are centrally important for improving the quality of life under treatment, as well as the mortality from this common cancer.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          A major cause of colon removal surgery in veterans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a failure of medically-induced mucosal healing. Mucosal healing is a reliable clinical marker of recovery after IBD therapy as it is associated with durable clinical remission. Despite the importance of mucosal repair, we continue to have a poor understanding of many of the cellular and molecular elements that mediate ulcer healing. The current proposal focuses on the role of colonic (epithelial) stem cells (CSC) in ulcer healing during colitis. Wnt/?-catenin signaling in stem cells promotes cell proliferation as well as self-renewal, both essential functions needed for ulcer healing and restitution of the mucosal barrier. A central tenant of this proposal is the hypothesis that Wnt/?-catenin signaling plays an integral role in mucosal repair in IBD and that steroids delay ulcer healing my impairing Wnt/?-catenin signaling. In mucosal ulceration, as seen in IBD, there is replacement of surface mucosa with granulation tissue that is re-epithelialized with new crypt structures. We suspect that active Wnt signaling is required for several steps through this sequence of events from stage 1) generation of an intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) monolayer, to stage 2) formation of epithelial invaginations, to stage 3) formation of crypt islands on ulcer surfaces and finally stage 4) regeneration of mature crypts (Fig 3). Biochemical data from our lab indicate Wnt/?-catenin signaling is increased during ulcer healing in colitis in mice and IBD patients. In studies to interrogate the role of Wnt signaling in ulcer healing, we discovered that IEC expressing mRNA for the Wnt target gene Axin2 expand in ulcer margins, on ulcer surfaces, and within newly-formed crypt structures in the middle of ulcers. Studies using a novel Axin2 reporter mouse model indicate that Axin2+ IEC are pluripotent and capable of growing colonoid structures in vitro from a single cell. Together the preliminary data suggest that Axin2+ IEC represent a novel ISC population that forms new crypt structures during ulcer healing. In Aim 1, Axin2lacZ/+ and Axin2 CreERT2/+; R26RmTmG/+ mice will be used to study ulcer-associated Axin2+ IEC localization and gene expression profiles of this new stem cell population, as well as perform lineage tracing during ulcer healing in DSS colitis. In Aim 2 we will examine ulcer healing in mice treated with steroids. New studies will utilize Axin2-specific expression of stabilized ?-catenin to examine its role in ulcer healin during steroid therapy. Aim 3 studies will interrogate the role of Axin2+ IEC in human IBD and will analyze the mechanisms by which steroids impair ulcer healing. The goal of these studies will be to determine if untreated UC patients exhibit increased Axin2 expression, Wnt signaling and stem cell gene expression in areas of ulcer healing (Aim 3A) and determine whether steroid therapy reduces levels of Axin2 expression and stem cell activation in areas of delayed ulcer healing in a prospective trial of UC patients treated with steroids for a colitis flare (Aim 3B). Together the studies proposed will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern ulcer healing in colitis. The goal is to determine areas where therapeutic targets can be designed to safely accelerate ulcer healing and reverse the negative impact of steroids on mucosal repair in colitis.',\n",
       " 'Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and a significant burden for Veterans and the VHA due to the high frequency of recurrence and progression linked to smoking and exposure to deployment- related carcinogens. Nearly 80% of bladder cancers do not invade the muscle of the bladder wall (called ?non- muscle invasive bladder cancer?, NMIBC) but the most aggressive of these tumors will progress to muscle invasion with lymph node metastasis resulting in death in 30% of patients. The primary cause of death from bladder cancer is resistance to therapy as these invasive carcinomas acquire cellular plasticity and stem cell- like properties. Identification of mechanisms that regulate this change in cellular differentiation This invasive phenotype is a hallmark of cancer and a major shift in differentiation regulated by both genetic mutations and epigenetic cellular reprogramming. The long-term goal of our research is to investigate the molecular and epigenetic pathways driving invasion of bladder cancer. By understanding these mechanisms, we may develop rational and novel therapeutics for patients with bladder cancer. To investigate the epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to invasion and proliferation as a feasible target for bladder cancer, we evaluated the histone methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste-2 (EZH2), as part of the polycomb repressor complex-2 (PRC-2) in bladder cancer. Our preliminary data demonstrate increased expression of EZH2 and its histone target, H3K27me3, in a carcinogen-induced mouse model of bladder cancer. In multiple bladder cancer cell lines, EZH2 expression is increased compared to non-transformed urothelial cells. Destabilization of the PRC-2 complex stops cellular proliferation. Consistent with our findings, bioinformatics analysis of multiple human bladder cancer databases demonstrate that EZH2 is overexpressed in invasive bladder cancers, which we have confirmed in tumor specimens from patients with all stages of bladder cancer. Given this preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that EZH2 drives invasion of bladder cancer by causing global changes in histone methylation that shifts cellular identity to an invasive and stem cell-like phenotype via an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Thus, given our promising preliminary data, we propose to investigate our hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the role of EZH2 in bladder cancer initiation and progression; 2) Investigate aberrant histone methylation of EMT, invasive and stem cell genes by EZH2 in bladder cancer; 3) Evaluate pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 as a treatment for bladder cancer. Currently, we have no personalized genetic or epigenetic targets for bladder cancer and our best therapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is > 40 years old. Through multi-disciplinary collaboration we have demonstrated feasibility with our approach. Successful completion of the studies described in this proposal will provide an innovative approach to both investigate the mechanisms involved in the invasion of bladder cancer and utilize a novel therapeutic approach to treat bladder cancer. These EZH2-targeted agents overcome the challenge of cellular resistance and have pre-clinical investigations that will allow access to Veterans with bladder cancer.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are associated with premature development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mortality rates among US Veterans with RA are more than twice that of age-matched men in the general population, a risk that appears to be higher than that observed in other RA cohorts. Despite strong evidence that chronic inflammation accelerates CVD, currently available treatments are not sufficient to prevent the accelerated CVD. Therefore, other approaches that target the vascular effectors of chronic inflammation are needed. The long-term goal of our research program is to understand the mechanisms by which the Nox1 NADPH oxidase contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular disease and identify novel therapeutic targets to reduce CVD. In work that was funded by a VA Merit Award, we have identified mechanisms of cytokine-mediated Nox1 activation. Our findings have also established a link between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and Nox1 in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth and migration. In this renewal application, our objective is to integrate these findings and explore the mechanism by which chronic inflammation increases CVD. We hypothesize that chronic inflammation increases circulating EGF-like ligands, which induces vascular Nox1 expression and primes SMCs to cytokine activation, thereby promoting vascular disease. We will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the mechanism by which EGF-like ligands accelerate vascular injury via Nox1 activation. Proposed studies will be performed in cultured human vascular SMCs and assess (1) the role of Nox1 splice isoforms; (2) ROS-induced ROS mechanisms, and (3) priming effects of EGF-like ligands on SMCs? Aim 2: Determine whether interrupting EGFR-Nox1 activation in SMCs prevents accelerated development of vascular disease in chronic inflammation. Proposed studies will induce neointimal hyperplasia in genetically modified mice subjected to a model of inflammatory arthritis and examine the effects of (1) smooth muscle cell-specific deficiency of EGFR; (2) deficiency of Nox1; and (3) the inhibition of Nox1 phosphorylation, on neointimal formation. Aim 3: Determine if plasma EGF-like ligands identify RA patients at high risk for developing vascular disease. Proposed studies will utilize the Veterans Affairs Rheumatoid Arthritis (VARA) registry consisting of bio-specimens and longitudinal clinical data to investigate the association of plasma EGF-like ligands in RA patients with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Successful completion of these studies will provide new insights into the mechanisms by which chronic inflammation, such as RA, increases morbidity and mortality of CVD. A positive clinical impact of our proposed studies is that our findings will provide new strategies fr the development of specific targeted therapeutics for the treatment of Veterans with chronic inflammation and vascular disease.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus are the major risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma, a deadly cancer whose incidence has increased more than 7-fold over the past three decades. For reasons that remain unclear, metaplastic Barrett's cells are predisposed to cancer progression. Although the precise molecular events underlying this malignant transformation are not known, chronic GERD appears to underlie the process, perhaps because GERD causes inflammation with oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage in Barrett's epithelial cells. The modern medical therapy of GERD is directed almost exclusively at decreasing gastric acid production with medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Although the PPIs have been extremely effective for healing reflux esophagitis, these medications do not correct the underlying reflux diathesis, nor do they prevent bile reflux-induced oxidative DNA injury. This might explain why the frequency of esophageal adenocarci-noma continues to rise despite the widespread use of PPIs. Clearly, new medical treatments are needed to prevent bile reflux-induced oxidative stress and the malignant progression of Barrett's metaplasia.  Recent data suggest that esophageal adenocarcinomas develop as a consequence of GERD-induced oxidative genomic damage. Left unrepaired, oxidative DNA damage accumulates with subsequent cell cycles, leading to the genomic instability that is a strong predictor for cancer progression in Barrett's metaplasia. Maintenance of genomic integrity requires an appropriate cellular response to oxidative genomic injury, which is a key function of the p53 gene that is inactivated frequently during carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus. Oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage activate Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM), a protein that transmits oxidative damage signals to p53 and p38 effector proteins. Data suggest that, in p53-deficient cells, ATM-induced activation of p38 is essential to cause G1 arrest, a process that prevents cells with damaged DNA from undergoing mitoses that would perpetuate oxidative DNA errors. Thus, agents that enhance this p38-dependent G1 checkpoint response might be used for chemoprevention in Barrett's esophagus.  In both p53-intact and p53-deficent Barrett's cells, our preliminary data demonstrate that weakly acidic bile salts induce oxidative DNA damage, cause G1 arrest, and rapidly increase levels of APE-1 and XRCC1 (base excision repair [BER] proteins that correct oxidative damage). Weakly acidic bile salts increase phospho- p38 expression, which appears to be especially important for maintaining genomic integrity in Barrett's metaplasia, as evidenced by our finding that p38 inhibition abolishes the G1 arrest induced by weakly acidic bile salts. In addition, our preliminary data show that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, a non-genotoxic, hydrophilic bile acid) hastens DNA repair in these cells. Those findings suggest a potential chemopreventive role for UDCA in patients with Barrett's esophagus. We hypothesize that, in metaplastic Barrett's epithelial cells, reflux-induced oxidative stress activates the p38 stress pathway to induce G1 arrest and enable repair of oxidative DNA damage, and that treatment with UDCA can enhance these response and repair processes. The aims of this study are: 1) To elucidate the mechanisms whereby oxidative stress caused by acid and bile salts activates p38 to regulate proteins that control the G1-S cell cycle checkpoint in Barrett's epithelial cells, and to determine if UDCA enhances these responses, 2) To elucidate the role of p38 in activating DNA BER proteins to repair acidic bile salt-induced oxidative DNA damage, and if UDCA enhances the efficiency of oxidative DNA damage repair in Barrett's epithelial cells, and 3) To determine the effects of bile acid-induced oxidative stres on phosphorylating p38 and other key proteins regulating the G1-S cell cycle checkpoint, and to determine if oral UDCA treatment enhances the expression of key BER proteins in biopsy specimens of Barrett's metaplasia already collected from patients who completed our previously funded CSR&D Merit Review study.\",\n",
       " \"Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Project Summary/Abstract Defective regulation of early intestinal mucosal restitution underlies various critical pathological states such as acute mucosal injury/hemorrhage, impaired repair of erosions/ulcers, disruption of epithelial integrity, and epithelial barrier dysfunction. Since the exact mechanisms of early rapid mucosal restitution after superficial wounds are still obscure, effective therapies to preserve gut epithelial integrity in clinic are limited, especially in patiets with critical surgical illnesses such as trauma and sepsis. The restoration of normal intestinal mucosal integrity after injury and/or ulceration requires epithelial cell decisions that regulate signaling networks controlling expression of various genes. Posttranscriptional events, particularly altered mRNA turnover and translation, are major mechanisms by which mammalian cells control gene expression in response to various stresses. Changes in mRNA stability and translation are predominantly governed by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) that are emerged as master regulators of maintenance of gut epithelial integrity. However, little is known about the roles of RBPs and miRNAs in the mechanisms underlying rapid mucosal restitution after acute injury. HuR is among the most prominent translation and turnover regulatory RBPs and is recently show to regulate cell motility. Our preliminary results indicate that a) HuR silencing represses intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) migration over the wounded area in an in vitro model; b) tissue specific HuR knockout inhibits early intestinal mucosal repair after injury; and c) miR-195 overexpression represses early epithelial repair in vitro, but this repression is rescued by increasing HuR levels. Based on these exciting observations, we HYPOTHESIZE that HuR is essential for intestinal epithelial restitution after injury by altering the stability and translation of target mRNAs encoding cell migration-regulatory proteins and its effect is regulated by given miRNAs. Three specific aims are proposed to test the hypothesis. 1) To determine the exact role of HuR in early intestinal mucosal restitution after acute injury. 2) To define new target mRNAs of HuR and its role in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation in the intestinal epithelium after wounding. 3) To investigate the interactions between HuR and given miRNAs in the control of stability and translation of target mRNAs in response to epithelial injury. Completion of these specific aims will make a significant conceptual advance by linking HuR/miRNA-mediated posttranscriptional gene regulation with early mucosal restitution in the intestine and will create a fundamental base for development of new therapeutic approaches for gut mucosal injury-related diseases and for maintaining epithelial integrity under various clinical conditions.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         70 million Americans suffer from some sort of sleep disorder. Behavior, mood and memory deteriorate with sleep loss and it gets worse with continuing sleep deprivation. There is considerable amount of data on arousal neurons whereas very little is known about the neurons that make us fall asleep. Indeed, current network models of sleep-wake regulation list many arousal neuronal populations compared to only one sleep group located in the preoptic area. Better hypnotics will emerge if there was direct evidence linking specific phenotypes of neurons to sleep. To provide this evidence, we will use optogenetics to selectively manipulate sleep- active neurons. One group of sleep-active neurons is located in the preoptic area and contains galanin. Using galanin-Cre mice, the gene for the light-sensitive excitatory opsin, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), or the inhibitory opsin, enhanced Archaerhodopsin (eArch3.0), will be inserted into the galanin neurons and effects on sleep measured. Galanin neurons in the preoptic area will be optogenetically stimulated or inhibited during the night or day and under conditions that alter the animal's internal drive to stay awake (24h fasting) or sleep (6h sleep deprivation). In the same mouse, the second group of sleep-active neurons located in the lateral hypothalamus that contain melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) will be stimulated/inhibited with light. Recently, we published data indicating that stimulation of the MCH neurons robustly increases both non-REM and REM sleep. Now that there are two sleep- active neuronal groups it is necessary to simultaneously activate/inhibit both groups, or activate one while inhibiting th other to determine potency of each to sleep. To demonstrate that the stimulated neurons release the peptide an ELISA assay will be used to detect galanin and MCH in the CSF after 6h of optogenetic stimulation. Separate electrophysiology studies will directly monitor neuronal activity in the brain and determine the pattern of activity as the sleep-inducing signal propagates across the network. Does stimulation of the preoptic sleep-active neurons activate the distally located MCH sleep-active neurons? Do neurons adjacent to the stimulation site respond earlier or at the same time as distal arousal neurons? What is the temporal response of specific sleep versus wake neurons to the stimulation and to the emergence of sleep? Such brain activity maps are essential to identify functional connectivity and are consistent with the Brain Activity Map Project. From a translational perspective these studies are potentially useful in sleep disorders, such as insomnia, where sleep needs to be triggered against a strong arousal drive. These aims will provide a framework for integrating the sleep-active neurons within an overall model of sleep- wake regulation.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) develop as a consequence to abnormal remodeling of the aortic extracellular matrix (ECM). TAA development is influenced by a series of interrelated mechanisms that disrupt ECM homeostasis through the stimulation of proteolytic pathways, such as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and dysregulation of the production and deposition of ECM proteins. Importantly, these mechanisms are mediated in part through changes in the resident cellular constituents within the aortic wall. Numerous studies have demonstrated that aortic dilatation is accompanied by the apoptotic loss of smooth muscle cells, suggesting that the aortic fibroblast may be the key cellular mediator of ECM remodeling during aneurysm formation. Moreover, recent evidence from this laboratory suggests that aortic fibroblasts undergo a stable transformation to a myofibroblast phenotype, that is characterized by increased myosin staining (DDR2/Myh11) and enhanced production of both MMPs and ECM proteins. It is hypothesized that the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts is essential for TAA progression. However, the mediator(s) regulating this fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition during TAA development remain undefined. One upstream signaling protein capable of regulating the structure and composition of the aortic ECM, and known to play an important role in mediating the fibroblast-to- myofibroblast transformation, is transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?). TGF-? is a soluble peptide growth factor, produced by multiple cell types within the aortic wall, and is known to play a significant role in aortic root dilatation secondary to Marfan syndrome, but its involvement remains undefined in non-MFS etiologies of TAA. TGF-? is sequestered within the ECM, bound by latent TGF-? binding proteins. These latent complexes are proteolytic targets for key MMPs (MT1-MMP) that are induced during TAA development. Accordingly, using an established mouse model of TAA, and isolated primary aortic fibroblast cultures (normal and TAA), the role of fibroblast transdifferentiation in TAA development will be examined with the central hypothesis that MT1-MMP- dependent TGF-? signaling is essential for TAA development through the modulation of aortic fibroblast phenotype change. This hypothesis will be tested by demonstrating that selective targeting of fibroblast transdifferentiation can modulate TAA formation and progression, that increased TGF-? signaling during TAA development is a direct result of altered MT1-MMP-dependent release of TGF-? from latent ECM bound stores, and that indirect pharmacological inhibition of TGF-? signaling results in the attenuation of TAA development. The outcomes from this unified set of aims will establish a cause-effect relationship between MT1-MMP activation, TGF-? dependent myofibroblast differentiation, and TAA development.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The overall goal of this proposal is to significantly expand on findings from our ongoing Merit award-supported work to further interrogate gastrointestinal tract colonization and disease establishment of the diarrheagenic pathogen Clostridium difficile. To enable this project, we have identified unique bacterial factors that mediate C. difficile interaction(s) with the host intestine. Three Specific Aims are proposed. First, we will expand on our studies defining C. difficile response to, and tolerance of, reactive oxygen species and redox stress. This response severely impacts GI tract colonization of the pathogen, and highly attenuated, potential vaccine strains were generated for these studies during the current award period. Second, we will continue studies to interrogate infectious mechanism(s) of the low-toxin/high-virulence C. difficile strains we recovered from our active disease surveillance of the Southern Arizona veteran and non-veteran population. The wealth of proteomic data we have garnered will be exploited for genetic studies to define virulence and colonization mechanisms of these strains. Third, and with the goal of translating our research into an immediately clinically-relevant context, we will validate and test our newly-engineered recombinant probiotic bacterium which is a targeted C. difficile colonization inhibitor. All studies in this proposal will use existing or t-be-collected specimens from the veteran population, and utilize both hamster and mouse models of acute C. difficile infection and colonization respectively. We will also incorporate state-of-the-at methodologies including next-generation omics and sequencing, and live-animal bioluminescence imaging to interrogate various aspects of C. difficile colonization and disease establishment.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Stroke represents a major cause of death and disability in our elderly veterans. Stroke is also a major risk factor for cognitive decline, most often due to vascular cognitive impairment. Veterans with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to large-artery disease are at highest risk for early recurrence and are, therefore, most often subjected to aggressive interventions. Furthermore, large- artery disease has been recognized as an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment. The ability to predict recurrence and prognosis following stroke is crucial for developing novel prevention and treatment strategies. Current diagnostic criteria for stroke include clinical and imaging data. However, no biomarker is currently available that can reliably predict recurrence and prognosis. Lack of such knowledge limits our ability to prevent future ischemic strokes or cognitive decline.  Coated-platelets are a subset of procoagulant platelets observed after co-activation with collagen and thrombin. Coated-platelet levels are significantly higher in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA compared to unaffected controls. In addition, higher levels, measured after the initial infarct correlate with an increased risk for recurrent stroke. Among stroke patients, those with stroke due to large-artery disease and elevated coated-platelet levels have a rate of early recurrent stroke 6-7 fold higher than those with lower coated-platelet levels. Research efforts focusing on platelet biology have shown that platelet micro-RNA (miRNA) has considerable potential for deciphering mechanisms underlying differences in platelet reactivity through modulation of gene expression and protein translation. In preliminary studies, we have shown increased coated-platelet production in patients with stroke due to large-artery disease compared to patients with stroke due to cardiac causes and we have found that differences in the expression of platelet miRNA species may be linked to coated- platelet production. These findings raise the possibility that coated-platelets will serve as an additional risk stratification tool in stroke, through mechanisms that involve platelet miRNA  expression.  The research hypotheses for the current grant are: 1) Coated-platelet levels in patients with stroke/TIA due to large-artery disease are markers for prognosis and recurrence risk: higher levels indicate increased likelihood of recurrent ischemic stroke while lower levels indicate an increased likelihood of hemorrhagic complications, 2) Elevated coated-platelet levels predict the presence and progression of cognitive impairment in patients with stroke/TIA due to large-artery disease, and 3) Increased coated-platelet production is mediated through individual micro-RNAs in stroke patients.  The objective of the current application is to determine the relationship of coated-platelets to stroke due to large-artery disease. Three specific aims will test these hypotheses: 1) Determine the relationship between coated-platelets levels and prognosis in patients with stroke/TIA due to large- artery disease, 2) Test the hypothesis that elevated coated-platelets are predictive of cognitive impairment in stroke/TIA due to large-artery disease, and 3) Identify micro-RNA (miRNA) species associated with coated-platelet production. We plan to test our hypotheses in a large group of patients with stroke/TIA due to large-artery disease (N=430).  The rationale for the proposed research is that once we understand the relationship between coated-platelets and cerebrovascular disease we will be able to improve health care delivery for our veterans with stroke through individualized risk assessment strategies and to identify potential targets for novel pharmacological interventions that involve miRNA-mediated platelet reactivity.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Head trauma is a risk factor for both Alzheimer disease (AD) and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that occurs as a consequence of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). CTE causes personality and behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, and memory loss and is characterized by the accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein in the brain. We have shown that CTE can develop following a single explosive blast injury. Thus, veterans are at particular risk for developing CTE as well as AD. Presently, CTE can only be diagnosed at autopsy and there are no known clinical biomarkers. We propose a translational approach to systematically address neurodegeneration in the largest neuropathologically-confirmed autopsy cohort of CTE and CTE with AD (CTE-AD) patients in the world on the protein, DNA, and RNA levels, with the goal of identifying biomarkers, genetic risk factors, and mechanisms that can be targeted for drug discovery. We hypothesize that head trauma leads to the pathologies of AD and CTE through independent mechanisms involving different tau haplotypes and isoforms. Because head trauma and the resulting early pathology of CTE can affect different regions of the brain, we will correlate histological, biochemical, and genetic measures with a tissue microarray demonstrating affected and non-affected regions in human brain. We will use plate-based ELISA to quantitate levels of A? (1-40, 1-42, oligomeric) and tau (total and phosphorylated). In addition, we will determine the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes and tau haplotypes of our subjects and correlate with clinical and pathological measures. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the APOE ?4 allele and H1 tau haplotype are enriched in subjects with CTE and suggests that tau isoform expression differs between CTE and AD. Thus, genomic variation in APOE and MAPT may predict risk for developing trauma-induced neurodegenerations. Furthermore, we will recruit 105 subjects with AD and with and without a history of mTBI as well as controls to measure tau and A? biomarkers in the CSF. We expect that trauma will exacerbate the changes seen in AD, leading to greater tau and less A?. Our preliminary data shows that tau and A? levels in CSF can be used to discriminate subjects with CTE and A? plaques from subjects with AD or FTLD.  Overall, we propose a two-pronged approach of 1) uncovering the progression of AD pathologies in subjects with repetitive mTBI and the mechanisms involved in CTE and AD tauopathy and 2) discovering genetic risk factors and biomarkers based on these pathologies in living subjects. A basic understanding of the mechanisms underlying the neuropathology of mTBI will facilitate rational drug design; and the development of reliable biomarkers to detect the long-term effects of mTBI will enable the diagnosis and monitoring of CTE and CTE-AD during life and will be crucial for assessing the efficacy of potential therapies as they are developed.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a major public health challenge and a growing problem for the Veteran's Affairs (VA) Health System and the Department of Defense (DoD)[1]. While effective treatments for PTSD such as Prolonged Exposure (PE) have been developed [4], a significant number of patients remain symptomatic or are unable to utilize these treatments to their full potential [4, 5]. Thus, optimization of these treatments is essential. Optimizing PE is ot simple, and isolating specific components and then empirically testing them requires multiple studies, large numbers of subjects and thus, is prohibitively expensive. Alternatively, integrating affective neuroscience methods, such as identifying specific potential biomarkers of treatment change can make each study more informative, effective, and less expensive. Neurobiological studies of PTSD have linked specific candidate biomarkers [endogenous glucocorticoids and neurosteroids, i.e. cortisol, allopregnanolone (ALLO) and metabolites, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA/DHEAS)] to PTSD severity and potentially to treatment response. Identifying the mechanisms involved in treatment response can assist in improving therapeutic techniques by targeting specific neurobiological processes involved. Identifying the mechanisms involved in treatment response can assist in improving therapeutic techniques by targeting specific neurobiological processes involved. For instance, identified biomarkers may be used to guide augmentation prior to PE or may lead to directing certain patients to alternate PTSD treatment To this end, we propose an add-on study for an ongoing STRONG STAR affiliated PTSD treatment trial comparing Prolonged Exposure-Web (PE-Web) and Present Centered Therapy (PCT). In our add-on study, we will examine the role of specific candidate biomarkers (endogenous glucocorticoids and neurosteroids, i.e. cortisol awakening response, cortisol response to specific challenge, ALLO and metabolites, and DHEA/DHEAS) collected at Baseline, week 4, Week 8 (post), and one month follow-up as: a) predictors of treatment response, and b) indices of therapeutic change during PTSD treatment. We aim to: 1) identify specific changes in neuroendocrine and neurosteroid patterns that track PTSD symptom changes following effective treatment, 2) examine the specificity of PE-induced neuroendocrine and neurosteroid changes by directly comparing patterns across PE-Web and PCT, and 3) examine whether treatment response related changes in these peripheral biomarkers are directly associated with treatment changes. We expect that increased cortisol responsivity and increases in neurosteroid levels between Baseline and week 8 will be associated with PTSD symptom reduction. Establishing the link between treatment responses and specific biomarkers will allow: mechanism-informed selection of effective treatment (optimizing PE effectiveness), more feasible and effective treatment response studies (increasing efficiency), as well as better individualized treatment tailoring (personalized medicine).\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         A tumor depends upon many cellular processes for growth and survival. Angiogenesis, for example, allows the tumor to create its own vascular supply and thus promotes growth, survival, and metastases. Cell proliferation, on the other hand, leads to sustained cell division and tumor growth. The molecular pathways leading to these processes are multiple, complex, and often redundant. Thus, therapies which have the potential to target different pathways would provide an effective strategy for treatment. RNA stability/translational efficiency is one level of gene regulation which interfaces with many of these pathways. Genes critical for malignant glioma (MG) progression, including growth, angiogenic and anti-apoptotic factors, are regulated at the RNA level by a common motif, the AU-rich element (ARE), present in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). Stressors such as hypoxia, inflammation and tumor therapy are often overcome by upregulation of these genes through RNA stabilization and enhanced translational efficiency. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)- 8, Bcl-2 and other inhibitors of apoptosis (cIAP1 and 2), all of which drive tumor progression in MG are extensively regulated at these levels. ARE-directed post-transcriptional regulation is tightly governed by RNA binding proteins (RBP) that bind to these cis elements. Certain RBPs such as tristetraprolin (TTP) and KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) bind to the ARE and negatively regulate the mRNA target by accelerating degradation and/or silencing translation. HuR, on the other hand, binds to the same elements but promotes mRNA stabilization and enhanced translation. Since our initial observation of HuR overexpression in MG, there have been multiple reports linking HuR to high grade malignancy and poor prognosis in all of the major solid tumors (e.g. breast, lung, prostate, and colon cancer). In the previous funding cycle, we have demonstrated that HuR is required for malignant glioma growth in vivo. This background provides the rationale for the current proposal which is to investigate the anti-cancer properties of a small molecule inhibitor of HuR (MS444) in malignant glioma. We have exciting in vivo preliminary data showing an anti-cancer effect and no significant toxicity. We also have data indicating that brain tumor initiating cells, normally resistant to standard therapy, are particularly sensitive to the inhibitor. We have found that HuR inhibition may target a critical survival pathway driven by NF-kB. Our hypothesis is that MS444 inhibits glioma growth by disrupting the posttranscriptional regulation of key tumor survival pathways provided by HuR. The specific aims will use authentic primary glioma xenolines and mouse models to further characterize this nascent class (i.e. post- transcriptional regulation) of anti-cancer targets. The common occurrence of ARE-governed RNA regulation of growth and anti-apoptotic factors across many tumors broadens the relevance of this proposal MG. Specific Aims:  1. To characterize the antitumor phenotype of the HuR inhibitor, MS-444, in malignant glioma.  2. To characterize the molecular impact of HuR inhibition on the NF-kB survival pathway in malignant  glioma as a mechanism for the anticancer effects of MS444.  3. To assess the specificity of MS444 and other HuR inhibitors for binding to HuR and blocking mRNA binding.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Our armed forces are routinely exposed to hazardous weapons, pathogens, environmental toxins and, later, medical countermeasures with long-term health effects. The kidney is affected by many toxins metabolized in the body that it excretes, including products of rhabdomyolysis (skeletal muscle degradation), hemolysis, drugs, and exogenous toxins. Many of these compounds cause acute kidney injury (AKI) by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate apoptotic endonucleases. The resulting acute kidney failure (AKF) is a life-threatening condition that requires hemodialysis or kidney transplantation.  This proposal is a continuation of the previous research funded by a VA Merit Review grant. The specific aims in the previous project have been accomplished and the new goals are logical extensions of these aims. The results from the previous study show that the importance of apoptotic endonuclease G (EndoG) in mediating myoglobinuric AKI is much more complex, not limited to DNA fragmentation only, and in some cases, completely opposite to what was initially accepted. The present proposal is based on our recent unexpected observations that myoglobinuric AKI is mediated by apoptotic deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) regulated by EndoG. Prior to this study, no regulation of an endonuclease by another endonuclease has been described, and EndoG was considered one of the DNA-fragmenting apoptotic endonucleases. Contrary to this, we found that when EndoG becomes activated by later or stronger injury, it inactivates DNase I and thus protects against the injury. Therefore in the kidney, EndoG acts as cytoprotective enzyme instead of being cytotoxic.  We hypothesize that myoglobinuric AKI can be prevented by inducing of EndoG-mediated inactivation of DNase I or otherwise inhibiting expression or activity of DNase I before and/or after injury. Our specific objectives are as follows. In Aim 1, we will evaluate native DNase I- and alternatively-spliced DNase I-based therapeutic approaches to ameliorate myoglobinuric tubular cell injury and AKI. In Aim 2, we plan to determine how EndoG-mediated inactivation of DNase I can be used to blunt myoglobunuric AKI. Aim 3 will be using our new high throughput technology to screen chemical library for new DNase I inhibitors applicable for the treatment of myoglobinuric AKI.  Potential Impact on Veterans Health Care. Successful completion of these studies can potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic tools to prevent or ameliorate myoglobinuric AKI. Some of them will have strong translational value because they act even if administered after kidney injury, while others can become therapeutic options of the future. When applied to humans, the results of this study may allow saving human lives, improving the health of veterans, and decreasing the number of disabilities in the veteran population.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a significant risk factor for the development of hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and is also linked to the development of other serious liver disease states including steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatic carcinoma. NAFLD is recognized as a significant health problem in the VA population. Our previous results show that mitochondrial function is linked to the development of NAFLD. Unfortunately, the mechanism(s) that govern hepatic mitochondrial function and thus alter susceptibility for hepatic steatosis remain largely unknown. Peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma co-activator alpha (PGC-1?) co-activates nuclear transcriptional factors resulting in increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Both PGC-1? and mitochondrial function are suppressed in obesity. In contrast, we have shown that in vivo liver-specific PGC-1? overexpression (o/e) increases mitochondrial function and reduces hepatic lipid accumulation. But these results may not be solely attributable to increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Recent data shows that maintenance of high quality mitochondria is also dependent on the turnover and degradation of low functioning or damaged mitochondria in the lysosome by a process termed mitophagy (i.e. autophagy of mitochondria). To that end we found that PGC-1? overexpression also increased markers of autophagy, a link that has never before been examined. This proposal will test the primary hypothesis that PGC- 1? plays a primary role in mediating a coordinated co-activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy that is necessary for maintaining mitochondrial function and preventing and treating NAFLD. Rodent models that possess defects in mitochondrial biogenesis or mitophagy due to specific genetic alterations will be used to test the importance of the respective pathways. We will also use molecular gain of function therapy (overexpression of PGC-1?) and exercise training to modulate pathways, in addition to performing in-vitro primary hepatocyte studies to isolate hepatic specific mechanism(s) and examine acute molecular changes that underlie whole body results. The specific aims will: 1) Determine if impaired capacity for mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy increases susceptibility for hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance due to reduced mitochondrial function, and 2). Test if increased mitophagy and mitochondrial function are necessary for treatment of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Mutations in the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Inclusions enriched in TDP-43 in the cytoplasm of spinal cord neurons in both familial and sporadic ALS are hallmarks of the disease. Two recent yeast genome-wide loss-of-function toxicity suppressor screens revealed the strongest suppressor of TDP-43-mediated toxicity is the ablation of the gene encoding the metallophosphoesterase (MPE) Dbr1, the only enzyme known to hydrolyze the 2',5'-phosphodiester bonds formed within introns during their excision from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. Decreasing Dbr1 activity results in the accumulation of RNA lariats that are proposed to sequester pathogenic TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with normal RNA metabolism. Supporting this hypothesis, knockdown of debranching activity in yeast, a human neuronal cell line, and in primary rat neurons protects them from TDP-43-mediated toxicity. The high degree of sequence identity in the catalytic domains of Dbr1 proteins across all eukaryotic species supports the observation that Dbr1's influence on TDP-43 activity is similar from yeast to man. We recently determined the first crystal structures of an RNA lariat debranching enzyme alone and in complex with a synthetic RNA containing a bona fide branchpoint identical to those found in intron RNA lariats. Dbr1 from the eukaryotic organism Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) crystallized most readily, revealing several unexpected features of Dbr1 enzymes relative to other MPE family members. All Dbr1 enzymes are mononuclear, possessing an invariant active site cysteine residue in the position of the aspartic acid observed in all previously characterized MPE superfamily members, all of which are active as dinuclear enzymes. In addition, all Dbr1 proteins contain a highly conserved insertion loop not found in other MPEs we term the lariat recognition loop (LRL). Functional data coming from in vivo complementation assays using multiple Dbr1 variants expressed in trans in ?dbr1 yeast support the proposed mononuclear enzymatic mechanism, as well as the roles assigned to the various unique structural elements observed in the crystal structures. The structures also reveal the molecular basis for how Dbr1 distinguishes 22,52-phosphodiester linkages from the far more abundant 32,52-phosphodiester linkages. With these results in-hand, we are now in possession of the tools needed to test the hypothesis that inhibition of Dbr1 represents a novel therapeutic avenue to treat TDP-43-mediated ALS. These tools include: 1) large quantities of purified Dbr1 proteins from multiple species, including human; 2) a tested, robust in vitro RNA debranching assay amenable to high throughput screening (HTS) of small molecule libraries for inhibitors; 3) the ability to synthesize, in parallel with the HTS inhibitor search, branched RNA analogs through the introduction of sugar modifications and linkers in order to mimic the conformation of the branched RNA we observe bound to the enzyme crystallographically, which differs from the conformations of these species in solution; 4) an in vivo complementation assay to test the effectiveness of potential inhibitors coming from both of the pipelines mentioned above; 5) the ability to rapidly observe the atomic details of inhibitor?Dbr1 complexes to enable the rational design of compounds with greater affinity and specificity; 6) the ability to perform initial toxiciy screens of candidate Dbr1 inhibitor compounds using cultured human neurons; and 7) the ability to pursue the structure of human Dbr1. The completion of the work outlined in this proposal on the Dbr1 enzyme is required before testing inhibitors in cell-based and murine models of TDP-43 mediated toxicity in ALS can begin.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Burkholderia cepacia complex are emerging as an important group of drug resistant pathogens. The increasing number of infections in immunocompromised patients raises significant concern as antibiotic development continues to lag and our understanding of this unique pathogen still remains undeveloped. Overcoming antibiotic resistance in this genetically highly complex organism possessing multiple chromosomes is a significant medical and scientific challenge. Our main objective is to identify novel ways of overcoming ÃŸ-lactamase-mediated resistance in these and other Gram-negative pathogens. Our previous studies investigating Pen-like ÃŸ-lactamases in Burkholderia spp. lead us to postulate that a novel diazabicyclooctane (DBO) ÃŸ-lactamase inhibitor, avibactam, possesses the correct chemical features to efficiently inactivate PenA. Based upon this chemistry, we will show why avibactam works while clavulanate, sulbactam and tazobactam do not. In addition, strong preliminary evidence we have obtained leads us to hypothesize that the altered regulation of ÃŸ-lactamases (i.e., blapen and blaampC,) by LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) (i.e., PenRA and PenRB) in B. cepacia complex is a critical determinant in ÃŸ-lactam resistance. To address these hypotheses, we will use our knowledge of structure-function relationships of PenA ÃŸ-lactamase to understand the mechanism of inactivation by avibactam and we will employ new genetic and biochemical approaches to dissect the regulation of ÃŸ-lactamase-mediated resistance in B. cepacia complex focusing on the PenRA and PenRB. Studying the pathway to inactivation by avibactam will entail detailed biochemical and mechanistic analyses. Unravelling the complex regulation of PenA ÃŸ-lactamase expression in B. cepacia complex will require us to use the lessons learned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. to understand the steps needed. To address these objectives, the biochemical inhibitory parameters of avibactam will be determined against PenA focusing on key active site residues (i.e., S130, E166, N170, R220, T237, and E276) and obtain a crystal structure of avibactam in the active site of PenA. The in vitro activity of the ceftazidime-avibactam will be assessed against diverse panel of clinical isolates of B. cepacia complex. Next, RNA-seq will be used to define the transcriptome of PenRA and PenRB. PenRA and PenRB from Burkholderia multivorans and Burkholderia cenocepacia, the two most clinically prevalent B. cepacia complex pathogens, will be cloned expressed, and purified. We will assess binding of transcription regulators to DNA and measure ÃŸ-lactamase induction. Finally, we will use site-directed mutagenesis to mutate positions 102, 103, 135, 221, and 264 of PenRA and PenRB and assess the impact of these changes on bla expression. We expect to show that this novel DBO inhibitor will inactivate PenA and that new mechanistic insights will be obtained against this carbapenemase as well as other difficult to inhibit ÃŸ-lactamases. We also anticipate that we will unravel the biochemical features of PenRA and PenRB that are necessary for the transcriptional regulation of bla expression in B. cepacia complex. Ultimately, our long term goal is to identify druggable sites on PenRA and PenRB. LTTRs may serve as a novel targets for therapies in Burkholderia spp. and other Gram-negatives. Achieving our objectives will impact the field by increasing the general understanding needed to identify novel antibiotic targets within problematic Gram-negatives.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Abstract  Stroke is a major medical concern for United States military veterans. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a catastrophic event in the pathogenesis of ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) brain injury. Our recent studies suggested that structural alterations in brain endothelial cells (EC), including abnormal actin polymerization and the resulting redistribution of junctional proteins, is a novel mechanism responsible for early BBB leakage after I/R (30 min-3h); while matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2/9 activation, a predominant mechanism thought to contribute to post-stroke BBB disruption, contribute to the BBB leakage to larger molecules (>40kDa) in a relatively delayed manner. Therefore, restoring EC structure/function may offer an innovative therapeutic strategy for early BBB protection against I/R, while blocking MMP2/9 may provide a relatively delayed protection to BBB.  Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), a member of the small heat shock protein family, confers neuroprotection in several models of CNS diseases, including I/R brain injury. In addition to its well-known protein chaperone and anti-apoptotic functions, HSP27 may act as a potent actin depolymerization factor in certain cell types such as EC, thus potentially inhibiting actin polymerization-mediated BBB disruption. Further, HSP27 may inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB, a central signaling molecule for the production of MMP2/9 and pro-inflammatory mediators. We recently observed that HSP27 is transiently upregulated in brain EC after I/R. However, the precise role of HSP27 in the functional integrity of EC following I/R and the underlying mechanism remain unknown.  Using transgenic mice overexpressing HSP27 and the lentiviral gene-transfection approach, we have obtained novel pilot data showing that HSP27 overexpression protects the endothelium from I/R-induced hyperpermeability in vitro and in vivo; that HSP27 inhibited oxygen glucose deprivation-induced actin polymerization and redistribution of junctional proteins in EC; and that intravenous administration of HSP27 containing a cell permeable transduction domain (TAT-HSP27) enabled rapid delivery of the protein into brain micro-vasculatures, reduced BBB damage and inhibited MMP2/9 activity after I/R. This proposal will further explore the BBB protective effect of HSP27 on I/R brain injury and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The central hypothesis to be tested is that HSP27 protects BBB against I/R injury by stabilizing EC cytoskeletal organization in microvasculature early after I/R and inhibiting the production of MMP2/9 as well as pro-inflammatory proteins. The following specific aims are proposed:  Aim 1: To determine whether endothelial targeted overexpression of HSP27 is sufficient to provide early protection on BBB integrity and to confer long term protection against cerebral I/R.  Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that HSP27 protects endothelial integrity following I/R by dualistic mechanisms: stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton and inhibiting NFkB-dependent MMP2/9 production and inflammation.  Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that post-stroke delivery of TAT-HSP27 to EC protects against BBB damage and improves outcomes in both young adult and aged mice.  The proposed study attempts to develop HSP27 into a novel, clinically feasible therapeutic strategy to ameliorate post-stroke BBB damage, brake down the progression of brain damage, and improve long-term neurological functions in stroke victims. The successful completion of this proposed study will help improve the quality of life for veterans suffering from stroke.',\n",
       " 'Coronary artery disease is the principal cause of myocardial infarction (MI) and a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality in the veteran population. A consequence of MI is congestive heart failure (CHF), which is secondary to defective myocardial remodeling post-infarct. Recent studies have demonstrated a significant role for inflammation and immune cells in cardiac remodeling, particularly infiltrating monocyte/macrophage cells in cardiac repair. We recently determined that the oral immunosuppressant FTY720 is cardioprotective and increases survival in mouse models of coronary ligation and accelerated atherosclerosis leading to heart failure. While FTY720 has been shown to exert direct protective cell signaling effects in cardiac myocytes, its effects on immune cells, which result in cardioprotection have not been delineated. Our proposal focuses on our central hypothesis that cardiac ischemic injury initiates an inflammatory response that promotes abnormal cardiac remodeling which can be interrupted by immune modulation. Our proposal will determine specific changes in immune cells following FTY720 treatment that correlate with improved outcomes and determine if an optimal window for protective immune modulation exists following an ischemic event. By identifying specific changes induced by immune modulation, we will determine mechanisms that initiate beneficial cardioprotective immune responses that will be useful to target therapeutically and identify biomarkers that reflect the pathological aspects of the immune responses to MI. We will investigate the hypothesis that FTY720 improves cardiac repair following an ischemic event by altering the influx, phenotype and function of cardiac monocyte-derived macrophages. We will explore potential cardioprotective mechanisms for FTY720 effects: 1) a direct effect of FTY720 on macrophage polarization and/or 2) a primary effect of FTY720 on lymphocyte egress. We will also determine whether a short, critical period of FTY720-driven immune modulation can improve outcomes in an ischemia-reperfusion model. Aim 1: Determine if FTY720 treatment alters post-infarct cardiac macrophage phenotype  and function. Aim 2: Determine if cardio-protective effects of FTY720 against ischemic injury are  dependent on B lymphocyte trafficking. Aim 3: Determine if a limited window of FTY720 treatment is cardioprotective following  ischemic injury. Our multi-PI proposal leverages the expertise of established investigators with diverse areas of expertise in cardiac remodeling, immunity and macrophage biology. Together we are well positioned to explore how modulation of immunity can impact and improve cardiac repair. Significantly, our findings will define mechanisms by which FTY720 improves post-ischemic cardiac remodeling and survival, which could lead to new therapeutics to improve repair post-MI and decrease CHF. Our project is novel in that it seeks to define a mechanism of beneficial immune modulation in the post-ischemia setting and will identify how FTY720 alters cardiac inflammation post-ischemia/reperfusion injury and the cell types responsible for cardioprotection.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Alcohol-related health problems are the worldwide health concern. More than 50% of Veterans use alcohol and nearly 23% are binge or heavy drinkers. Pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) involves endotoxemia caused by gut barrier dysfunction. About 25% of alcoholics develop ALD, but the factors that make them susceptible to ALD remain to be determined. The relationship between stress and alcoholism is well known, so this project focuses on the effects of stress on alcoholic tissue injury. Our preliminary studies showed that different types of stress  disrupt tight junctions (TJs) and increase permeability in the intestinal epithelium by a mechanism that involves intracellular signaling elements. Preliminary data also indicated that chronic restraint stress exacerbates alcohol-induced gut permeability and associated liver injury. Probiotics are well known to promote gastrointestinal cell survival and barrier function. Our preliminary data indicated that Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) ameliorates stress and ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction. On the basis of these results it is hypothesized that: a) stress-induced cell signaling promotes alcohol-induced TJ disruption and barrier dysfunction in the intestinal epithelium, b) chronic stress exacerbates ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction, endotoxemia and liver injury by a CaV1.3 channel and JNK2-dependent mechanism, and c) L. casei ameliorates stress and ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction, endotoxemia and liver injury. Using a cell culture model of the intestinal epithelium and gene knock out mice we will determine that: 1) Ca2+-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress mediates stress-induced activation of Ask1/MKK7/JNK2/c-Src signaling and TJ disruption in the intestinal epithelium, 2) Glucocorticoids mediate stress-induced cell signaling in the intestinal epithelium and exacerbation of alcoholic gut permeability, 3) Stress-activated signaling promotes acetaldehyde-induced TJ disruption, 4) CaV1.3 channel and [Ca2+]i mediate the synergistic effects of chronic stress and ethanol on gut and liver, 5) Down regulation of JNK2 blocks stress and alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction and liver injury, 6) L. casei prevents stress-induced cell signalin and attenuates acetaldehyde-induced TJ disruption in Caco-2 cells and mouse intestine ex vivo, 7) L. casei attenuates stress and ethanol- induced gut permeability and liver injury in vivo, and 8) Peptide-like factor released by L. casei blocks gut barrier dysfunction and prevents liver injur caused by stress and ethanol. The outcome of these studies will have direct impact on the fields of stress-induced alteration of intestinal mucosal homeostasis as well as pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.  .',\n",
       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Alzheimer disease (AD) produces a progressive degeneration of the brain that slowly destroys a victim's cognitive abilities. This disease inflicts tremendous social and economic burden on families and society in general. It is projected that more than 200,000 Veterans will be diagnosed with dementia in 2017, with AD the most common cause. Therapeutic options for AD remain very limited and no treatments have been shown to slow the relentless progression of the disease. Pathologically AD is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-? (A?) derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule associated protein tau that results in the formation of tangles inside neurons. These protein deposits are associated with a dramatic loss of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus. The mechanistic relationship between these protein accumulations and neurodegeneration is, however, unknown. Synaptic dysfunction and loss of axon terminals are among the earliest recognized changes in AD, suggesting that impairment of mechanisms that maintain integrity of synapses may underlie or contribute to pathology. Removal and replacement of damaged proteins (proteostasis) is a primary mechanism by which cells maintain functional structures such as mitochondria. Clearance is mediated by two interconnected systems-the ubitquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome system. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that there may be locally regulated proteostasis programs at presynaptic terminals. In our preliminary data we demonstrate that the autophagy-lysosome system is upregulated specifically at synapses in response to A?. In this Pilot Project we propose to test the hypothesis that presynaptic autophagy plays a crucial role in the neurodegeneration that occurs in AD. To test the hypothesis, we have generated two presynaptically targeted molecular regulators of autophagy - one enhancer and one suppressor. We propose to determine the consequences of altering presynaptic autophagy on an in vitro model of AD as well as a murine model of the disease. At the end of the proposed studies we expect to have a better understanding of autophagy of presynaptic structures and how this process relates to neurodegeneration in AD. This knowledge will hopefully help us to identify novel targets for the treatments that slow the progress of this devastating disease.\",\n",
       " \"[ Persistent memory impairment is one of the most common complaints after brain injury and is the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI; a transitional stage between healthy aging and AD). The prevalence of these conditions is increasing, as 40% of the VA population is elderly and age is the greatest risk factor for AD. Head injury also increases the risk of developing AD and the incidence of brain injury in Veterans (and the memory sequelae that accompanies it) has increased in recent years due to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Efforts to understand the functional and structural substrates of memory impairment have focused almost entirely on impaired new learning. Impaired remembering of the past (retrograde memory [RM] loss) has received little attention even though this impairment is particularly devastating (e.g., one forgets family relationships, important events, and facts about the world). Although impaired new learning is well studied, RM has received less attention even though Veterans with MCI and AD exhibit severe RM loss. Interestingly, individuals with MCI can exhibit relatively mild impairment in new learning in conjunction with relatively severe RM loss, suggesting that a new tool to detect RM loss could serve as an early estimate of cognitive and neural decline associated with the development of AD. Older Veterans exhibit changes in brain structure and function as the result of aging, and Veterans with aMCI exhibit even more significant changes in the brain. We will study RM in these two groups and identify brain regions (and connections between brain regions) where measures of structure and function are related to performance on RM tests. The two goals of the proposal are 1) to identify which brain regions support RM in cognitively normal older Veterans; and then 2) determine if a RM test could serve as a novel and unique gauge of the cognitive and neural changes associated RM loss in MCI. As time passes after learning, it is thought that the role of the hippocampus and related structures in supporting memory retrieval gradually decreases, whereas the role of the prefrontal cortex and other cortical areas gradually increase (memory consolidation). These observations are typically observed across years and decades in humans but, curiously, across days and weeks in animals. The proposed studies will identify the neuroanatomy of RM for both the short and longer time frames. In addition, we will identify the relevant neuroanatomy using four neuroimaging measures (i.e., 2 focusing on brain regions and 2 focusing on connections between brain regions). For the longer time frame, memory for facts will be tested during functional brain imaging (fMRI). The facts will concern 160 notable news events that occurred 1 to 30 years earlier. For the short time frame, memory will be tested during scanning for 320 fact- like, three-word sentences that were learned 1 hour to 1 month earlier. Measures of grey and white matter structure will also be obtained from anatomical magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging, respectively. To identify regions where structural changes correlate with the accuracy of RM, we will identify correlations between measures of brain structure (grey matter and white matter) and performance on the RM tests. Measures of brain function will be obtained from task-related fMRI activity and task-related fMRI functional connectivity. To identify regions where function correlates with RM, we will identify regions where brain activity and brain connectivity change with the age of memory. Next, we will ask which findings for structure and function are common to both time frames. Then, we will determine if the brain regions important for RM in cognitively normal older Veterans are dysfunctional or damaged in Veterans with aMCI. Finally, for developing a practical RM test, we will identify a subset of the questions that best predict genetic, neuropsychological, and neural risk for developing AD. We anticipate that a RM test can serve as a robust and sensitive clinical measure for staging preclinical AD or gauging the efficacy of treatments in Veterans with neurodegenerative disorders and reduce the burden on caregivers and VA Healthcare. ]\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that function as powerful regulators of gene networks. Although they were classically thought to function only within the cell, strikingly stable populations of extracellular microRNAs (ex-miRNAs) have been discovered in a variety of body fluids. Because their profile in serum is altered in many cancers such as prostate cancer, ex-miRNAs hold promise as a tool for cancer detection and treatment prognosis. Additionally, many studies are revealing a possible biological utility for ex- miRNAs shuttled between cells in extracellular vesicles, called exosomes, as mediators of paracrine signaling. Despite growing interest in the function of secreted ex-miRNAs and their clinical application as biomarkers for cancer, we still lack understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ex-miRNA packaging and secretion. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the steps of selection for miRNAs during packaging and secretion via exosomes and determine how oncogenic stimuli can affect these mechanisms. I hypothesize that selective miRNA secretion is controlled by selective multivesicular body release and mechanisms of intraluminal vesicle formation, both of which are modulated by oncogenic signaling. These studies will shed light on the biological implication of ex-miRNAs in paracrine signaling and further our understanding of how to utilize them as novel biomarkers for cancer. This research project is crafted to facilitate my development into a versatile scientist capable of becoming a leader in academia. To achieve this goal, my training plan will help me advance my skills in biochemistry, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. My instruction will also be supported by coursework in cancer biology, ethics, and statistics/data analysis. I will further my career development by improving my communication and writing skills directly from my sponsor and other mentors, as well as taking advantage of classes and seminars offered at UCSF. The resources and mentorship afforded to me in this setting will give me the best opportunity to achieve my goal of leading an independent laboratory in the future.',\n",
       " 'Homeostatic survival of B lymphocytes is carefully regulated, and disruption of this regulation is an important factor in pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases and B cell malignancies. The latter are the most common hematologic cancers in the US population as well as in Veterans, in whom age/gender status, as well as exposures related to their service, can increase risk of B cell cancers. The signaling adapter protein TRAF3 plays an important, B-cell-specific role in restraining homeostatic survival and B cell activation. B cell TRAF3 deficiency in a mouse model causes abnormally high B cell survival that results in accumulation and infiltration of multiple organs and tissue with B cells, autoantibody production, and predisposition to B cell tumors. In humans, mutations of the TRAF3 gene are now recognized as common in B cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma. The proposed project will address the hypothesis that functional TRAF3 deficiency can also be caused by cellular events leading to TRAF3 membrane sequestration and/or degradation. Thus, TRAF3- regulated B cell survival abnormalities can contribute to an even higher proportion of malignancies than just those with genetic TRAF3 mutations. The proposed project will also build upon new information acquired during the most recent funding period, identifying B cell survival pathways regulated by TRAF3. The goals of the project are to determine how cellular signaling results in functional TRAF3 deficiency in B cells, and to identify TRAF3-regulated targetable B cell survival pathways, in both model systems and samples of human B cell malignancies, via the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the mechanisms and impact of TRAF3- receptor interactions and TRAF3 deficiency on TRAF3-regulated B cell survival pathways. 2) Identify drugs/compounds effective in selectively blocking the abnormally enhanced viability of TRAF3-deficient B cells. 3) Define the association between TRAF3 status and B cell survival pathways, in human B cell malignancies. The expected outcomes of the proposed project are an accurate and detailed understanding of how B cell survival is regulated by TRAF3-mediated pathways, how key pathways can be targeted to counteract enhanced survival of TRAF3-deficient B cells, and how TRAF3 status is related to phenotype in BCL and MM. This knowledge is expected to provide valuable information to inform the best selection of therapeutic options and strategies to prevent and treat drug resistance and recurrence in human B cell malignancies.',\n",
       " 'Numerous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have established that circulating levels of testosterone decline with age in men, and this decline has been associated with parallel age-related metabolic and pathophysiological changes such as increased fat mass, cardiovascular risk, and incidence of frailty, depression, osteopenia, osteoporosis, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and decreased muscle/bone mass, and sexual function. Likewise, aging of the human ovary also results in a gradual decline in ovarian steroid production, followed by an abrupt and complete cessation of both progesterone and estrogen production at the onset of menopause. Similarly, human aging is accompanied by a dramatic decline in adrenal androgens (DHEA, DHEAS) and alterations in cortisol and aldosterone production and secretion. Similar to humans, aging in experimental rodents is also associated with profound changes in the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones, particularly testosterone. Moreover, most of the age-induced alterations in the testicular (testosterone) and adrenal steroid responses in experimental rodents are reflective of the response in humans. Although the various cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling this aging defect in rodents have not been unequivocally identified, recent studies mainly from this laboratory have established a causal link between increased ROS formation/excessive oxidative stress and oxidative damage (especially from life-long continued processing of cholesterol for steroid production) to the cellular machinery involved in cholesterol transport to mitochondria, resulting in attenuated cholesterol transport with consequent impairment of steroidogenesis during aging. The cytosolic Sod1peroxiredoxins (Prdx) and mitochondrial Sod2 peroxiredoxins are the most potent anti-oxidant defense systems in steroid producing cells. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the functional expression of both cytosolic and mitochondrial Sod-Prdx antioxidant axes is coordinately and robustly downregulated most likely via excessive oxidative damage during aging. Using the above information, we propose the following 3 specific aims to investigate our hypothesis that increased ROS formation/excessive oxidative stress and ensuing oxidative damage to cytosolic and mitochondrial Sod-Prdx antioxidant axes, leads to downregulation of functional expression of crucial proteins involved in cholesterol transport to (SNAREs) and within the mitochondria (StAR) for side- chain cleavage (Cyp11a1), resulting in impaired cholesterol transport to mitochondria and failed steroidogenesis. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of oxidant-sensitive p38 MAPK will attenuate or prevent age-related decline in steroid hormone synthesis and secretion. Specific Aim 1: Examine a functional link between ROS induced impairment of expression of components of the Sod-Prdx axes and oxidative stress-induced down-regulation of SNAREs and StAR, resulting in loss of steroidogenic response during aging; Specific Aim 2: Assess the contribution of Sods and Prdx proteins in ROS-mediated inhibition/inactivation of specific SNAREs and StAR, impaired cholesterol transport to mitochondria, and inhibition of steroidogenesis in aging; and Specific Aim 3: Determine whether pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of p38 MAPK reverses impaired steroidogenesis during aging or in antioxidant-deficient mouse models. The planned studies involve a multi- level approach including use of state-of-the art biochemical, cell biology, and molecular biology techniques, several metabolic aging mouse and rat models, and genetically altered mice with increased or decreased expression of specific antioxidant enzymes and pharmacological intervention strategies to achieve the stated goals.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Up to one third of the 700,000 men and women who served in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm during the 1990-1991 Gulf War (GW) have developed a chronic multisystem illness known as Gulf War Veterans' Illness (GWVI). Neurobehavioral findings include memory problems, executive system deficits, slowed motor and processing speeds, sustained attention deficits, reduced visuospatial skills and psychomotor dysfunction. Given the spectrum of cognitive deficits noted above, combined with evidence of structural and functional abnormalities on neuroimaging, it is likely that neuropathological changes also occur in GWVI. Several environmental exposures have been implicated as potential contributors to GWVI including exposure to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as pyridostigmine bromide (PB; anti-nerve gas pills) and organophosphate (OP) pesticides/nerve agents (e.g., sarin/cyclosarin). The pattern of deficits may be related to whether GWV were exposed to OP nerve agents as well as their premorbid vulnerability (e.g., PON1 status) to such exposures. GWV may also be at higher risk for developing a progressive neurodegenerative disorder    such as Alzheimer's Disease as they age. Some studies suggest that accelerated aging may occur in GWVI related to axonal transport deficits, increased axial diffusivity, increased WM anisotropy on diffusion tensor imaging and insulin resistance and/or metabolic syndrome. Findings of reduced hippocampal volume in GWV suggest that that the pattern of deficits may be consistent the development of an Alzheimer-type dementia. This is important to investigate because the GWV cohort in general is aging; 52% of GWV are age 45 and older and 16% are age 55 to 85+. In addition, recent evidence suggests that an unexpectedly large number of GW veterans sustained traumatic brain injuries (TBI) so they may also be at risk for long term sequelae such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Given the issues raised above, there is a critical need for a GWVI CNS tissue biorepository that will conduct extensive ante mortem longitudinal assessments on enrolled GWV.    Our first specific aim is to establish a VA GWVIB as a national resource to support research on the etiology and pathogenesis of GWRI and our second aim is to perform selected psychometric and biological assessments on enrollees to maximize the value of tissue donated to the GWVIB. Well-characterized CNS tissue when combined with antemortem health data and biological assessments (such as ApoE genotype and serum PON1 activity) will be invaluable to advance research on GWVI. The GWVIB will be a multi-site collaboration among VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) and the Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System (SAVAHCS). The GWVIB will utilize strengths across the Boston and Tucson sites in enrollment, tissue collection, processing, storage, neuropathological diagnosis, medical informatics and data management. VABHS will serve as the operations/data coordinating center and conduct the neuropathological diagnostic analyses, with SAVAHCS contributing expertise in CNS tissue processing and storage. SAVAHCS will also coordinate CNS tissue distribution. Notable enhancements to be initiated are the utilization of an active versus passive recruitment approach, enlarging our collection of tissue from Veteran controls through a collaboration with the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI), and improved outreach to investigators to increase the utilization of the GWVIB in GWI research. This will allow us to leverage the substantial investment of VA resources already in place at GWVIB and to add value to existing clinical and CNS tissue resources.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Allergic diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy, have been steadily increasing in incidence and disproportionately affect children. Allergic responses can be triggered rapidly upon exposure to an allergen that binds to IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils; these cells then degranulate and release potent pro-inflammatory mediators. If this response occurs systemically, known as anaphylaxis, it can be life- threatening. However, despite the importance of IgE in allergic disease, the intrinsic mechanisms that regulate IgE-expressing B cells remain unclear. Recent technical advances have made it possible to directly detect and visualize IgE+ B cells in mice, revealing that IgE+ B cells undergo an abortive germinal center phase and are predisposed to differentiate into short-lived plasma cells. These properties of IgE+ B cells restrain IgE responses and therefore may help protect against allergy and anaphylaxis in healthy individuals. Recent studies have demonstrated that the distinct features of mouse IgE+ B cells are largely due to the expression of the membrane IgE B cell receptor, which has weak, chronic signaling activity compared with other isotypes. The overall objective of this study is to determine how B cell receptor signaling regulates IgE+ B cell responses in mice and whether these findings are applicable to human B cells. The specific goals of this study are to 1) elucidate the mechanisms by which B cell receptor signaling regulates IgE plasma cell responses, 2) to characterize the role of B cell receptor signaling in the dynamics of IgE+ B cells in germinal centers, and 3) to determine whether human IgE B cell receptors regulate IgE responses in a similar fashion to mouse IgE B cell receptors. The results from these studies will help us understand how potent IgE-mediated allergic responses are controlled at a molecular level. .',\n",
       " 'Current therapies for autoimmune diseases target the symptoms rather than the cause of autoimmunity. The chronic use of immunosuppressants leads to deliberating side effects. An attractive alternative is to treat the underlying cause by boosting regulatory T cells (Tregs) in patients with autoimmunity. Our group established that IL-2 is an essential cytokine for Tregs. Moreover, we have established in pre-clinical studies that low IL-2R signaling promotes Tregs but not T effector/memory (TEM) cells. This finding has led to the notion that low-dose (LD) IL-2 may selectively expand Tregs. Importantly, LD IL-2 therapy has shown promising results in patients with chronic GvHD, HCV vasculitis, and several autoimmune diseases. Correspondingly, several fundamental questions emerge about LD IL-2 immunotherapy. These include: What is the selectivity of LD IL-2 for Tregs? What is the mechanism by which Tregs preferentially respond to low levels of IL-2? Is there individual variation in responsiveness to LD IL-2? What are the molecular consequences in Treg and Teff cells in response to LD IL-2? Does chronic exposure to LD IL-2 alter the capacity of Tregs to respond to IL-2? Our supporting data has defined a window of selectivity of human Tregs for IL-2R signaling when compared to CD45RO CD4 TEM ++ cells. However, the extent that Tregs exclusive respond to LD IL-2 remains a point of contention. We also have preliminary data that IL-2-dependent gene activation in Tregs may vary in normal subjects. This latter point is of interest because some individuals may be more suitable candidates for this therapy. We plan to build on these results and capitalize on our expertise on IL-2 to better understand mechanistically the potential of LD IL- 2 as a treatment platform for autoimmune diseases. The premise of this application is: In comparison to TEM cells, low levels of IL-2R signaling selectively and substantially activates an IL-2-dependent transcriptional program in Tregs that is uniquely shaped by TCR and co-stimulatory signaling; this selective gene activation varies between individuals and accounts for variable responses to LD IL-2 therapy. The following specific aims are proposed to address this premise: 1) To establish the immediate and down-stream consequences of IL-2R signaling by LD IL-2 on gene regulation in human Treg and Teff cells in vitro alone or in the context of TCR and co-stimulatory signaling; 2) to evaluate cellular and molecular levels through which the response by human Tregs varies to LD IL-2 in normal subjects and in patients with Type 1 diabetes; and 3) to evaluate the consequence of IL-2 in Treg and TEM cells in patients undergoing LD IL-2 therapy. These experiments will assess the outcome of IL-2R signaling due to variation of IL-2 dose and the type of autoimmune disease.',\n",

       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Elevated levels of glucose and/or lipids in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are thought to negatively affect islet function and survival (so-called `glucotoxicity', `lipotoxicity', or `gluco-lipotoxiciy'), leading to a further impairment of insulin secretion and worsening glycemic control. However, much of the evidence for glucotoxicity or lipotoxicity has come from studies of rodent islets or rodent models of T2DM (ob/ob, db/db, ZDF, high-fat diet, etc.). This is problematic because human islets have critical differences from rodent islets. Thus, our understanding of the mechanistic events in human islets exposed to excess glucose and lipid in vivo is quite limited. These fundamental gaps in our knowledge, which are partly the result of experimental limitations of studying human islets in vivo and partly from limitations in our knowledge of human islet biology, restrict our ability to develop interventions to preserve beta cell function. To address these limitations, we developed new pre-clinical, experimental approaches that allow mechanistic analysis of human islets exposed to excess glucose and/or lipid in vivo (human islets transplanted into immunodeficient mice). Based on our in vivo and in vitro data, we hypothesize that excess glucose and/or lipid in vivo (glucotoxicity or lipotoxicity) compromises the function and/or expression of these key islet-enriched transcription factors in human islets, leading to impaired insulin secretion and biosynthesis and the worsening islet function in T2DM. We propose three aims to test this hypothesis: 1) Define the degree, duration, and mechanism(s) by which hyperglycemia alters human islet function in vivo. 2) Determine whether excess lipid worsens the effects of hyperglycemia on human islet function in vivo. 3) Determine whether excess glucose and/or lipid impair human islet function in vivo by similar or distinct mechanisms. The proposed studies bring together new information and technologies related to islet-enriched transcription factors and human islet biology, as well as new experimental models that allow for human islets to be studied in vivo in ways that have not previously been possible. The proposed studies address a critical problem in T2DM, namely the molecular mechanisms of glucotoxicity and/or lipotoxicity, and should drive new efforts to design interventions to preserve  or improve beta cell function.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists such as morphine, fentanyl and remifentanil (remi) are the most effective perioperative analgesics for both acute severe postoperative pain and chronic severe pain states. The most serious, life-threatening side effect, which limits their dosage, is profound depression of breathing rate (bradypnea) and tidal volume. This risk is increased in the presence of other sedatives such as benzodiazepines (BZDs) and alcohol. Our studies indicate that neurons in the parabrachial/ K?lliker-Fuse nuclei (PB-KF complex) of the pons are very sensitive to low clinical opioid concentrations associated with bradypnea and have the potential to cause respiratory arrest. We have also discovered that neurons in a small parabrachial subregion (PBSR) control breathing frequency (fB) and appear to be the portal that mediates the opioid-induced bradypnea. Localized excitation of PBSR neurons increase fB, while those that decrease neuronal activity decrease fB even to the point of apnea. Thus, any drugs that affect the activity of PBSR neurons will have a major impact on breathing. Our working hypothesis is the PBSR functions as the major controller of fB by providing excitatory inputs to the rhythmogenic preB?tzinger Complex (preBC) that produces phasic inspiratory (I) and expiratory (E) neuronal discharge patterns. Depression of PBSR neuronal activity by systemically administered opioids alone or combined with sedatives leads to severe bradypnea or arrest. The PBSR also modulates the gain of the reflex control of I-duration (TI) and E-duration (TE) mediated by slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (PSRs). To address the above hypotheses, the following specific aims will be pursued: 1) Precisely locate the PBSR in the dorsal pons near the PB-KF area that controls eupneic fB as suggested by preliminary findings, 2) Identify the PBSR neuron subtypes, determine if their axons project to the preBC/BC region and quantify their responses to PSR inputs, 3) determine how the discharge patterns of the various PBSR neuron subtypes are generated and controlled by A) NMDA and nonNMDA receptor mediated glutamatergic endogenous excitation and B) by GABAergic and glycinergic endogenous inhibition, 4) determine A) whether the GABAA receptors on neurons within this region are modulated by BZDs (e.g., midazolam), B) whether systemically-administered BZDs act on neurons within the PBSR (antagonized by microinjected flumazenil), and C) whether microinjected BZDs modulate the effects of iv remifentanil-induced    bradypnea, 5) determine the role of GABAB receptors in the modulation of PBSR neurons and of TI and TE via microinjections of selective agonists and antagonists, 6) identify preBC neuron subtypes that mediate increases in fB evoked within the PBSR by AMPA stimulation and highly localized electrical stimuli, and 7 A) characterize the modulation of the PSR reflex control of TI and TE mediated by the PBSR, and B) and determine whether this modulation is due to PBSR inputs to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) that alter the PSR neurotransmission to the second order neurons. Systemic i.v. infusions of ultra short-acting remifentanil will be used to produce bradypnea in an in vivo decerebrate canine model. Phrenic nerve activity will be recorded to measure TI and TE. Multibarrel micropipettes and a 16-electrode probe (NeuroNexus) will be used to simultaneously record the discharge of PBSR neurons while picoejecting neuroactive agents. Responses to PSR inputs and axon projections to the preBC region will be used to further classify the PBSR neurons. The PBSR appears to act as the portal through which breathing rate is controlled. Thus, the study of the neurophysiological and neuropharmacological characteristics of this discrete region will provide major insight into the mechanisms by which drugs adversely affect breathing frequency and suggest therapeutic measures to alleviate undesirable side effects. These studies will also provide important new information on the functional roles of PBSR neurons and the contribution of specific neurotransmitters/modulators to the discharge patterns of PBSR neuron subtypes in vivo and new insights into control of breathing mechanisms.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Cystogenesis is critical for early kidney development; however, if renal cystogenesis is delayed and/or occurs in an incorrect context, the resulting cysts can destroy kidney structure, thereby promoting polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and renal failure. Virtually all forms of PKD in human patients and animal models are associated with perturbations in renal primary cilia structure and/or function. For example, mutations in genes encoding the ciliary proteins polycystins-1 and -2 cause autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD), the most common potentially lethal monogenic disorder in humans, while mutations in multiple ciliary proteins lead to nephronophthisis, a form of PKD that is the most common genetic cause of renal failure in children and young adults. Although maintenance of primary cilia structure and function appears to be key to preventing/treating PKD, it is not entirely clear how aberrant ciliogenesis promotes disease. Moreover, since there are no approved treatments for any form of PKD, and even the most promising treatments have significant side effects and/or toxicities, a more thorough understanding of primary cilia formation/function is critical for the identification of future therapeutic targets for the treatment of PKD. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to identify the mechanistic basis for ciliogenesis, and determine how aberrations in this process contribute to PKD. Our laboratory was the first to show that the highly-conserved eight-protein exocyst complex, which promotes targeting and docking of vesicles carrying proteins from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), localizes to, and is necessary for formation of, primary cilia. Notably, mutations in an exocyst protein, identified in a family with nephronophthisis, support a role for the exocyst in prevention of PKD. The exocyst has been shown to be critical for targeting Rab8-positive vesicles bearing ciliary proteins to the nascent cilium. More recently, we demonstrated that both the small GTPase Cdc42 and Tuba, a Cdc42 ciliary-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), regulate targeting of the exocyst itself to the nascent cilium, where the Sec10 component of the exocyst directly interacts with the Par complex. Most notably, we recently demonstrated that cdc42 knockdown in zebrafish causes ciliary defects and Cdc42 kidney-specific knockout in mice prevents ciliogenesis, which leads to a PKD nephronophthisis phenotype, renal failure, and death. Preliminary data show that tuba knockdown in zebrafish results in a similar phenotype. Based on these data, we hypothesize that activation of Cdc42 by one or more ciliary-specific GEFs is required to recruit the exocyst to the nascent cilium, thereby  promoting Sec10/Par6 stabilizing interactions that allow for the targeting of Rab8-positive vesicles bearing ciliary proteins to promote ciliogenesis (tested in Aims 1 and 2). We are in a unique position to undertake these experiments as we have all the necessary tools, techniques, and reagents. As proper cilia formation and function are critical for preventing PKD, further understanding of a major delivery route for ciliary proteins will likely identify a number of novel  candidate targets and points of therapeutic intervention. We also showed that Cdc42 and Sec10 disruption in vitro and in vivo leads to MAPK activation and an increase in phosphorylated ERK (pERK). As MAPK activation occurs in the nephronophthisis pcy mouse, and pharmacologic normalization of pERK prevents cystogenesis, we further hypothesize that inhibition of exocyst localization/stabilization at the nascent cilium results in abnormal MAPK activation that, in turn,  leads to PKD. In Aim 3, we will take a pharmacologic approach to test this hypothesis in our Cdc42 and Sec10 knockdown zebrafish and conditional murine knockout models, and will also exploit our recently described novel adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector, and retrograde delivery system, that allows for gene expression in murine kidney tubule cells. Taken together, our work opens up new avenues for the treatment of PKD: utilizing pharmacologic means to inhibit the MAPK pathway, and molecular biology to deliver wild-type genes to rescue inherited ciliopathies.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Abstract: Clonal diseases of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) are characterized by lymphocytosis and autoimmune manifestations including rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary hypertension, and bone marrow failure. Several related syndromes have similar pathology involving the bone marrow including aplastic anemia (AA), paroxysmal nocturnal hemaglobinuria (PNH), and a subset of patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Clinical improvement occurs after immunosuppressive therapy (IST) suggesting that activated T-cell induce this syndrome. The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with LGL leukemia and other diseases associated with hyperactive memory T-cells. In our earlier studies of survival regulation in this disease, our lab was the first to demonstrate constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factor (STAT3) DNA binding. STAT-family proteins, including STAT3, play a critical role in many biological processes. They have proven oncogenic potential in several forms of cancer including breast, prostate, pancreas, leukemia and lymphoma. Until recently, the mechanism causing STAT3 activation was unknown. Recurrent mutations in the STAT3 Src homology-2 (SH2) domain were identified through exome sequencing by two independent international groups in 2012. More than 80% of the STAT3 mutations result in amino acid substitutions at position Y640F or D661Y (called mutSTAT3 throughout the application). Although these two amino acids have no known function in STAT3 activation, they have the potential to alter major protein-protein interactions with activated cytokine receptors or to strengthen carboxy-terminal phosphotyrosine 705 (Y705)-mediated dimerization. There is a known linkage between STAT3 and memory T-cell differentiation. A dominant negative STAT3 mutation occurs in patients with Hyper IgE Syndrome (HIES, or Job Syndrome). In these patients, a reduction in central memory T-cell development suggests that STAT3 may be involved in the regulation of memory T-cell differentiation. Mice with targeted deletion of STAT3 in T-cells also have a loss of central memory T-cells and an accumulation of inactive terminal memory cells during viral infection. Overexpression of active STAT3 in T-cells will close an important knowledge gap in the precise role of STAT3 in memory T-cell differentiation. Since the Y640F and D661Y represent the first naturally-occurring mutations with potential for gain-of-function, we will be able to address important questions with human disease relevance. The hypothesis to be tested in this application is that the naturally-occurring STAT3 mutations (Y640F and D661Y) alter SH2 domain structural properties leading to constitutive activation. Expression of this activated form of STAT3 then contributes to aberrant survival and expansion of T-cells with an effector memory phenotype capable of injuring normal tissues. Our research design will include three specific aims (SA): 1) to prove that naturally-occurring STAT3 mutations (mutSTAT3) increase survival by altering the STAT3 activation threshold, 2) to prove that Y640F and D661Y alter SH2 peptide domain interactions and serve as a unique target for drug design and, 3) to confirm our hypothesis that mutSTAT3 induces T-cell activation in memory T-cells to induce survival and tissue damage. Due to the prevalence and health care costs associated with autoimmune cytopenias, and the overwhelming devastation and poor treatment options of autoimmune diseases in Veterans, we believe our project is broadly relevant to the Veteran population and is focused on a critical health problem of interest to VA R&D.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         In utero alcohol exposure may lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), which cause learning deficits. Alcohol abuse is a well-known problem in the veteran population, which includes a growing number of women of childbearing age. Some of the effects of ethanol in the developing brain have been attributed to a premature loss of neuronal plasticity. Astrocytes play a major role in mediating neuronal plasticity and in the formation of neuronal connectivity during development. We have recently shown that cholinergic stimulation of astrocytes in vitro increases the levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins laminin and fibronectin, which trigger neuritogenesis in hippocampal neurons while ethanol decreases the levels of neuritogenic ECM in astrocytes and astrocyte-induced neuritogenesis. Neuritogenic ECM proteins can be modulated by changes in their rate of degradation. In preliminary studies we found that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), involved in the degradation of the ECM, are upregulated by ethanol. Our studies also suggest that the epigenetic mechanism of DNA methylation may be involved in this effect of ethanol, as ethanol inhibits DNA methyltrasferases (DNMTs) and tPA promoter DNA methylation in astrocytes, events associated with increased gene expression. We hypothesize that ethanol-induced inhibition of DNMT activity in astrocytes increases the expression of proteins involved in ECM degradation and inhibits hippocampal plasticity. Consistent with our findings, DNA methylation is delayed by ethanol during development. Ethanol- induced DNMT activity and DNA methylation changes in astrocytes and their consequences on neurons are unexplored. The most promising treatment for FASD is choline, which can be converted to phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major membrane phospholipid, and, in the liver and kidney only, to methionine and then to s- adenosylmethionine (SAM), the main methyl donor in the enzymatic reaction of DNA methylation catalyzed by DNMT enzymes. The neurochemical mechanisms by which choline supplementation ameliorates hippocampal functions affected by prenatal alcohol exposure remains elusive. Preliminary studies show that, in vitro, astrocyte treatment with both choline and SAM prevents ethanol-induced DNMT inhibition. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that ethanol inhibits DNMT activity, decreases tPA and uPA promoter DNA methylation, increases expression and release of uPA and tPA, decreases neuritogenic ECM, and inhibits neuritogenesis/dendritic arborization in the developing hippocampus. Choline and SAM, by restoring DNMT activity, prevent the effects of ethanol on DNMT activity, uPA and tPA expression, ECM levels, and neuritogenesis/dendritic arborization. Aim 1 will characterize of the effects of ethanol treatments , with or without choline and SAM, and of DNMT inhibition in astrocytes on DNMT activity and expression, uPA and tPA expression, release, activity, promoter DNA methylation, and PC levels in astrocytes and on neuritogenesis. Aim 2 will investigate the effect of in vivo ethanol exposure from postnatal day (PD) 4 to PD 9 and choline treatments on hippocampal DNMT activity and expression, tPA and uPA expression and promoter DNA methylation, fibronectin and laminin protein levels, and dendritic arborization and spine density. These endpoints will be measured on PD 9 and on PD 30. The expression of fibronectin, laminin-1, tPA, uPA, and DNMT isoforms in astrocytes and neurons will be verified by immunohistochemistry. This study may unveil novel glia-mediated effects of ethanol on neuronal development and provide mechanisms by which choline protects hippocampal neuron development from the effects of ethanol by modulating astrocytic functions. 1',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Coronary heart disease is the single leading cause of death among men and women in the United States. Coronary revascularization, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the most common modality in patients with coronary diseases. However, it is also among the most costly, and is often associated with a high incidence of restenosis. Although the rate of restenosis is significantly reduced with the use of bare-metal stent (BMS) and particularly with drug-eluting stent (DES), a persistently high rate of restenosis after BMS and an increased risk of in-stent thrombosis with DES have been encountered as significant limitations to the long-term efficacy of coronary revascularization. With a long-term goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets for coronary heart disease, the current application specifically investigates a potentially critical role of calcium independent phospholipase A2b (iPLA2b) in vascular inflammation, re-endothelialization, and neointima formation in a mouse femoral artery wire injury model. iPLA2b is a member of the phospholipase A2 superfamily that acts on phospholipids to produce a free fatty acid and a lysophospholipid. iPLA2b is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and is implicated in many human diseases. Whereas little is known about the role of other PLA2 in vascular injury-induced neointima formation, substantial evidence, including pharmacological inhibition, antisense oligonucleotide down- rgulation, genetic deletion, and smooth muscle-specific overexpression, consistently demonstrated that iPLA2b plays a critical role in vascular inflammation and neointima formation in a mouse carotid artery ligation model. To investigate whether targeting smooth muscle-specific iPLA2b is sufficient to reduce vascular inflammation and neointima formation, a femoral artery injury model that better mimics PCI was established, a novel tamoxifen-inducible smooth muscle-specific iPLA2b knockout mouse model (SM-iPLA2b-iKO) was developed, and the current proposal hypothesizes that activation of iPLA2b in VSMC by vascular injury plays a key role in wire injury-induced vascular inflammation, re-endothelialization, and neointima formation, thereby significantly contributing to the development of restenosis after coronary revascularization. Three Specific Aims are:  1) To test the hypothesis that smooth muscle-specific iPLA2b plays a critical role in the initiation of vascular inflammation, re-endothelialization, and neointima formation; 2) To determine the molecular mechanism that underlies wire injury-induced iPLA2b activation, vascular inflammation, and neointima formation; 3) To investigate whether post-wire injury molecular and genetic targeting iPLA2b has an effect on the progression of re-endothelialization, vascular inflammation, and neointima formation. To achieve this goal, a well established and most physiological relevant femoral artery wire injury model will be used in combination with several novel and established genetic animal models (SM- iPLA2b-iKO, SM-HIF-1a-iKO, and SM-iPLA2b-Tg/12/15-LO) to selectively inhibit or activate iPLA2b, HIF-1a, and 12/15-LO before and after wire injury. Injured and non-injured femoral arteries will be isolated and then subjected to molecular, immunohistological, and biochemical studies to determine the role of iPLA2b in vascular inflammation and neointima formation. Results from the proposed studies may modify the current paradigm that the initiation and early progression of vascular inflammation are largely attributed to coordinated interactions among monocytes/macrophages, leukocytes, and endothelial cells by providing the first direct experimental evidence that VSMC also play a critical role in these early key events. Importantly, results from the proposed studies will elucidate specific mechanisms that could lead to the identification of iPLA2b as a novel potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of vascular inflammation, re- endothelialization, neointima formation, and restenosis.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cognitive impairment has been identified as a type 2 diabetes (T2D) complication. T2D has consistently been associated with increased risk for dementia and cognitive decline. Our recent studies suggest biological mechanisms through which this risk can be remedied. Diabetic persons treated with both insulin and other hypoglycemic medications, but not with either agent alone, have significantly less Alzheimer's Disease (AD) neuropathology than matched non- diabetic persons. The insulin receptor signaling pathway (IRSP) is a promising and biologically plausible mechanism by which the treatment of diabetes with combination therapy might affect the neurobiological substrates of cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly persons with and without diabetes. Studies examining the brain IRSP in diabetes and AD show that its functioning is significantly altered. This study will build on the experience of the JJ Peters VAMC and Mount Sinai School of Medicine Brain Bank and the neurobiology laboratories at the JJP-VAMC. Brain gene (Aim 1) and protein (Aim 2) expression studies of several key mediators and effectors in the IRSP (e.g., IR, IGF-1R, IRS1, IRS2, AKT1-3, GSK3?, FOXO1, and ?-Catenin), in postmortem brain specimens (superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus and occipital cortex), will compare diabetic subjects treated with combination therapy to matched diabetic subjects treated with insulin only, hypoglycemic medication only, and to non-diabetic subjects with and without AD-dementia. Relationships of expression alterations with cognitive-impairment-associated neuropathologies (A? and tau) will also be explored (Aim 3). To establish cause and effect relationships we will compare 8 groups of mice: combination therapy, insulin, metformin, or neither, in Tg2576 mice fed a high fat diet to induce insulin resistance (AD and T2D mouse models) or WT. Identifying brain molecular-biological pathways affected in diabetes and altered/restored by combination therapy is crucial to the translation of clinicopathological result to the development of treatment strategies for cognitive compromise in elderly Veterans with and without diabetes and to the promotion of their successful aging. The public health impact of this investigation to our Veterans is highlighted by the increasing prevalences of both diabetes and dementia, which are expected to dramatically accelerate as the proportion of elderly Veteran increases.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The sodium chloride co-transporter (NCC) and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) are two key sodium transporting proteins in the distal tubule of the mammalian kidney. Hyperactivity of either protein results in hypertension and hypoactivity results in hypotension. These two proteins are co-expressed in the second part of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2) and are regulated by many of the same proteins. However, associations between the two have not been investigated. Preliminary data indicates that the proteins associate in a sodium transporting complex and co-localize in the apical membrane of the DCT2. Investigating the relationship between ENaC and NCC in this key nephron segment has the potential to significantly alter our understanding of salt transport in the mammalian kidney. We now propose to examine the interaction of NCC with each subunit of ENaC, examine the functional implications of this interaction and investigate association-dependent alterations in regulation of these proteins by aldosterone.  Co-localization (in vivo and in vitro), native association, and proximity of NCC and each ENaC subunit will be examined. The ENaC subunit(s) that are critical for binding to NCC will also be determined. These studies will define the association between NCC and each ENaC subunit. Then the impact of this association on function, protein expression, surface expression and response to inhibitors of both sodium transporters will be investigated. These studies will determine the functional implications of this interaction. Then aldosterone-induced changes in function, protein expression and surface expression of NCC and ENaC will be examined in the absence or presence of the other. The aldosterone-induced phosphorylation of NCC with and without ENaC will also be investigated. Additionally the association of NEDD4-2 with NCC in the absence and presence of ENaC subunits will be determined. These studies will determine whether the NCC alters the regulation of ENaC by aldosterone and whether any of the ENaC subunits alter the regulation of NCC by aldosterone.  A variety of methods will be utilized to address these issues. Function of NCC will be assessed by thiazide-sensitive 22Na+ uptakes in mouse distal convoluted tubule cells (mDCT15). For measurement of ENaC function, Dr. Doug Eaton's lab will use single channel whole-cell patch clamping to assess ENaC function. The proximity of these proteins will be assessed utilizing Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Signal will be detected with confocal microscopy. Native association will be examined through the use of Blue Native PAGE. Electron Microscopy will be used to examine association under aldosterone stimulation. Lentiviral shRNA transduction particles will be used to knockdown protein expression in mDCT15 cells. Small animal surgeries with implantation of osmotic minipumps will be used to examine the effects of aldosterone on the NCC-ENaC association on the organismal level. Additionally standard methodologies such as immunoblotting, SDS-PAGE, biotinylation, transfection, co- immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry will be used.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Diabetes is an increasingly common disorder, recently estimated to affect 9.3% of the US population and 25.9% of individuals over 65 years of age (National Diabetes Statistics Report, June 2014). Because the VHA is a continuing system of care, all short- and long-term complications of diabetes are encountered in an expanding veteran group (Miller, 2004). Moreover, diabetes care in the VHA system is complex, since patients frequently have co-morbidities such as advancing age and post-traumatic stress disorder. Deleterious effects of diabetes on gastric function are highly prevalent and associated with considerable morbidity. However, the management of diabetic gastric complications remains unsatisfactory, despite an excellent record of adherence to accepted treatment guidelines, in part because mechanisms of gastric emptying abnormalities are so poorly understood. As a result, diagnosis of the underlying pathophysiology in individual cases is difficult, and since current treatment approaches are largely empirical rather than rationally designed, effective therapeutic options are often lacking. The study of the pathogenesis and treatment of gastric abnormalities in diabetes is complicated because: 1) symptoms may arise from either fast or slow gastric emptying; 2) gastric emptying is determined by the integrated response of independently regulated anatomic and functional regions of the stomach, so similar defects may result in either fast or slow gastric emptying depending on the region and/or cell type that is involved; and 3) different patterns of gastric motility regulate gastric emptying of solids and liquids during the digestive and inter-digestive periods; 4) finally, it is not entirely clear how best to use diabeti animal models in investigating diabetic gastroparesis. While many animal models of diabetes are available, it is unknown which of them most closely represents the features of human disease. Gastric emptying is regulated by distinct activities in gastric fundus, corpus/antrum and pylorus. Fast gastric emptying most often results from loss of inhibitory neurotransmission in the fundus, which is composed of tonic muscle and serves to store and accommodate ingested food by relaxing under the influence of inhibitory nerves. Slow gastric emptying often results from defective propulsive activity in the corpus/pylorus or defective relaxation of the pylorus. Defects in smooth muscle, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and neuromuscular neurotransmission have all been described in the stomach of diabetic animals, with loss of ICC and impaired nitrergic and cholinergic neurotransmission being the most consistent findings. However, we find that purinergic neurotransmission is also lost, suggesting that both vesicular and non-vesicular neurotransmission are impaired. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated changes in gastric emptying. In Aim 1, we will investigate the spectrum of neurotransmission deficits in different stomach regions of diabetic mice with predefined fast and slow gastric emptying. These studies will be performed in different animal models of diabetes to determine the degree to which these models share a common pathophysiology. These studies will define the pathogenesis of fast and slow gastric emptying, and generate reliable, reproducible data in disordered diabetic stomach. In Aim 2, we will systematically examine the hypothesis that dysfunction of the intracellular cargo motor, myosin 5a (myo5a), is an important cause of neurotransmitter deficit in diabetic stomach. This hypothesis is based on our studies showing myo5a dysfunction results in impaired release of multiple neurotransmitters. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that hyperglycemia leads to elevated myo5a O-GlcNAcylation, suppressing its activity and inhibiting neurotransmission, as well as enabling its premature degradation. Elucidation of the pathway involved in suppression of enteric neurotransmission may identify novel targets of therapy for diabetic stomach.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Diarrhea is a predominant symptom of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) or intestinal infections caused by food-borne pathogens. Our veteran patient population is particularly more vulnerable to diarrheal illnesses due to their age and numerous co-morbidities. In spite of significant medical advances, the treatment of diarrheal disorders still remains challenging. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of diarrhea associated with these diseases. Diarrhea results from increased intestinal secretion and/or decreased absorption of water and electrolytes. A major route of electrolyte absorption in the human intestine involves coupled operation of Na+/H+ (NHE) and Cl-/HCO3- exchangers. Studies have shown NHE3 to play a critical role in mediating intestinal sodium absorption as NHE3 knockout mice exhibit diarrheal phenotype. Also, it has been shown that NHE3 KO mice are more susceptible to inflammation as NHE3 deficiency in these mice resulted in diarrhea associated with colitis. To date, however, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in decreasing NHE3 expression in diarrheal disorders. In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the down-regulation of NHE3 expression in IBD-related diarrhea, our current studies are focused on the role of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications shown to be implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. Our extensive preliminary data provides strong evidence for the epigenetic regulation of NHE3 expression by changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications. Based on these data, we hypothesize that changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications and chromatin remodeling play important roles in modulating NHE3 gene expression that underlie the pathophysiology of diarrhea. The current application is, therefore, designed to investigate the regulation of NHE3 gene expression by DNA methylation and histone modifications utilizing both in vitro (Aims 1 & 2) and in vivo models (Aim 3) as follows: Aim 1. Elucidate in detail the effect of DNA methylation on NHE3 promoter activity, identify the specific CpG dinucleotide involved in the modulation of NHE3 promoter and determine the roles of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) isoforms; Aim 2: Investigate the role of histone acetyl transferase, p300 & histone deacetylase (HDAC) isoforms in the modulation of NHE3 expression, changes in histone acetylation marks on NHE3 gene and chromatin remodeling in the stimulation of NHE3 expression; and Aim 3: Examine the regulation of NHE3 expression by epigenetic mechanisms under normal and inflammatory conditions utilizing wild type, DSS-induced colitis and NHE3 knockout mice (diarrheal phenotype). The outcome of these studies should provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of NHE3 and define important mechanistic link between alterations in DNA methylation/histone modifications of NHE3 gene and diarrhea associated with IBD. Also, these studies will establish for the first time the identity of a particular DNMT or HDAC isoforms involved in the dysregulation of NHE3 in diarrheal disorders.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The recent breakthrough in hypertension research reveals that a novel WNK kinase family [(with-no- lysine (K)] and its two key down-stream substrates SPAK (Ste20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase) and its homolog OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) are evolutionarily conserved regulators of ion transporters by altering their net phosphorylation state and play an important role in renal salt handling and in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) transports 1Na+, 1K+, and 2Cl- ions into cells and is important in regulation of intracellular Na+ and Cl-, cell volume, and K+ uptake in the central nervous system (CNS) under physiological conditions. Previous studies from our lab and others' clearly indicate that over-stimulation of NKCC1 activity contributes to cerebral ischemic damage. Under ischemic conditions, NKCC1 activation causes intracellular Na+ and Cl- overload in astrocytes and neurons. The intracellular Na+ overload subsequently stimulates the reverse mode operation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange and leads to a delayed, secondary cytosolic Ca2+ rise and Ca2+ dysregulation in ER and mitochondria. Most importantly, either pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of NKCC1 shows significant neuroprotective effects in in vivo focal ischemia model (middle cerebral artery occlusion, MCAO) and in vitro ischemia model. Despite of the neuroprotective effects in ischemic brain damage by blocking NKCC1 activity, it remains unknown how NKCC1 protein is stimulated in ischemic brains and what are the up-stream regulatory mechanisms.  Our pilot study revealed robust stimulation of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling pathway in ischemic brains. The goal of this project is to investigate whether the cerebral WNK3-SPAK-NKCC1 signaling pathway contributes to ischemic brain damage and whether blocking the WNK3/SPAK kinases with a newly discovered WNK-SPAK pathway inhibitor STOCK1S-50699 or transgenic knockout of WNK3 (WNK3 KO), or SPAK (SPAK KO) is neuroprotective. Our preliminary study shows that WNK3 KO mice exhibited significantly reduced infarct volume, less axonal demyelination, and accelerated neurobehavioral recovery. New data in this resubmission illustrates a ~70% reduction in infarct volume in SPAK KO mice. These data provide fresh insight into the role of ion transporters and their regulatory kinases in ischemic neuroglial injury. Completion of this project will help us to determine whether the WNK3-SPAK kinase complex presents a compelling target for novel neuroprotective strategies for ischemic brain injury. Our study will pave a foundation for developing new WNK-SPAK inhibitors for ischemic brain damage therapy.\",\n",
       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by profound impairment in memory and other cognitive skills that make it difficult for patients to complete instrumental activities of daily lving (IADL) and live independently. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) describes a condition in which an older adult shows poor memory, but is generally able to perform IADLs. Executive functioning (EF) refers to the ability to plan, reason, solve problems, and multi-task, and is dependent upon fronto-parietal networks. Functional imaging studies have documented increases in prefrontal cortex activity in MCI, and paradoxical increases in the connectivity between memory networks and fronto-parietal regions. We hypothesize that MCI is characterized by reorganization of frontally-mediated networks to compensate for AD pathology. Using EF as a means of defining fronto-parietal networks, the work proposed here investigates the structural and functional connectivity of prefrontal networks in MCI and AD. In aim 1, we will investigate if increases in brain activity in fronto-parietal networks reflect impaired structural connectivity within the network. In aim 2 we will explore how increases and decreases to the functional connectivity of frontally based networks predict IADLs in MCI and AD, respectively.  We will enroll 55 patients with MCI, 55 patients with AD, and 55 age matched elderly controls (EC). All participants will complete a comprehensive clinical assessment and undergo MRI scanning on a 3T magnet. Our first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that in MCI, declines to the structural connectivity of fronto- parietal networks will correlate with increases in brain activity in this network. This would support the theory that declines in network structural connectivity induce changes in functional activity to preserve cognition. Toward this aim, MCI and EC will complete cognitive fMRI tasks of EF and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We will use DTI tractography to create the white matter tracts that connect the fronto-parietal networks involved in the tasks. We will extract mean fractional anisotropy values (FA) from these tracts to interrogate their integrity. We will correlate FA with fMRI brain activity to understand how changes to structural connectivity impact the network's functioning. Our second aim will test the hypothesis that there will be increased functional connectivity in frontally mediated networks in MCI, but reduced functional connectivity in AD. Moreover, in MCI, increased functional connectivity will correlate with poorer EF and IADLs. This finding would support the theory that in MCI, increases in functional connectivity reflect reorganization of frontal networks as a compensatory mechanism. In order to test these hypotheses, we will first identify frontal-parietal networks engaged during EF fMRI tasks in MCI and EC. Next, MCI, EC, and AD will complete resting state fMRI (rsfMRI). We will compare the functional connectivity of frontally based networks between groups and explore how functional connectivity is associated with clinical symptoms.  The results of both aims would support the theory that MCI is a dynamic state characterized by increases and decreases to the connectivity of neural networks. The seemingly paradoxical increases in brain activity and functional connectivity of frontal-based networks may be an attempt to compensate for accumulating AD pathology in memory networks. AD diagnosis and impaired IADLs may occur when the structural connectivity of fronto-parietal networks can no longer support compensatory functional activity (aim 1), and functional connections can no longer offset impairing symptoms (aim 2). This work will provide new insight into brain re-organization in MCI. It will support the integration of a nonlinear trajectory of brain changes int neuroimaging models of AD disease progression, lead to the development of disease resilience biomarkers, and begin to characterize new targets for treatment focused on supporting compensation.\",\n",

PROJECT DESCRIPTION Abstract: Despite recent advances in therapeutics, colorectal cancer remains the third deadliest cancer in the USA. This is mainly attributable to survival of a small population of cancer cells called stem cells (CSCs), which display dysregulated self-renewal, aberrant differentiation at the cellular level, and resistance to most cancer chemotherapies preventing complete cure of cancer. Others and we have shown that inhibition of IGF-1R- AKT-mTOR (InAT) axis is a promising approach to target this resistant population within the tumors. However, this promise has not lived up to the high expectations. We have uncovered a novel, critical and clinically relevant mechanism of IGF-1R inhibition's effect on CSCs that involves downregulation of mevalonate- isoprenoid biosynthesis (MIB) pathway, a precursor pathway of steroid synthesis, at levels distal to that targeted by statins, th widely used anti-cholesterol drugs. Inhibition of MIB pathway results in depletion of several bioactive terpenes that are involved in critical biological processes such as protein prenylation and N- Glycosylation, which in turn regulates ÃŸ-catenin signaling, a critical pathway governing colonic CSCs growth. We hypothesize that that a combination strategy employing simultaneous inhibition of InAT axis and MIB pathway, with FDA-approved agents or those that are in advanced clinical development, will results in synergistic downregulation of MIB pathway, ÃŸ-catenin signaling, and CSCs growth. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. In vitro and in vivo models of CSCs as well as utilizing primary human colon cancer samples, we will establish significance of InAT axis and MIB pathway upregulation on CSCs growth (Aim 1). Subsequently, we will determine optimal therapeutic combination(s) of select agents from targeting InAT axis combined with those that suppress MIB pathway by employing sequential strategy of in vitro screening of the proposed drug combination in 10 selected colon cancer cell lines, with diverse genetic changes representing sporadic CRC, to identify highly synergistic combinations that will be advanced in animal models of CSCs growth (Aim 2). Moreover, we will examine detailed molecular mechanisms of inhibition of InAT axis (alone or in combination with a MIB pathway inhibitor, also 'optimum anti-CSCs combination(s)') on MIB pathway downregulation as well as CSCs growth by employing advanced biophysical and biochemical studies to a) determine levels of mevalonate pathway metabolites, b) determine the role of InAT-SREBP axis in regulating gene specific transcription of MIB pathway enzymes, and c) examining the role of downstream terpene molecules (which regulate prenylation and N-glycosylation) in regulating ÃŸ-catenin/TCF-4 signaling (Aim 3). The results from the proposed experiments would greatly expand our understanding of mechanisms of colon CSCs growth and identify 'optimum anti-CSCs combination(s)' therapy that will be immediately testable in the clinical trial(s), and will have paradigm-shifting implications in the treatment of colorectal cancr. 1\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Obesity-associated type-2 diabetes and its comorbidities, atherosclerosis and stroke, are all too common diseases in the aging population of our Veterans. These illnesses are invariably linked to aberrant lipid homeostasis as manifested by excessive synthesis and high circulating levels of very low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides. The long-term objective of our studies is to gain molecular insights into the mechanisms of hepatic lipid homeostasis and dyslipidemia and their cardiovascular complications. As a transcription factor that regulates key genes involved de novo lipid synthesis in the liver, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) is a central player in these processes. Nascent pSREBP-1c resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and must be transported to the Golgi where it undergoes regulated intra- membrane proteolysis (RIP) to release its transcriptionally active nuclear domain, nSREBP-1c that activates its own promoter. This feed-forward regulation SREBP-1c in the liver by insulin is a key mechanism of selective insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia and their clinical consequences. Based on compelling published data and our ongoing studies we hypothesize that phosphorylation via insulin-induced kinase PI3K-Akt/PKB, and its downstream kinases mTOR and p70S6K, regulate the RIP-mediated maturation, and trans-activation potency and stability of nSREBP-1c in the nucleus. Additionally, via crosstalk with insulin signaling kinases, MAP kinases also impinge on the feed-forward regulation of SREBP-1c in chronically obese rodents and man. With a goal to experimentally test this hypothesis, we have site-specifically mutated seventeen, AKT/mTOR/S6K and MAPK specific putative phosphorylation sites, selected on the basis of published observations and our theoretical analyses. Based on a rigorous assessment of the phenotypes of WT and mutated SREBP-1c in a McArdle hepatoma cell line and primary rat hepatocytes, we have selected FOUR sites [mTOR (S57 and S140), p70S6K (S956) and MAP kinase (S39)] for detailed examination of their role in the feed-forward regulation of SREBP-1c. The short-term goals of our proposal are (i) to identify sequence motifs of SREBP-1c involved in insulin-enhanced, phosphorylation- dependent regulation of RIP and trans-activation ability of nSREBP-1c in vitro and in vivo and (ii) to decipher how phosphorylation alters the molecular interactions of SREBP-1c during its ER to Golgi transit and proteolysis by S1P and S2P proteases, and (iii) to elucidate how phosphorylation alters the stability and transcriptional function of nSREBP-1c in the nucleus, in vitro and in vivo. To accomplish these goals, we will express wild type, and gain- or loss-of-phosphorylation mutants of tagged pSREBP-1c and nSREBP-1c proteins in rat hepatocytes in culture, and in livers of normal and obese and hyper-insulinemic MC4R knockout, rats, using our unique custom-designed adenovirus and plasmid vectors. We will compare the rates of RIP-mediated maturation of WT and mutated nSREBP-1c proteins and their trans-activation potential in the presence and absence of insulin. We will determine if/how phosphorylation alters the molecular interactions between full-length SREBP-1c and other molecules that are involved in ER-to-Golgi transit and proteolysis. Additionally, we will elucidate how phosphorylation alters the trans-activation potential of nSREBP-1c to activate its own promoter and the promoters of downstream target genes that regulate hepatic lipid synthesis. Our Specific Aims are designed to shed mechanistic light on phosphorylation-dependent actions of SREBP-1c on lipid homeostasis in vitro and in vivo. A successful completion of these studies has the potential to unravel novel therapeutic targets to treat chronic obesity and its pathological consequences for the cardiovascular system.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Clefting of the lip and/or palate (CL/P) is the most common facial birth defect. This disruption of normal facial structure can lead to difficulties wit necessary functions such as breathing, feeding, and speech development. Clinical manifestations of CL/P are highly variable, indicating that the disorder is likely caused by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. There is currently great interest in identifying the environmental factors that interact with genetic susceptibility to effect clinical presentation of CL/P, as further understanding of these factors could lead to important new treatments and interventions. Maternal nutrition is both a known influence on craniofacial development and an ideal target for future interventions. This project will investigate how genotype and vitamin A levels in the maternal diet interact to influence midfacial development and CL/P susceptibility and severity. In the first aim of this project, a mouse model allowing precise control over bioavailable levels of vitamin A will be used to assess the impact of mild and moderate maternal vitamin A deficiency (VAD) on facial phenotype. Using deformable morphology analysis, difference in phenotypes will be quantified and are expected to reveal a graded degree of change in facial morphology corresponding to the degree of maternal VAD. The second aim of this project will use mouse models allowing dietary control of vitamin A and/or CL/P sensitivity to investigate the impact of mild and moderate maternal VAD and maternal vitamin A supplementation on CL/P severity and frequency. Severity of phenotypes will be quantified using deformable morphology methods. The results are expected to show an increase in cleft severity and frequency corresponding to the degree of maternal VAD and a protective effect associated with vitamin A supplementation. This work will further the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and environmental modulators contributing to CL/P susceptibility and sensitivity which will help identify optimal treatment and preventative strategies.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Project Summary Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the common cause of kidney failure. Elucidating mechanisms that mediate the early stage of DKD may help to identify novel preventive and therapeutic measures for patients with DKD. In the previous funding period, we demonstrated a critical role of NF-?B and STAT3 acetylation in DKD through the regulation of inflammatory gene expression (see progress report). To further understand the mechanism of early DKD injury, we performed proteomic studies in the glomeruli of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and identified protein S (PS) as one of the proteins which were highly regulated in early DKD. PS, coded by Pros1, is a cofactor for the formation of activated protein C (APC). APC formation has been shown to protect glomerular cells from apoptosis in DKD. In addition, PS shares structural similarities with GAS6, which is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of kidney disease. Both PS and GAS6 bind to TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer), which belong to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that mediates regulation of inflammation as well as cell survival and migration. However, PS and GAS6 have different binding affinity to individual TAM receptors and appear to have different functions. The role of PS and TAM receptors in kidney disease is not known. Our preliminary data suggest that PS expression increased in the glomeruli of diabetic rats and in human kidneys with early DKD, but decreased in those with advanced DKD. Plasma concentrations of PS were not different between diabetic and non-diabetic rats or humans, suggesting a local regulation of PS expression. We found that knockdown of PS in podocytes enhanced high glucose-induced apoptosis while overexpression of PS inhibited TNF-?-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression, suggesting a protective role of PS against diabetes-induced podocyte injury. We found that Tyro3, one of the TMA receptors, was upregulated by high glucose and knockdown of Tyro3 expression abolished the protective effects of PS in podocytes. Tyro3 expression is also upregulated in human glomeruli at early DKD but downregulated at late DKD. We developed podocyte-specific Pros1 knockout mice (KO) and found that diabetic KO mice developed more proteinuria, mesangial expansion, and foot process effacement than diabetic wild-type mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PS may protect glomerular cell injury in early DKD through the formation of APC and/or effects mediated by Tyro3. We will test our hypothesis by two aims: In the aim 1, we will determine the factors which upregulate PS and Tyro3 at early DKD and those suppress PS and Tyro3 at late DKD and the effects of PS and Tyro3 in podocytes cultured in diabetic condition. In the aim 2 we will determine the role of PS and Tyro3 in DKD progression in vivo using both conditional overexpression and knockout mouse models for PS and Tyro3. We believe that the proposed studies could help us to elucidate the mechanism of glomerular cell injury in early DKD and therefore we could develop more effective drugs to prevent the progression of DKD.',\n",
       " 'Several different, seemingly unrelated processes can cause Parkinson?s disease (PD). For examples, genetic mutations that affect ?-synuclein expression, proteasome function, and mitochondrial quality control each produce a disease phenotype indistinguishable from toxin-induced and ?idiopathic? PD. A fundamental question is whether these disparate processes act through independent mechanisms to produce the same disease phenotype, or whether instead these processes converge to a shared pathogenic process. The question is important because identification of a shared pathogenic process could provide an approach for slowing the progression of idiopathic PD. Here we propose that neuronal glutathione is a critical nexus linking these processes, by virtue of its roles in both protein folding / repair and rapid scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We will test the hypothesis that ?-synuclein overexpression (or aggregation) causes neuronal glutathione depletion and resultant neurodegeneration by facilitating metal-catalyzed ROS production. The studies will use genetic and pharmacological approaches in mouse and cell culture models of PD. The Thy-1 ?-synuclein mouse, which exhibits several features of PD, will be crossed with mice having genetically reduced neuronal glutathione levels. The progeny and founder stains will be evaluated at serial time points with measures of motor function, neuronal glutathione content, oxidative stress, and ?-synuclein aggregation. We will also use these mice stains to evaluate a pharmacological approach for augmenting neuronal glutathione levels and slowing disease progression. The pharmacological studies will provide a complementary test of the underlying hypotheses, and will additionally provide preclinical efficacy data. Cerebrospinal fluid from the treated mice will be collected for a metabolomics assessment of potential treatment biomarkers. In parallel with these in vivo studies, we will use a cell culture system to more directly evaluate processes by which ?- synuclein overexpression or aggregation may promote ROS production and glutathione consumption. These processes include ?-synuclein interactions with dopamine, pre-formed ?-synuclein fibrils, and protein chaperones. Central to these studies is the concept that ?-synuclein or ?-synuclein aggregates can promote ROS production through association with transition metals. The studies will employ a dopaminergic SH-SY5 neuroblastoma line in which ?-synuclein expression can be titrated in response to a chemical signal (doxycycline)and, where feasible, cultured midbrain neurons from wild-type and ?- synuclein overexpressing mice.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common liver disease among veterans and is characterized by hepatic steatosis, sterile inflammation and liver damage [1]. NASH is associated with the metabolic syndrome, and can progress to cirrhosis and cancer. The mechanisms governing NASH development are not known, and currently there is no effective therapy. We have shown that the DNA receptor TLR9 (TOLL like receptor 9) is required for acute sterile inflammation in the liver and pancreas [2-4]. Here we propose to examine role of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in TLR9 activation and its importance in murine and human NASH. Our hypothesis is that increased levels of mitochondrial DNA from hepatocytes contributes to the development of NASH via TLR9 activation on Kupffer cells, monocytes and hepatocytes.  We will focus on identifying the cellular source and biochemical (oxidation) status of cfDNA, and the functional role of cfDNA in NASH. Our data will support the progression to clinical trials of a TLR9 antagonist that has already been safely used in humans. Preliminary data: i) Plasma levels of cfDNA are higher in mice fed a HFD and in obese patients with NASH, and the cfDNA is of mitochondrial origin. ii) Plasma from NASH subjects has an increase in intact mitochondria (mt), and the majority are in microparticles (MP). iii) Plasma DNA from mice with NASH is a potent ligand for TLR9. iv) Increased ability of plasma from NASH patients to activate a TLR9 reporter cell line is significantly reduced when MP are removed. v) Increase in oxidation state of mtDNA in plasma from patients with NASH. vi) Total body deletion of TLR9 results in less NASH in a HFD model of NASH. vii) Selective deletion of TLR9 on macrophages results in less NASH. viii) Hepatocytes mtDNA from mice fed a HFD has a greater degree of oxidation and a greater ability to stimulate inflammatory, but not anti-inflammatory pathway. ix) The TLR9 antagonist IRS954 protects mice against NASH. Aim 1: Identify the cellular origin and biochemical characteristics of DNA responsible for TLR9 activation in NASH. Aim 2: Identify the cell specific effects of TLR9 activation on a) monocytes and Kupffer cells and b) hepatocytes. Aim 3: Identify the role of mtDNA oxidation on the selective activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, and test a clinically available TLR9 antagonist in a mouse model of NASH. This grant will identify the cellular origins of the elevated the TLR9 ligand plasma cfDNA in NASH, and identify if the development of NASH increases the ability of DNA to function as a ligand for TLR9. It will further establish the role of TLR9 activation on KC, monocytes, and hepatocytes in the development of HFD NASH. Finally demonstration of the efficacy of a clinically available TLR9 antagonist in a mouse model of NASH will allow for the rational progression to clinical trials.',\n",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Mortality from chronic infectious diseases, including Hepatitis C, HIV, and tuberculosis, remains a major problem among Veterans, making the development of new vaccines an important priority of biomedical research. Immunologic memory is a cardinal feature of adaptive immunity and an important goal of vaccination strategies. Traditional vaccination strategies are very effective at generating neutralizing antibodies against bacteria and viruses. However, a vaccine capable of generating robust T cell memory is still beyond our research, due, in part, to an incomplete understanding of the molecular basis for memory lymphocyte fate specification. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying immune `exhaustion,' a state in which T cells are rendered ineffective during many chronic viral infections, remain incompletely understood. Thus, a fundamental understanding of how memory lymphocyte fate is specified, as well as what goes awry in the exhausted state, is a crucial first step in rational vaccine design for infectious diseases such as HIV, HCV, malaria, and tuberculosis. Our underlying hypothesis is that previously unappreciated molecular determinants control the specification of terminal effector and memory (TCM, TEM, and TRM) cell fates as well as the exhausted CD8+ T cell state. Our goal is to identify and validate these determinants using innovative multi-disciplinary approaches that include single-cell RNA sequencing, computational analyses, and immunological techniques.\",\n",
       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Depression is among the most common, disabling, and expensive disorders afflicting our nation's veterans. Cellular and molecular studies of circadian (ca. 24 hr) biological clocks have recently provided tantalizing clues that clock defects may be involved not just in sleep disorders but in a wide range of clinical maladies, including mood disorders. Objectives: Our long-term goal is to define the precise relationship between genetically determined cellular circadian clock function and human mood dysregulation. Our overall hypothesis is that normal mood regulation requires proper circadian timing within brain circuits, and that mood disorders are therefore associated with dysfunction of the circadian clock at a cellular level. We hypothesize that vulnerability to mood disorders arises from clock defects not in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's master circadian pacemaker, but rather in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in mood regulation that contains a separate circadian clock. Our specific hypotheses are that: (1) circadian clocks are weak in human cells from depressed patients, (2) circadian clocks are also weak in NAc neurons in a mouse model of depression, and (3) weak circadian clocks in the NAc can increase vulnerability to depression in mice by removing normal daily cyclic repression of the CREB signaling pathway by the clock protein CRY. Specifically, we aim to test for circadian dysfunction in skin cells from depressed patients and in neurons from mice exhibiting depression-like behavior. We will then test whether manipulating the circadian clock or CREB signaling in NAc cells of mice alters their vulnerability to depression-like behavior. Research Design & Methodology: We will use viral vectors to introduce a firefly luciferase circadian reporter gene into human skin cells obtained by our collaborators. We will then monitor circadian rhythms of cell bioluminescence by luminometry and single-cell imaging, and analyze comprehensively the functioning of the clock, as well as expression levels of core clock genes. Next, we will use behaviorally induced learned helplessness as a mouse model of depression. Mice will harbor a bioluminescent circadian reporter, allowing us to test circadian clock function in NAc neuronal cells as we did in human cells. We will also measure levels of core clock gene expression and CREB activity in NAc brain slices, expecting to find low Cry expression and high P-CREB. Finally, we will manipulate clock or CREB function in mouse NAc by injection of various inhibitory RNAs or CREB constructs, respectively, followed by testing vulnerability to induced learned helplessness. We expect that weakening NAc rhythms by Cry knockdown, but not by knockdown of a different clock gene, will increase vulnerability to learned helplessness, and that selectively reducing CREB function at dawn, by properly phased rhythmic expression of a dominant-negative CREB construct, will be optimal for reducing vulnerability. Clinical Relationships: Our goal is an improved understanding of the relationship between neuronal circadian clocks and depression. This project may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to mood disorders, which are major afflictions and sources of disability for veterans.\",\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Veterans suffer at a disproportional rate from squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) due to carcinogen exposure from tobacco and alcohol. Despite aggressive treatments, SCCHN is a devastating disease that portends an overall 5-year survival of only ~50%. A comprehensive genomic analysis of SCCHN revealed that ~30% of these tumors overexpress a gene that encodes a calcium-activated chloride channel (TMEM16A/ ANO1). Mechanistic studies have shown that TMEM16A contributes to tumor cell growth by activating the EGFR-ERK1/2 pathway. EGFR is the only FDA-approved molecular therapeutic target in SCCHN, yet the critical therapeutic biomarker(s) that predict response to anti-EGFR therapy remains unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the how TMEM16A and EGFR interact with each other to promote tumor growth and progression. We propose the following studies: 1) determine whether chloride flux through TMEM16A is necessary and sufficient to activate EGFR signaling; 2) examine how TMEM16A interacts with EGFR, and if this interaction is necessary for tumor cell growth; and 3) use a patient samples and tissues derived from a mouse model of carcinogenesis to determine if TMEM16A expression / TMEM16A-EGFR interaction is required for the development of oral dysplasia and ultimately progression to invasive carcinoma. At the conclusion of this project, we intend to implicate TMEM16A as a direct therapeutic target for the treatment of Veterans with OSCC.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Lung cancer is a smoking-related disease and the No. 1 cancer killer in Veterans. The early detection of lung cancer by CT scan significantly reduces the mortality. CT scan is now recommended for lung cancer screening in smokers. However, CT scan dramatically increases the number of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs) in asymptomatic Veterans, whereas only a small fraction of PNs are lung tumors. Given the large number of referrals to unnecessary and harmful procedures for smokers with indeterminate PNs, there is an urgent need for biomarkers that can rule out lung cancer in Veterans with PNs by specifically diagnosing the disease. We have previously developed sputum-based small non-coding RNA (ncRNA) biomarkers for diagnosis of lung cancer. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the sputum assay with only 2-3 biomarkers are not sufficient, and need to be improved by identifying and including new biomarkers. The objective of this application is to identify new lung cancer-associated small ncRNAs and develop them as sputum biomarkers that can sufficiently exclude lung cancer in Veterans with PNs. To achieve the objective, we will define a small ncRNA profile of bronchial epithelial cells of lung cancer patients, and then optimize a panel of sputum biomarkers for lung cancer using our existing sputum samples. We will also validate the performance of the new biomarker panel in newly and prospectively collected sputum specimens. The success of the project will produce a useful tool that can complement CT screening for lung cancer by ruling out lung cancer in a CT screening positive setting, and hence reduce lung cancer-related mortality in Veterans.',\n",

Therefore, understanding the etiological basis for the risk of suicide is of dire importance to our Veteran population. Stress i a crucial factor in risk of suicide. Specifically for Veterans, exposure to traumatic environmental events during combat, military service, or post- deployment stressful situations related to readjustment to civilian life are key contributors to the increase risk of suicide. These stressors  can affect the diathesis for suicidal acts and can serve as triggers or precipitants of suicidal acts. Biological markers or stable behavioral traits for suicide risk factors likely interact in a complex manner that might benefit from approaches that can examine gene by environment interactions. Epigenetics is the bridge, connecting environment with genetics, by mediating the influence of environmental factors such as stress in altered regulation of gene expression related to suicide. We will investigate DNA methylation patterns associated with suicide risk in Veterans undergoing psychiatric treatment at the JJP VAMC using a genome- scale approach. Additionally, through subsequent follow-up studies, we will assess how DNA methylation patterns are altered following treatment. Such a longitudinal study is unprecedented and provides an opportunity to identify biological markers of suicide risk and treatment response. Moreover, the role of the inflammatory response in the stress diathesis in suicide risk will also be investigated in these studies. Together the epigenetic and inflammatory markers of suicide risk and treatment will identify objective measures that we can use in clinical settings to identif Veterans at risk of suicide and to determine the efficacy of treatment course and response.',\n",
       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Diabetes and its complications are a significant burden on the healthcare system in the United States with nearly $250 billion spent on the care of these patients in 2012. This is even more significant in the VA Healthcare System where the incidence of diabetes is three times as high. Diabetic patients are prone to develop foot and leg ulcers resulting from neuropathy, susceptibility to infection, and microvascular disease. Unfortunately, diabetics have a significantly impaired ability to heal these ulcers and often go on to minor or major limb amputations. These events lead to loss of productivity and associated morbidity and mortality. One of the deficits associated with impaired wound healing in diabetic patients is the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and insufficient nitric oxide (NO) production. It has been demonstrated that reduction of ROS or delivery of NO to diabetic wounds can improve healing rates and reduce infection. However, NO delivery is hampered by the short half-life of the molecule and its highly reactive state. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is an enzyme known for its ability to produce ROSs and we identified that it is highly expressed in skin and wounds. XOR has attracted a great deal of attention in the past few years because it can convert the stable compound nitrite back to NO. XOR has been shown to utilize dietary nitrite to mediate the beneficial effects of NO in a variety of disease models. In the wound, preliminary data indicate that XOR plays an essential role in normal wound repair but its role in diabetic wounds remains uncertain. The systemic inhibition of XOR in diabetes appears to improve wound healing while local inhibition further delays healing. In addition, the administration of systemic or topical nitite also improves wound repair. An attractive property of XOR is that it favors the production of NO when nitrite is provided in the setting of hypoxia. When producing NO, XOR mediated ROS production is reduced. These properties are extremely favorable in the setting of chronic wounds where vascularity is diminished with resulting ischemia. In such a setting, administering nitrite may not only induce XOR to generate NO but it may also reduce ROS production. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the precise role of XOR and its products in the diabetic wound repair process. Studies will examine the function of XOR generated NO and ROS in diabetic wounds. The role of XOR in wound neovascularization will be examined to define the importance of the source of the XOR function. These studies will be aided by the use of endothelial cell specific XOR knockout mice. The proposal will culminate in examination of human wounds of different etiologies to quantify XOR activity, the ability to augment local NO production through nitrite supplementation, and the impact of other nitrite reductases in this NO production. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish the foundation for developing topical nitrite as a treatment for impaired diabetic wound healing. The extremely attractive aspect of such a therapy is its simplicity, low cost, and the ability to harness the body's own machinery to produce the therapeutic agent. If effective, topical nitrite therapy may also be applied to wounds of other etiologies such as venous stasis and ischemic wounds.\",\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world, and it affects more than 285,000 U.S. veterans. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is associated with both development and progression of primary open angle glaucoma, and IOP is the only modifiable risk factor for the disease. However, the mechanisms causing elevated IOP remain poorly understood. Trabecular meshwork cells are critical to maintaining a normal aqueous fluid flow and intraocular pressure. In other tissues such as the kidney, bones and cartilage, the primary cilia play a mechanosensory role in fluid flow. Here, we further explore the potential for cilia of trabecular meshwork cells to serve a mechanosensory role in the eye. Indeed, our previous findings demonstrate that phosphoinositide lipids within primary cilium are an important regulator of eye pressure. In the primary cilium, inositol phosphatase OCRL interacts with TRPV4, a mechanosensory channel that lowers IOP in mice when TRPV4 is stimulated. Previous studies have established that phosphoinositides regulate TRPV4 activity. We hypothesize that phosphoinositide signaling within the cilia of the trabecular meshwork cells regulates aqueous outflow via TRPV4 channels. In this application, we propose to employ novel optogenetic techniques to selectively direct protein translocation and activation of ciliary inositl kinase/phosphatase to modulate TRPV4 activity and IOP. In Aim 1, we will determine whether alterations in PIP2 dephosphorylation via OCRL affect ciliary outflow facility and IOP in mice by optogenetic stimulation of inositol phosphatase OCRL. We will then assess whether optical stimulation of ectopically expressed OCRL can rescue a steroid-induced glaucoma (SIG) mouse model. We expect that the activation of TRPV4 channels via light-responsive OCRL in the anterior chamber of mouse eye will lower IOP. In Aim 2, we will determine whether PIP2 phosphorylation via PI3K activation will affect ciliary outflow facility and IOP in wild-type mice.  We anticipate that optogenetic stimulation of PI3K signaling will increase IOP and reduce outflow facility. We will then determine whether small molecule inhibition of PI3K decreases IOP in the steroid-induced glaucoma mouse model. In Aim 3, we will determine whether steroid-induced glaucoma patients exhibit changes in their trabecular meshwork cell membrane phosphoinositide content. We will also compare phosphoinositide levels in cultured trabecular meshwork cells from patients undergoing trabeculectomy surgery to normal aged- matched cadaveric controls. The proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on the understanding of mechanosensation of eye pressure in mammals, thereby facilitating the discovery of new therapies for open angle glaucoma and other forms of glaucoma. Ultimately, the knowledge obtained from this study may allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies in glaucoma that will benefit our veterans.',\n",
       " 'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that manifests predominantly as a destructive synovitis. In spite of the prominence of the synovial inflammation, many immunological abnormalities are systemic. Autoantibodies are not tissue-specific and are directed against global antigens such as Ig Fc determinants and neoantigens of citrullinated peptides. T cell abnormalities in RA are already detectable in naÃ¯ve T cells. NaÃ¯ve T cells from RA patients have a lowered signaling threshold of the T cell receptor which may explain why failure in immune tolerance to neoantigens such as citrullinated peptides is the immunological hallmark of RA. They have defects in DNA repair mechanisms which predisposes for increased apoptosis susceptibility and accelerated immunosenescence. And they have rewired their metabolic network shunting glucose preferentially into the pentose phosphate pathway to reduce oxidative stress and produce metabolites necessary for synthetic activities. This application aims at gaining a deeper understanding of T cell dysfunction in RA by characterizing their epigenetic landscape. We will use a recently developed platform, assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC)-sequencing that allows genome-wide mapping of the open chromatin within small populations of isolated T cells including antigen- specific T cells. [Three aims are proposed. The objective of Aim 1 is to identify RA-associated epigenetic signatures in naÃ¯ve T cells by comparing patients with RA, psoriatic arthritis and age-matched controls and relate them to the signatures in memory T cells and autoantigen-specific T cells. Aim 2 will explore the influence of disease activity and treatment on these signatures. By examining transcription factor (TF) target sequences at accessible sites, we will define transcription factor networks that are associated with RA and/or related to cytokine exposure in peripheral blood or the synovial tissue. In Aim 3, we will explore the functional consequences of differential chromatin accessibility by comparing open sites to the transcriptome of T cell subsets before and after activation. In addition, we will determine the relationship of open sites to eQTLs and to causal SNPs implicated in RA. These studies will provide a comprehensive map of promoter and enhancer accessibilities in RA T cells that may determine the transcriptome at resting stage as well as their ability to respond and develop into autoantigen-specific effector T cells.]',\n",

However, the mechanisms that regulate MPC differentiation are poorly understood. This proposal is based on the hypothesis that MPCs serve to sense metabolic stress which then directs their differentiation. In this view, the control of adipogenic vs. osteogenic differentiation of MPCs is a mechanism for balancing structural/biomechanical and metabolic needs. Excessive marrow adipogenesis is associated with bone loss and metabolic adaptation whereas excessive osteoblast differentiation favors acquisition of bone mass possibly at the cost of reduced capacity for metabolic adaptation. Conditions of high metabolic stress, such as diet- induced obesity, drive adipogenic differentiation in preference to osteoblast differentiation. We propose that G protein signaling is a key participant in metabolic sensing in MPCs, with the inhibitory G protein (Gi) signaling pathway promoting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that drives increased marrow adipogenesis and bone loss. These concepts will be tested in three specifics aims. In specific aims 1 and 2, we will utilize mouse genetic models to effect constitutive Gi signaling (Aim 1) or blockade of Gi signaling (Aim 2) in MPCs. We will investigate the effect of these manipulations on bone marrow adipose tissue, bone mass, fracture repair, and adaption to metabolic stress (high fat diet). In specific aim 3, we will use cellular and molecular approaches to elucidate the mechanisms by which MPC differentiation is regulated by Gi signaling and by metabolic stress. Successful completion of these studies will identify novel mechanisms for the control of skeletal and metabolic homeostasis, will provide new insights into the basis for the well-established relationship between bone mass and bone marrow adipose tissue, and may provide new opportunities for developing therapies aimed at improving bone and metabolic health.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately affects the Veteran population: while 9% percent of the total US population has T2D, 25% of the Veteran population suffers from this disease. Adult ? cell mass normally increases via replication in response to insulin resistance, but failure of ? cell proliferation plus increased ? cell death lead to T2D. T2D incidence increases with age, in part due to a decreased ability of ? cells to respond to proliferative cues as they get older. Our lab identified the FoxM1 transcription factor as a critical regulator of postnatal ? cell replication and discovered that it is induced in response to several ? cell proliferative stimuli. Foxm1 expression in islets declines with age in mice and humans, but activation of FoxM1 in older mouse ? cells increases ? cell proliferation and ? cell mass, while enhancing ? cell function. Thus, our data demonstrate that FoxM1 is limiting in older ? cells and that activating FoxM1 can bypass inherent brakes in ? cell proliferation. Little is known about how proliferative stimuli induce Foxm1. Our lab discovered that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) induces Foxm1 and adult ? cell proliferation in mouse islets in vivo and ex vivo and in human islets ex vivo. The mechanisms and signaling pathways through which CTGF has these effects are currently unknown This study makes use of unique in vivo mouse models as well as ex vivo studies in both mouse and human islets from different ages. In this proposal we will identify and manipulate CTGF signaling pathways in ? cells as molecular targets for enhancing proliferation and regeneration in adult ? cells. In addition, we explore mechanisms through which FoxM1 activation enhances ? cell proliferation and survival, focusing on the antagonistic prostaglandin E receptors EP3 and EP4, which are reciprocally regulated by FoxM1 in islets. We hypothesize that CTGF acts through integrin ?1 signaling to induce Foxm1 expression and adult ? cell proliferation, and that in the setting of ? cell death, CTGF function is enhanced by macrophage-derived signals. We further hypothesize that FoxM1 activation overcomes age-related changes in ? cell proliferation in part through alterations in prostaglandin receptor activity. In this proposal we will: 1) Identify signaling pathways through which CTGF activates Foxm1 expression and ? cell proliferation; 2) Identify macrophage- derived factors that cooperate with CTGF to enhance ? cell mass regeneration; and 3) Determine the role of prostaglandin EP receptors in ? cell proliferation and survival. These studies are designed to identify molecular targets to enhance proliferation and survival in older ? cells with the goal of increasing functional ? cell mass.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Spirochetes are the etiologic agents of many globally significant emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, including syphilis, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, relapsing fever, and intestinal spirochetosis. In addition, they participate in polymicrobial infections and host-bacterial endosymbioses, and they are models for vector-borne, environmental, and zoonotic infections. Many are able to establish persistent, disseminated infection with the disease potential ranging from mild and non-specific to acute and life-threatening. The Gordon Research Conference on the Biology of Spirochetes (BoS GRC) and the accompanying Gordon Research Seminar (GRS, organized by and targeted to researchers in training) are held every two years and serve as the world?s only scientific meetings that bring together researchers who work on this structurally and taxonomically unique phylum of bacteria. The 2018 BoS GRC and GRS programs have been designed to highlight the diversity of research in spirochete biology and disease pathogenesis. Our first Aim is to promote presentation and discussion of diverse and cutting-edge research on spirochetes, including ecology, epidemiology, emergence, and evolution of the phylum, fundamental biology and virulence attributes of a variety of spirochetes, and the host responses that are both critical to clearance and to disease pathogenesis. Our second Aim is to promote career development for all scientists. To achieve these Aims, we have invited 36 speakers to the BoS GRC, many of whom are first-time attendees; three other invited speakers are trainees. We have reserved 6 slots for ?poster talks? that will be selected from the abstracts submitted by trainees for poster presentations. The GRS will include oral presentations, poster presentations, and panel discussions focused on career options and on harassment in science. Outcomes of the harassment discussion will be summarized in the GRC. The GRC will include a ?Power Hour?, an optional informal gathering for all meeting participants to address the challenges women face in science and to support the professional growth of women in science. Both the GRC and the GRS programs reflect the diversity of the research and the scientists in the field, with strong representation of women, underrepresented minorities, and international scientists as both speakers and discussion leaders. The bulk of the major advances in spirochete research during the past 20 years evolved from the discussions and collaborations fostered by the BoS GRC and, more recently, the GRS. The 2018 BoS GRC and GRS are deliberately designed to foster future collaborations based on shared and synergistic interests in, and thought-provoking discussions of, this diverse phylum.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Risk factors for anxiety disorder are important in determining who ultimately develops the disorder. However, our understanding of risk factors is rudimentary. Identification of the mechanisms of risk factors would be a step forward in understanding the etiology of anxiety disorders. Reduced hippocampal volume, dysfunction of the brain-derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) system and behavioral inhibition temperament are three anxiety risk factors identified in humans. The risk factor of reduced hippocampal volume is associated with impaired hippocampal-dependent learning, suggesting impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity in individuals at risk. BDNF is important for synaptic plasticity. Thus, we hypothesize that impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity may underlie the risk factors of both reduced hippocampal volume and BDNF dysfunction. The Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat is an inbred strain that is stress sensitive, has a reduced hippocampal volume compared to the outbred Sprague Dawley (SD) rat, has an abnormal BDNF system and expresses a behavioral inhibition. In addition, WKY rats acquire active avoidance to a greater and more persistent degree than SD rats. Abnormal avoidance is a core feature of all anxiety disorders, and the development of abnormal avoidance parallels the trajectory of PTSD (cluster C). Thus, the proposed studies will test whether impaired synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus contributes to the development of abnormal avoidance learning in the presence and absence of behavioral inhibition temperament. Four aims are proposed. Aim 1 will determine whether BDNF-induced synaptic plasticity is impaired in the hippocampus of WKY rats and if NMDA and BDNF agonists can attenuate these impairments. Aim 2 will investigate the effects of drugs acting on NMDA and BDNF-TrkB receptors on avoidance learning. Aim 3 will determine if opioid-dependent LTP in the hippocampus is impaired in WKY rats. Opioid-dependent LTP does not require NMDA or TrkB receptors. Aim 4 will investigate whether drugs acting on opioid receptors can affect the development of abnormal avoidance responding. Because opioid-dependent LTP is independent of NMDA and TrkB receptors, the comparison of opioid LTP to NMDA- and BDNF-LTP will determine whether the development of abnormal avoidance requires impairment of a specific type of LTP (i.e., NMDA) or if impairment to any of the various forms of LTP in the hippocampus can lead to the development of abnormal avoidance. The proposed studies will start to elucidate the mechanisms and interactions of three risk factors for anxiety disorders. Understanding the etiology of anxiety disorders and mechanisms of risk factors will help in the development of treatments. This is especially important to the health of veterans because a significant number of veterans are likely to develop anxiety-related disorders as a result of the extreme stress associated with combat service.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Helicobacter pylori infects the stomach of half of the world's population. This infection is a primary cause of peptic ulcer disease and a high risk factor for gastric cancer. Therefore, eradication of H. pylori infection leads to ulcer healing and lowers the risk of gastric cancer. Unil the discovery of H. pylori, it was thought that stomach acid presented an inhospitable environment for bacterial infection. However, H. pylori has uniquely developed the means of surviving and growing on the acidic surface of the human stomach, a process termed acid acclimation. Disruption of this process leads to loss of survival in acid; therefore, the components of this process would provide novel targets for eradication therapy. Current eradication therapies require the use of antibiotics along with acid-inhibitory drugs. The successful eradication by these therapies is decreasing because of increasing antibiotic resistance, resulting in a response rate of ~70% in the USA.  The growth-dependent antibiotics clarithromycin or amoxicillin are not effective unless bacteria are in growth phase. Improving acid inhibition should improve therapeutic outcome. In the first aim, we hypothesize that inhibition of acid secretion increases the number of bacteria in growth phase, making them sensitive to growth-dependent antibiotics, necessitating the requirement for administration of acid-inhibitory compounds, in addition to antibiotics for successful eradication. The finding that slow omeprazole metabolizers respond with much improved acid control and effective eradication with omeprazole and amoxicillin alone, suggests that improved acid inhibition increases the sensitivity of the organism to growth-dependent antibiotics.  From this it follows that, with more consistent and greater elevation of intragastric pH, more organisms are in the antibiotic-sensitive growth phase rather than the resistant stationary phase. Maintenance of an elevated pH for both day and night should put almost all H. pylori in growth phase. Therefore, the effect of profound acid inhibition on the bactericidal effect of amoxicillin will be tested in ivo in the gerbil.  UreI, a proton-gated urea channel, forms an inner membrane complex at least with urease and the Ni2+ insertion subunits. Formation of this complex and interaction of other proteins that comprise the complex will be identified using state-of-the-art MS/MS techniques. The novel crystal structure of UreI will be used to identify the cytoplasmic loop binding sites of the proteins interacting with the channel. In the future, the loops identified as essential can be exploited for the development of novel and specific inhibitors of UreI complex formation. Successful completion of this aim could lead to an H. pylori-specific mono-therapy for eradication.\",\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with inhaled glucocorticosteroids has been convincingly shown to increase their risk of pneumonia, but the responsible mechanisms are undefined. Work from this laboratory suggests a possible mechanism, related to the increased numbers of cells dying by apoptosis in the lungs in COPD, especially in emphysema. Uptake of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) suppresses the ability of alveolar macrophages (AMÃ˜) to fight infections. By markedly increasing AMÃ˜ efferocytosis, glucocorticoids plus apoptotic cells cause greater immune defects than either stimulus alone. This effect is called glucocorticoid-augmented efferocytosis (GCAE). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 19-25 nucleotide-long non-coding RNAs that coordinately target large numbers of genes and reduce their protein products. Preliminary data imply that defective AMÃ˜ function is caused by down-regulation of specific miRNAs by GCAE (but not by apoptotic cells alone or glucocorticosteroids alone). The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel, inhalational treatments, based on transient over-expression of these specifically decreased miRNAs, to reverse defective AMÃ˜ immune function when COPD patients taking inhaled glucocorticoids present with community-acquired pneumonia. This project will use ex vivo investigation of AMÃ˜ from both smoke-exposed mice and human volunteers (including active smokers and patients with COPD), and an established murine model of pneumococcal pneumonia. Its immediate goals are to: (a) confirm that GCAE increases pneumococcal pneumonia risk and severity, and in the process, validate a murine model for testing strategies to reverse those defects; (b) define  GCAE-induced defects in human AMÃ˜ functionally and by whole- transcriptome analysis, identifying genes uniquely regulated by the GCAE x pneumococcus interaction; (c) validate and optimize miRNA-over-expression to reverse the adverse effects of GCAE on AMÃ˜ defensive functions. Successful completion of this project could lead to more precisely personalized therapies and better outcomes in COPD, currently the third leading cause of death in the USA, and the most expensive-to-treat chronic disease on a per-case basis among Veterans.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Objectives: The main objectives of this proposal are to: (1) define how oncogenic EGFR/MAPK signal transduction influences the expression of MHC molecules and, (2) characterize the impact of therapies that target the EGFR and enzymes in the MAPK pathway on anti-tumor immune responses and the response to immunotherapy. Research Plan: In Aim 1, we will use well-characterized cell lines to model human cancers driven by EGFR over-expression, oncogenic RAS mutations, and oncogenic BRAF mutations. These cell lines will be used to determine how oncogenic EGFR/MAPK signal transduction and the medications developed to combat this signaling, impact the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of MHC class I expression. In Aim 2, we will couple these same medications with relevant murine tumor models to determine how these medications impact in vivo immune responses to tumor challenge, the expression of relevant immune system genes, and the response to immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint blockade and therapeutic vaccination. Methods: Using the above models, we will combine EGFR, BRAFV600E, and MEK1/2 inhibitor treatment with chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to define the impact of EGFR/MAPK signaling on the recruitment of transcription factors and the placement of epigenetic marks at the MHCI promoter. Using reporter assays, we will define regions within MHC class I promoters that are responsive to EGFR/MAPK signaling. To explore more complex regulatory mechanisms, we will investigate how EGFR/MAPK signaling impacts the function of an enhancer-blocking DNA element known to regulate MHC expression. We will also determine how EGFR/MAPK signaling impacts the recruitment/binding of CTCF, a protein that regulates MHC expression by mitigating complex chromatin interactions, to sites within the MHC. For our in vivo studies, we will use therapy- responsive and non-responsive tumor models to determine how EGFR/MAPK inhibitors impact tumor growth, the generation of tumor-reactive and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, and the tumor microenvironment using flow cytometry, functional cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assays, RNA analysis and other approaches. We will explore the novel hypothesis that these medications have clinically relevant tumor-dependent and tumor- independent effects on host anti-tumor immunity that can be used to enhance the response to immunotherapy. Clinical Relevance: Inhibitors of the EGFR and MAPKs are already used to treat Veterans with advanced cancer with variable response rates. To help integrate these medications with new and developing therapies that are immune based, it will be crucial to have a sophisticated understanding of how these kinase inhibitors influence immune events in vivo. Indeed, despite the fact these inhibitors are already being combined with immunotherapies in clinical trials for those with advanced cancer, their impact on the immune system is largely undefined. By characterizing how these medications influence immune responses, we can develop a rational framework to optimize the use of these medications alone and in combination with immune-based therapy. In addition, by defining the mechanisms that govern EGFR/MAPK-mediated MHC repression, new approaches can be developed to disrupt the MHCI down regulation and resulting tumor cell immune escape that occurs commonly in cancer.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cigarette smoke (CS) suppresses the immune system, and smoking is the major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exposure to cigarette smoke is associated with a significant increase in the risk for respiratory viral infections. Our work is to understand how CS compromises the human innate immune system's response to influenza virus infection, and to find novel methods to control the infection. Epidemiological studies show that influenza infection is seven times more common and is much more severe in smokers than nonsmokers. Retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) plays an important role in the recognition of, and cytokine induction by, influenza virus and other RNA viruses. Our previous studies, using an ex vivo human organ culture model, have found that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) suppresses antiviral and innate immune responses in influenza virus infected human lung through oxidative inhibition of viral-mediated induction of the pattern recognition receptor, RIG-I. This immunosuppressive effect of CS may play a role in the enhanced susceptibility of smokers to serious influenza infection in the lung. We propose to use an in vivo mouse model to study the mechanism by which CS suppresses the expression and function of the RIG-I initiated innate response to influenza virus. The hypothesis of this proposal is that long-term CS impairs the protective RIG-I initiated antiviral response to influenza virus in vivo while RIG-I overexpression and antioxidants provide therapeutic inhibition of immunosuppression from smoking.  To test the central hypothesis, we propose to pursue the following integrated specific aims: AIM 1: Is RIG-I knockdown by CS responsible for the suppression of the RIG-I initiated antiviral response in CS-exposed mice? AIM 2: Can RIG-I overexpression in mouse lung reverse the CS-mediated suppression of the antiviral response in CS-exposed mice? AIM 3: Can antioxidants restore the RIG-I initiated antiviral response in CS-exposed mice?  These studies will significantly enhance our understanding of the mechanism whereby CS suppresses the human immune system and predisposes humans to worse outcomes of influenza virus infection. Determination of the molecular mechanisms of immunosuppression will be important in designing strategies for the development of new and novel treatments for cigarette smoke enhanced lung infections, particularly those due to influenza.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Liver fibrosis is the result of chronic liver damage from various etiologies including alcohol abuse, obesity, or viral hepatitis. Chronic liver disease may progress to cirrhosis, an end stage disease and major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and in particular among Veterans. Patients with chronic liver disease show intestinal bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis. They also demonstrate increased intestinal permeability, and disease severity correlates with systemic levels of bacterial products. Although experimental liver fibrosis is dependent on gut derived bacterial products, yet the exact contribution of the commensal microflora to liver fibrosis is unknown. Since the interaction of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with the innate immune system can also confer protection to the host, we subjected germfree mice to experimental models of liver fibrosis. Results from our laboratory demonstrate that germfree mice show exacerbated liver fibrosis as compared with conventional mice. Livers of germfree mice have a decreased expression of the antioxidant heat shock protein (Hsp)-25, more oxidative stress and a higher rate of apoptosis. The focus of this application is to further characterize the relationship between the intestinal microflora and the progression of chronic liver disease. We hypothesize that the commensal microflora is an important suppressor of oxidative stress and hence fibrosis upon chronic liver injury in mice. Our experimental approach is to apply mouse models of toxin-induced and cholestatic liver fibrosis to germfree and conventional mice and to investigate the contribution of the bacterial microflora to chronic liver disease (Aim 1). We will then assess the mechanism by which the microflora ameliorates experimental liver fibrosis. The focus will be on Hsp25 that is lower expressed in hepatocytes of germfree mice as compared with conventional mice and that has antioxidant properties. We will test the new concept that bacterial products or metabolites induce Hsp25 in hepatocytes. We will also focus on hepatic stellate cells to explain the phenotype with increased fibrosis under germ-free conditions (Aim 2). We will then supplement germfree mice with one bacterial metabolite or colonize germ-free mice with indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) synthesizing bacteria, and subject them to experimental liver fibrosis. A preventive and therapeutic approach will be chosen. Bacterial products or metabolites might confer antioxidant properties directly or via the induction of antioxidant molecules to the liver (Aim 3). We believe these studies will provide important insights into the contribution of the commensal microflora to liver fibrosis. This will establish a novel shift in the current paradigm that all translocated bacteria and their products are bad for liver injury and chronic liver disease. Eventually this approach might lead to new therapeutic targets and therapies for patients with chronic liver disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         PTSD is a disabling condition consequent to trauma exposure. Recent evidence demonstrates PTSD secondary to combat exposure prospectively increases risk of early incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), with a meta-analyses we have recently completed revealing that PTSD is associated with a hazard ratio of 1.34 for incident CHD or CHD-specific mortality. The rate of PTSD among Veterans who have served during Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, and New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) is more than double that seen in the non-veteran population and consistent with that previously seen among Vietnam era veterans. It is essential for purposes of risk stratification, risk reduction, and health services planning that we establisha more complete understanding of the illness burden associated with military service, and develop PTSD associated risk markers that predict early onset of CVD. Endothelial dysfunction is the earliest indicator of risk for incident CVD. In a pilot series with 23 OIF/OEF/OND veterans we have found that, compared to individuals without any symptoms of PTSD, those diagnosed with PTSD secondary to military service demonstrate significant impairment in endothelial function and that even those with sub-syndromal PTSD symptoms demonstrate impairment relative to those without symptoms. The Specific Aim of this proposed study is therefore to examine endothelial (dys) function as a promising mechanistic link between PTSD and risk for incident CVD. OIF/OEF veterans with a range of PTSD symptom severity (N=300) will complete our laboratory protocol that includes assessment of the endothelial response during standard hyperemic probe and during emotional stress, administered under controlled conditions, with the majority (N=230) repeating this protocol approximately 1 year late. Assessment of autonomic and HPA axis activity, and of contributors to vascular homeostasis (e.g., endothelin-1) will be accomplished during the protocol. We hypothesize that: 1) a diagnosis of PTSD will be associated with endothelial dysfunction; we will explore (1a) whether there is a dose response relationship such that, as severity of PTSD symptoms increase we observe greater endothelial dysfunction.; 2) A change in PTSD symptom severity from time 1 to time 2, will be associated with a concomitant change in the endothelial response to both hyperemic and emotional challenge. We will also explore the association of endothelial (dys) function during emotional stress with markers of sympathetic, parasympathetic, and HPA axis activity and with associated contributors to vascular homeostasis.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The gold standard for the treatment of severe peripheral artery disease remains bypass grafting with autologous vein. However, when vein is not available, prosthetic grafts must be utilized and are associated with very high failure rates, approaching 70% at just 2 years. The primary cause of failure of prosthetic grafts is development of neointimal hyperplasia. It is well established tht nitric oxide (NO) is a potent inhibitor of neointimal hyperplasia. The two main classes of NO donors that have been used to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia locally are diazeniumdiolates and S-nitrosothiols (RSNO). Graft modifications with either class of NO donors have shown only limited improvement in graft function due to a short duration of NO release. However, RSNO remain attractive because they are present in human plasma and can release NO upon reaction with light, metal ions, or L-ascorbic acid (AA). Thus, to overcome the limitation of drug delivery duration, we propose to develop and evaluate a catalytically active graft that will release NO at the blood-material interface for an extended duration of time by immobilizing AA to the luminal surface of the graft. This concept takes advantage of the limitless reservoir of circulating RSNO that will react with AA on the graft surface to release NO. We hypothesize that a catalytically active prosthetic graft engineered to incorporate AA on the lumen surface will utilize endogenous circulating RSNO to generate NO at the blood-material interface and inhibit the formation of neointimal hyperplasia. To confirm the feasibility of our approach, we synthesized a first generation poly(1,8 octanediol-citrate-ascorbate) (POCA) copolymer and demonstrated prolonged generation of NO upon contact with RSNO solutions in vitro. Preliminary data show 30% POCA degradation at 2 months. This is important, as NO will be released as long as POCA is present on the graft. By the time POCA is completely degraded, the NO will have simulated endogenous endothelialization of the graft, thereby abrogating the need for external NO release. Supporting our approach, we implanted a POCA graft using a guinea pig aortic interposition model and found less graft hyperplasia at 1 month. Thus, given our promising preliminary data, we propose to investigate our hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: 1) synthesize and characterize biocompatible AA containing polydiolcitrate copolymers that catalyze the conversion of RSNO to NO and use these copolymers to fabricate catalytically active ePTFE grafts; 2) evaluate the safety, biocompatibility, and efficacy of the catalytically active POCA-ePTFE graft at inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia in vivo; and 3) evaluate the biocompatibility and efficacy of an optimized catalytically active POCA-ePTFE graft at inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia in an atherosclerotic animal model in vivo. Currently, prosthetic grafts are a poor substitute for autologous vein and there is a significant need to develop novel strategies to improve prosthetic graft patency rates. Through a multidisciplinary collaboration, we have demonstrated the feasibility of our approach. Successful completion of the studies described in this proposal will provide an innovative approach to locally generate NO, an important therapeutic agent, while overcoming limitations of other graft modification approaches, and directly lead to preclinical investigations. Once validated, this technology has the potential to positively impact veteran health care.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          It is being increasingly recognized that multiple pathways contribute to necrotic cell death in a highly regulated fashion and are amenable to specific interventions. Processes that have been implicated include necrotic cell death related to development of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) regulated by cyclophilin D (CypD), necroptosis mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIPK1 and RIPK3) and sensitive to inhibition by necrostatin-1, and pyroptosis resulting from activation of caspases 1 and 11. The ultimate downstream event required for several of the necrotic, immunogenic processes is glycine-sensitive opening of a plasma membrane channel. Preliminary studies for this proposal show that an additional pathway of iron-mediated cell death termed 'ferroptosis' may account for the iron-related cell injury involved in several common and clinically relevant forms of acute kidney injury (AKI). Ferroptosis is subject to modulation by novel small molecule inhibitors that emerged from chemical library screening, ferrostatins, as well as by other lipophilic antioxidants and by inhibition of NADPH oxidase. The objectives of this proposal are to further investigate and clarify the mechanisms of ferroptosis and its expression in freshly isolated kidney proximal tubules ex vivo, its impact on AKI in vivo, and its interactions with necroptosis and cyclophilin D pathways of regulated necrosis to address the hypothesis that regulated necrosis resulting from additive effects of ferroptosis, induction of the MPT mediated by CypD, and necroptosis contributes to tubule cell killing during AKI and is a target for pharmacological intervention. Studies will utilie tubules from rabbits and mice subjected to injury ex vivo and in vivo models of mouse AKI along with pharmacologic modulators and mutant mice deficient in CypD or RIPK3, newly developed mice deficient in both CypD+RIPK3 or caspase+RIPK3, and mice deficient in NADPH oxidase 4. Tubules isolated by collagenase digestion will be subjected to oxidant and iron-induced injury by tert-butylhydroperoxide or by hydroxyquinoline plus ferrous ammonium sulfate, or to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Lethal membrane damage will be quantitated as the final endpoint, and, at time points preceding that damage, measurements of ATP, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, and lipid peroxidation will be made to assess the mechanisms of this injury and its modification by ferrostatins, pharmacologic inhibitors of the MPT and necroptosis, and absence of pathway proteins. AKI will be produced in vivo by glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis, clamp ischemia, or cisplatin followed by assessment of renal function and structural changes. These studies will further elucidate the role of newly characterized forms of regulated necrosis during AKI and provide insight into approaches for ameliorating them and the organ failure that results.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The initial event in glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteonecrosis, in many cases, is death of bone-synthesizing osteoblasts. Our preliminary work shows that this osteoblast death, at least in major part, is not directly caused by the GC. Bone growth and survival is regulated by many systems, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) being of critical importance. Developing osteoblasts, prominent in in high turnover bone such as femoral head trabecular bone, express the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor. We discovered that osteoblasts express VEGF strongly in response to ACTH. Continuous steroid treatment reduces ACTH to very low levels. In rabbits with high-dose GC, we showed that intermittent administration of ACTH greatly reduced osteonecrosis. Our hypothesis is that ACTH is a key regulator of bone growth and survival, particularly in regions with rapid bone turnover. However, mesenchymal stem cells or osteoblasts express VEGF receptors and ACTH receptors. Further, our pilot studies show that VEGF increases growth and differentiation or osteoblasts. Because ACTH is one of several factors that regulate VEGF production in bone, systematic study is needed to determine how ACTH, VEGF, and other regulatory pathways interact in bone.    Gaps in understanding include that downstream actions of ACTH in bone cells are poorly understood. The interactions of ACTH with other systems that regulate VEGF are unclear. These interactions may be mediated by inflammatory cells, hypoxia, or additional cell signals. It is not known whether ACTH synthesis occurs in bone. It is not known how ACTH action in bone varies with frequency or dose of ACTH administration. Aim 1 will study the mechanism of response of osteoblasts to ACTH and VEGF. To assure relevancy to human disease, study will include human cells in vitro. To determine whether ACTH provides survival signals in addition to VEGF, we will study the response of osteoblasts to VEGF, with and without ACTH. Cell proliferation and matrix synthesis will be measured, as well as production of regulatory cytokines by osteoblasts. To define the VEGF response, we will make osteoblasts with VEGF receptors -1 and -2 (ft-1 and fk-1) eliminated. This will allow ACTH effects on osteoblasts to be defined in the absence of autocrine VEGF response. Aim 2 will determine how ACTH modulates VEGF production in GC-treated bone. To determine how immune cells regulate production of VEGF by osteoblasts, we will make mixed cultures including macrophages or lymphocytes. In    addition, the Scarb1 mouse model, which has elevated ACTH at normal GC and dense bone, will be studied to determine changes to bone and vasculature in vivo. We will characterize VEGF production in culture, and determine whether VEGF regulation involves specifc cytokines, in tissue cultures and in mice. To establish the effect of hypoxia, we will compare VEGF production in 7% versus 20% oxygen in human cell cultures. Analysis will include production of key cytokines as a function of oxygen tension. To determine whether ACTH synthesis occurs in bone, we will analyze pro-opiomelanocorticoid (POMC) expression and processing in osteoblasts, lymphocytes and macrophages. Aim 3 will defne the dependency of VEGF synthesis in bone on ACTH concentration and dose interval using depot methylprednisolone acetate (MPA)-treated rabbits. Rabbits are the best in vivo model for CG-induced osteonecrosis; steroid diabetes will occur but will be controlled with insulin. Effects on VEGF production of varying IV ACTH injection, relative to depot MPA alone or no treatment, will establish concentration dependency. ACTH will be injected daily, at 8 AM, at 0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg, for 28 days. Osteonecrosis, bone turnover, serum ACTH and corticosteroids will be measured. This will establish the dose dependency of ACTH osteonecrosis suppression. To defne effect of frequency of administration on efficacy, we will compare the effects of ACTH 0.05 ?kg and 0.15 ?kg twice daily versus 0.1 or 0.3 ?kg once daily. This work will use innovative methods to defne a novel metabolic regulatory pathway in bone. It will establish new mechanisms that contribute to osteonecrosis, which may allow reduction of its occurrence.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The amyloid plaques made of Ab peptide and neurofibrillary tangles made of abnormal tau protein define the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. Many diverse studies support an initiating role for amyloid in Alzheimer's disease. However, these findings also clearly demonstrate both that the presence of tau is required for amyloid mediated neuronal dysfunction and that pathological tau protein causes neurodegeneration. Furthermore, pathological tau, including neurofibrillary tangles, characterizes the neuropathology of blast induced traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and other related tauopathies. Traumatic brain injury is increasingly prevalent in the Veteran population. Both aging related changes and brain injury dramatically increase the risk for neurodegenerative dementia disorders. Thus it is imperative we develop treatments that can quickly bridge the gap between bench and bedside. Development of pharmacological interventions for tau mediated neurodegeneration is the long-term goal of this research project. Our drug discovery strategy employs an integrated approach aimed at expediting drug repurposing. Our previously published work demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods by screening a library of 1120 approved drugs to identify a single validated compound capable of ameliorating tau pathology in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy. We now propose to extend this drug repositioning approach to a drug collection spanning most of the drugs with a history of clinical use (~5400 drugs). The objectives of this project are to: Identify compounds reducing tau aggregation in a transgenic C. elegans model of tauopathy and in a human cell culture model of tau aggregation; Prioritize hits based on their CNS penetration and identify dosing and routes of administration that modulate pathological tau in young mice; Use novel compounds identified above to intervene in symptomatic tauopathy mice. Completion of these studies will reveal FDA approved candidate drugs for use as tau targeted therapeutics for both Alzheimer's disease and blast induced traumatic brain injury, providing justification for the clinical testing of repurposed approved drugs for treatment of tauopathy disorders.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         SUMMARY  Alcoholic fatty liver disease (ALD) is one of the primary causes of chronic liver diseases in the United States. In particular, ALD is becoming a prevalent health issue among veterans due to an increase in obesity, diabetes, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and drug abuse in conjunction with alcohol consumption. Disturbance of circadian rhythmicity is a risk factor for the development of liver and metabolic diseases. However, the association between the liver circadian clock and ALD remains an intriguing but unexplored research area. In addition, the most advanced analytical tools, such as transcriptomics (RNA- seq) and metabolomics (GC/MS), have not been well utilized to study ALD.  Nuclear receptors are key liaisons between the molecular clock machinery and metabolic diseases. My laboratory has pioneered major discoveries in the in vivo function of small heterodimer partner (SHP, Nrob2) in hepatic bile acid and lipid metabolism. The proposed study is based on our newly discovered role of SHP in integrating the circadian clock, metabolic network, and the ER stress signaling in the liver.  The overall objective is to establish an integrated molecular circadian network in alcohol mediated ER stress response and steatosis. The central hypothesis is that ethanol-binge alters rhythmic SHP expression in the liver, which in turn modulates Npas2 and the downstream targets in the ER stress signaling and lipogenesis pathways. Specifically, we will elucidate how alcohol, SHP and Npas2 coordinately control CHOP and SREBP1c gene transcription, protein stability, and activity, and establish the modulation by alcohol of the entie liver transcriptome and metabolome. Aim #1: To elucidate a SHP and alcohol mediated molecular circadian pathway that controls ER stress signaling; Aim #2: To determine the effect of liver specific Npas2 knockdown on the ER stress response and steatosis mediated by SHP and ethanol-binge; and Aim #3: To establish hepatic circadian transcriptome and metabolome networks interlocked by SHP and ethanol-binge. In addition to our unique in vivo mouse (SHP-/-) and in vitro cell models, new liver Npas2 knockdown mice will be generated and employed for the study. Our approach makes full use of molecular biology, systems biology, and genome wide high throughput analysis (RNA-seq and GC/MS) to address an important scientific question that is directly relevant to the health of veterans.  This study is innovative both conceptually and in the implementation of experimental approaches. The planned experimental strategies are comprehensive, yet feasible. This project will uncover for the first time a novel interplay between alcohol and the liver circadian clock to control the ER stress response and hepatic lipid metabolism. The discoveries made from this study are highly likely to enable substantial advances in ALD research, making this project of high clinical significance and translational value.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Our microbiome influences how our immune system functions. Our microbiome has changed as a result of living in highly hygienic industrialized countries. A major change in our microbiome is loss of exposure to helminths (parasitic worms). Prior to the 1940's, helminth colonization was nearly universal and there is strong evidence that this exposure helped to shape our genome. Loss of these previously ubiquitous members of our paleobiome, can have far ranging immunologic effect. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) currently afflicts more than one million Americans and many thousands of veterans. The incidence of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases increased dramatically after the 1940's in North America and Europe. These diseases are rare in less developed tropical countries. Veterans that served in Vietnam or were prisoners of war are at lower risk of developing IBD than are other veterans. Moreover, as countries develop economically the incidence of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases increase. Thus, IBD is a globally emerging disorder. Although specific genes predispose to IBD, there is strong evidence that a change in environment concurrent with socioeconomic improvement confers risk for developing the disorder. We propose that a change from our historic paleobiome, the lack of helminth exposure, in developed countries is an important risk factor for developing IBD and other immune-mediated diseases. We and others have shown that colonization with helminths protects mice from immune-mediated colitis, encephalitis, diabetes, and airway disease. These are models of diseases that have emerged within highly industrialized countries. Understanding how helminth exposure decreases immune mediated diseases will guide development of targeted therapy to prevent or treat those diseases. Th17 cells control pro-inflammatory pathological responses, like that of IBD. Recently it has become clear that Th17 cells are heterogeneous. In addition to making IL17, highly pro-inflammatory Th17 cells make IFNy (Th17/Th1). Other Th17 cells with a regulatory phenotype express FoxP3 or make IL10 (Th17/Treg). Immune mediated disease likely results from dysregulated Th17 plasticity. We discovered that mucosal IL17 production is inhibited by exposure to helminths and that this exposure decreases Th17/Th1 and increases Th17/Treg percentages in lamina propria and mesenteric lymph node cell populations. Our hypothesis is that helminth exposure protects against colitis by altering Th17 heterogeneity/plasticity. This project will test this hypothesis wth 3 specific aims. Our first aim will explore the mechanisms enabled by helminth exposure that inhibit Th17/Th1 plasticity with focus on Stat6 signaling. Our second aim will explore the mechanisms enabled by helminth exposure that augment Th17/Treg plasticity. Our third aim will explore how changes in Th circuitry alters intestinal epithelial cell function with focus on epithelial cell pSTAT3 expression. Our research is unique in that we are exploring possible root causes for the emergence of autoimmune and immune-mediated inflammatory disease in modern civilizations. In addition, these studies will provide insight into how helminth-exposed individuals that live or served in less developed countries may respond to immunologic challenges. Furthermore, we are examining in vivo how infectious organisms alter immune pathways to influence chronic inflammatory diseases like those that afflict veterans.\",\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Hyperglycemia is the major risk factor for development of diabetic retinopathy. Tight control of serum glucose levels is currently viewed as the primary means to slow progression to retinopathy, but the mechanisms by which glucose enters the retina and how they become perturbed in diabetes remains unclear. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of how hyperglycemia affects the outer retina (RPE and photoreceptors) and identifying methods to ameliorate glucose-induced outer retina dysfunction and early biomarkers of diabetic retinopathy is important. Recently, it has been shown that systemic reduction of the facilitative diffusion glucose transporter, GLUT1 will reduce glucose levels in the retina; however, these studies do not provide a mechanism or means to control glucose entry specifically to the retina via the blood retinal barrier (BRB). The first objective of this proposal is to determine if reductions in GLUT1 within the RPE leads to reduced retinal glucose accumulation within the RPE/outer retina, prevention of RPE dysfunction and early biomarkers of diabetic retinopathy in mouse models of diabetes. The second objective is to investigate mechanisms of GLUT1 modulation by insulin and to determine if abrogation of insulin signal transduction in the RPE can mitigate abnormal RPE function in mouse models of diabetes by regulation of GLUT1 expression and localization. We hypothesize that (1) hyperglycemia-induced increases in the expression and redistribution of GLUT1 in the RPE mediates diabetes-associated reductions in RPE/outer retina function and early signs of retinopathy, (2) that insulin also modulates glucose transport by GLUT1 in the RPE and (3) that blockade of insulin signaling in the RPE will exacerbate retinal pathophysiology found in a mouse model of diabetes. To test these hypotheses, a mouse model of type 1 diabetes will be employed to investigate GLUT1 expression and distribution within the apical and basolateral membranes of the RPE and determine if this is concomitant with an accumulation of intracellular glucose. To determine if reductions in GLUT1 expression prevents outer retina dysfunction, a haploinsufficient Glut1+/- mouse and mice in which the Glut1 gene is specifically inactivated only within the RPE will be utilized. To additionally assess how insulin affects GLUT1-mediated glucose entry and accumulation in the retina, conditional inactivation the insulin receptor (IR) will be employed to abrogate downstream signaling from this receptor. In vitro analysis of cultured RPE cells will also be used to determine if insulin treatment alters glucose transport through regulation of GLUT1 by affecting its association with a binding partner, GIPC and/or the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4-2. These experiments will determine the role that GLUT1 plays in outer retina dysfunction as a result of hyperglycemia, elucidate how insulin is involved in GLUT1 modulation, and identify a mechanism which can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         HIV/AIDS is a significant health risk to both male and female veterans, and is transmitted predominantly by heterosexual intercourse. A roadblock to the discovery of efficacious prevention modalities, including vaccines and microbicides, is the incomplete understanding of basic virus-host interactions that underlie the acquisition of mucosal HIV-1 infection in the female genital tract. Two recent NIH workshops on Mucosal Immunity and HIV Prevention highlighted under-explored fundamental questions that need to be addressed, including anatomical sites of early virus infection in the female reproductive tract (FRT), and the influence of endogenous sex hormones on the mucosal environment and susceptibility to HIV-1. We submit that the endometrial mucosa of the uterus constitutes a site of early HIV-1 infection. (i) The upper FRT (uFRT) is accessible to pathogens. The uterus is readily accessible to sperm, experimental microspheres, viral and bacterial pathogens, and possibly HIV-1 virions attached to sperm. (ii) The cervical mucus is an imperfect barrier and upward myometrium contractions likely promote delivery of semen content into the uFRT. (iii) The uFRT comprises an abundance of HIV-1 target cells beneath the epithelium lining. (iv) Cellular and innate immune functions in the uFRT are suppressed during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. (v) Previous studies on HIV-1 infection of UEC are. (vi) Innovative and transformative virologic strategies are available in our laboratory that will facilitate physiologically relevant studies using primary mucosal transmission models, including transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 infectious molecular clones (IMC), and HIV- 1 reporter genomes that augment both sensitivity and specificity for dissecting early virus-host mucosal interactions. (vii) We present preliminary results that to our knowledge demonstrate for the first time UEC are susceptible to infection by T/F. Therefore, there exists essential virologic underpinnings and compelling rationale to further examine the uFRT as a potential site for the acquisition of mucosal HIV-1 infection and transmission. Our central hypothesis is that the uFRT mucosa is vulnerable to productive T/F HIV-1 infection. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To determine the susceptibility of primary UEC to productive infection by T/F, chronic control and laboratory strains of HIV-1. Viruses expressing T/F envs from isogenic reporter proviral genomes will be studied, enabling sensitive and specific analyses of productive HIV-1 infection in a primary UEC model of virus infection. Importantly, chronic control viruses will be analyzed in parallel experiments to rigorously address the question of whether T/F viruses possess unique fitness properties for infecting potential target cells that exist in the uFRT mucosa. (2) To elucidate cis and trans infection pathways by which T/F HIV-1 spreads from primary UEC to endometrial CD4+ T lymphocytes. Mucosal CD4+ T cells isolated from endometrium will first be analyzed for their susceptibility to infection by T/F and control viruses to establish important underpinnings for subsequent experiments with UEC. The following experiments will elucidate susceptibilities of autologous CD4+ T cells to HIV-1 infection mediated by de novo produced virus from infected UEC or transcytosis of intact/infectious virus particles. The results will be analyzed to elucidate virus subtype- and strain-specific susceptibilities of UEC and CD4+ T lymphocytes to HIV-1 infection, and identify mechanisms/pathways of virus entry and correlations of these factors with menstrual cycle stage. Such findings promise to provide critical underpinnings for translational prevention research initiatives.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Alcohol abuse exacts a major toll on health and health costs in Veterans. Indeed, even though there is an epidemic of hepatitis C in the U.S., alcohol-related liver injury remains a higher cause of mortality. Studies from the Veterans Administration showed that patients with cirrhosis and superimposed alcoholic hepatitis had > 60% mortality over a four-year period of time, with most of those deaths occurring in the first few months. Thus, the prognosis for this stage of ALD is worse than many common types of cancer, such as breast, prostate and colon. Unfortunately, there is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of ALD, and this makes the need for this proposed research even more compelling. Recent studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that dietary unsaturated fat, specifically rich in linoleic acid (LA), exacerbated alcohol-mediated liver and intestinal injury in an experimental animal model of ALD. Our preliminary data show elevated levels of circulating oxidized LA metabolites, specifically 9- and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (9-and 13-HODEs) in parallel with the up-regulation of hepatic 12/15 lipoxygenase (12/15-LO), a key enzyme involved in the oxidation of LA, in an animal model of ALD. These findings led us to postulate that specific oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs) play a significant role in ALD. OXLAMs are natural ligands to the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a ligand-gated non-selective cation channel with high permeability for Ca2+. Recent studies demonstrate a critical role for Ca2+ release in inflammasome activation, which are key signaling platforms for stressor-induced pathogenesis, and which, upon activation, trigger the release of highly pro- inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1? (IL-1?)  and interleukin-18 (IL-18). IL-1? release is thought to be a critical mediator of inflammation and  thus, serves as a potential therapeutic target for treating hepatic inflammation in ALD. We propose that OXLAMs contribute to the EtOH-induced hepatic inflammation and injury via two major mechanisms: 1) OXLAMs-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and hepatocyte death; and 2) OXLAM/TRPV1/Ca2+-mediated inflammasome activation and IL-1? release. The proposed studies will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced liver injury, including alcohol-diet interactions, which may lead to identification of new therapeutic targets and potential dietary interventions for treating ALD, as well as help to explain why only some heavy drinkers develop clinically important ALD. Our research will be achieved through 3 specific aims: Aim 1. Evaluate whether OXLAMs exacerbate EtOH-mediated liver injury via induction of mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, and hepatocyte cell death in an animal model of ALD; Aim 2. Determine whether OXLAMs contribute to an EtOH-induced hepatic pro-inflammatory response via OXLAM-TRPV1-mediated inflammasome activation and subsequent increase in IL-? release in an animal model of ALD. Aim 3. Explore the role of OXLAMs in monocytes/macrophages inflammasome activation in Alcoholic Hepatitis in Veterans.',\n",
       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The U.S. Veteran population suffers from high rates of depression and significant mental health symptom burden. Sadly, suicide rates reflect this as well, being significantly higher for Veterans relative to the non-Veteran populations. Therefore, a critical need exists to identify the complex gene x environment interactions and the underlying neural substrates that drive the pathogenesis of depression. Clinical observations abound associating reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression with depression and increased BDNF expression with effective antidepressant responses. Rodent models have reliably confirmed those associations, and revealed important mechanistic roles for hippocampal BDNF expression in the response to antidepressant drugs. However, the neurobiological mechanisms by which reduced BDNF expression might engender vulnerability to the development of depression remain unclear. The existence of a high frequency polymorphism of the bdnf gene (Val66Met; allelic frequency 20- 35%) in humans that reduces BDNF protein levels makes this a highly relevant biomedical problem that needs to be addressed. Inflammation or chronic stress, as environmental precipitants of depression represent an ideal context to conduct translationally relevant mechanism based experiments aimed at understanding this gene x environment interaction. Our exciting new preliminary data, in both human and mouse model systems, suggest that BDNF may play an important negative regulatory role on microglial activation state, and disruption of the BDNF system sensitizes mice to the development of inflammation or stress-induced depressive-like behavior. The experiments proposed in this application will utilize two of the quintessential mouse models of environmentally-induced depressive-like behavior and novel methodology in a human postmortem system to better understand the interactions between the BDNF system and microglia activation state in relation to depression scores and prefrontal cortical (PFC)- dependent symptom profiles (e.g. impulsivity, cognitive flexibility and attention).  We propose to test the hypothesis that BDNF deficiency induces vulnerability to development of PFC- dependent depressive-like behaviors as a direct result of increased microglial reactivity and neurotoxic tryptophan metabolism. If successful, the new experimental data that emerge from these experiments can be immediately `reverse translated' to the clinic to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for vulnerable patients.\",\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Mechanical forces and, in particular, fluid shear stress (FSS), play critical roles in endothelia t regulate vascular reactivity and in renal epithelia to affect transepithelial cation transport that collectively, determine blood pressue (BP). Mechano-regulation of tubular cation transport is an important regulator of renal sodium (Na) homeostasis and infers the existence of mechano-sensors in renal epithelia. Cholesterol (chol)-rich lipid rafts (LRs), signaling platforms located n the plasma membrane (PM), are mechano-sensors that induce paracrine-mediated vasodilation (ie nitric oxide synthesis) in endothelia; however, little is known about their sensory function in  renal epithelia. Chol maintains the integrity of LRs, and effects on LR chol content impacts FSS-mediated signaling. The FSS-sensitive signaling pathways which regulate mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cells (1) are localized to caveolin-1 (cav-1) and flotillin-2 (flot-2), respectively, expressing LRs in collecting duct (CD) cells, and (2) control changes in COX-2 expression and PGE2 release, respectively. Additionally, chol integration into E-prostanoid (EP) receptor expressing LRs can alter signaling that regulates transepithelial Na absorption. In PRELIMINARY STUDIES an anti-diuretic, hypertensive phenotype was uncovered in chol fed mice, volume expanded by parenteral saline, that was associated with suppressed flow-mediated COX-2 activity and PGE2 release in microdissected cortical CDs (CCDs). Thus, the final integrated epithelial response to tubular flow rate is determined by chol calibrated, FSS-mediated PGE2 release and EP receptor stimulation which regulate Na transport. We hypothesize that hypercholesterolemia alters the chol content in LRs of the renal CD to regulate flow/FSS-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 release which, via autocrine/paracrine EP- receptor based signaling, influences Na transport in the distal nephron. This hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims (SAs): SA1. Test whether chol-rich LRs are mechanosensory platforms for FSS-mediated stimulation of polycystin-2 (PC-2) and MAPK activation. SA1.a Evaluate the localization of PC-2, a mechano-sensitive channel responsible for apical entry of Ca2+ into CD cells, and MAPK (p38, ERK) within specific populations of LRs in CD cells and microdissected CCDs. SA1.b Determine whether FSS leads to translocation of PC-2 and MAPK out of their respective chol-rich LRs to allow for maximal PC-2 activation and MAPK phosphorylation. SA1.c Test whether LR chol content affects resting localization and FSS-induced translocation of PC-2 and MAPK out of LRs. SA2. Test whether short-term chol ingestion leads to incorporation of chol into the CCD that alters flow-mediated COX stimulation, PGE2 release and Na excretion. SA2.a Evaluate whether dietary chol consumption incorporates into the renal CCD SA2.b Determine whether chol integration into renal CCDs modifies net PGE2 generating capacity, flow- mediated PGE2 release, Na excretion and, in turn, BP. SA3. Test whether short-term chol ingestion inhibits flow-mediated PGE2 release and alters EP receptor dependent signaling, to enhance transepithelial Na transport in microperfused CCDs SA3.a Evaluate whether chol incorporation in CCDs suppresses flow-mediated PGE2 release to augment Na absorption. SA3.b Test whether chol incorporation in CCDs modifies EP receptor signaling to enhance Na absorption.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The incretin glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has been a major focus of diabetes research and drug development for the past 20 years. The incretin system is essential for normal glucose homeostasis and recent evidence indicates that there is specific dysfunction of this system in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). While initially proposed to act as a hormone, secreted into the circulation from enteroendocrine cells, recent work has raised questions as to whether this is an important mechanism of endogenous GLP-1 action. In fact, GLP-1 circulates at low levels and is rapidly inactivated by specific enzymatic metabolism. Emerging information suggests that blood borne GLP-1 may not account for many of its actions. We have recently observed an important effect of GLP-1 receptor activity in the fasting state when plasma levels are very low and unchanging. These studies, in mice and humans, suggest a role for ?-cell GLP-1 to regulate insulin secretion as a paracrine factor. This is currently an underdeveloped area of research, but has the potential to dramatically change the understanding of the incretin effect and physiology of GLP-1. Given that there is already a solid base of therapeutics based on GLP-1, new mechanistic understanding could be rapidly translated into clinical application. This proposal will  take up the issue of fasting/paracrine GLP-1 action by addressing the following specific aims: 1. Determine the roles of fasting GLP-1 concentrations and alpha-cell secretion on insulin release; 2. Determine the role of basal GLP-1 action on the ?-cell response to insulin resistance; 3. Determine the role of basal GLP-1 action on fasting glucose regulation in lean, obese, prediabetic, and diabetic subjects. Each of these aims will be conducted in selected groups of human subjects.  The studies proposed herein will use methods of human investigation that we have developed or refined in recent years and take advantage of INDs issued to our group by the FDA to use synthetic GLP-1 and a GLP-1r agonist, exendin-(9-39), in human research. At the conclusion of this project we will have a much clearer picture of how GLP-1 regulates ?-cell function, and the role of fasting GLP-1r signaling and islet paracrine action in this process. A critical aspect of this project is the examination of ?-cell secretion of GLP-1 as central in the  regulation of fasting insulin secretion. In addition, the results of the experiments proposed herei will examine a novel role for GLP-1 in the compensation for abnormal glucose metabolism. We will connect the findings from studies of healthy subjects made insulin resistant with parallel measures in diabetic and prediabetic subjects. These related hypotheses are driven by the goal of optimizing the GLP-1 system as a means of improving metabolic control. Overall, the outcomes of this project will be beneficial to the broad swath of diabetic patients currently needing better treatment, both inside and outside the VA system.',\n",
       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Suicide prevention is a top VHA priority. Suicide prevention in every health system is hampered by difficulties with predicting the risk of suicidal behavior, due to low base rates leading to very low positive predictive values. Very recently, machine learning regression tree methods have succeeded in better identifying a group at particularly high risk of suicide post-discharge from military hospitals. This advance is greatly needed, since the first months to year post-discharge has been repeatedly shown to be one of the very highest-risk periods for suicide that is known. Nevertheless, suicide and suicidal behavior risk prediction post-discharge (and at any other time) is still extremely challenging. For instance, this study's Principal Investigator has found that, in the relatively recent past, a large majority (73%) of VHA  patients with depression denied suicidal ideation even when asked within 7 days of their suicide death. A clear need exists to develop measures of suicidal behavior risk that are not heavily dependent on patient self-report. Recently, our Co-Investigators conducted nonlinear dynamic analysis of movement data from non-Veteran inpatients and identified a signal that was correlated more strongly to suicidal ideation than any other characteristic tested. RESEARCH DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of 115-300 Veterans will be conducted to determine if the previously-identified specific actigraphy-based measurements highly associated with suicidal ideation in non- Veterans will predict suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and/or rehospitalizatin in Veterans. METHODS: An analysis of 115-300 Veterans admitted to the Bedford, Massachusetts VAMC acute psychiatry unit will be conducted. The primary analysis will focus upon 75-200 Veterans with current suicidal ideation or recent suicidal behavior (SI/SB) who do not have a primary psychotic disorder, Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's disease, and who are not undergoing alcohol detoxification. A separate analysis will be conducted of 40-100 patients undergoing alcohol detoxification, half with SI/SB and half without SI/SB. Participants will wear a  small, unobtrusive, wristwatch-like actigraph on their nondominant wrist, and complete self-rated and clinician- rated assessments of suicidal ideation, as well as self-rated assessments of the severity of other psychiatric symptoms. A Resiliency Index (RI) will be calculated using nonlinear dynamic analysis of the amplitude of movements over time frames from 6 minutes - 2 hours. These time frames are the periods for which a clear structure to the movement data is evident, with patients with suicidal ideation showing less variation in amplitude than patients without suicidal ideation. If medications given for alcohol detoxification are determined to not interfere with the RI, then a secondary analysis will examine the entire sample of 115-300 Veterans. One Aim will focus upon determining whether the original Resiliency Index or alternative movement data indices, such as one based on the change in the movement data over the hospitalization, predicts the presence and severity of suicidal ideation among Veteran inpatients. This aim will also examine the sensitivity and specificity of the RI for detecting the presence of any suicidal ideation, and of substantial suicidal ideation. (In non- Veterans, the RI showed a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 100% for detecting any suicidal ideation, and 86% and 88%, respectively, for detecting substantial ideation). The second Aim will determine whether the RI predicts subsequent suicidal behavior or rehospitalization over the next 1 month, 4 months, or 1 year after discharge, alone or combined with data about symptom severity, past history, and the present hospitalization. IMPACT: This study will contribute substantially to the VHA's high priority efforts to reduce suicide and suicidal behavior among Veterans. The approach studied here potentially likely particular value for suicidal behavior risk assessment in that it is not dependent on patient self-report of symptoms. This study is strongly supported by the VHA Suicide Prevention Program as a novel and potentially highly beneficial approach to suicidal behavior risk assessment, alone or combined with other readily available information.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current methods for identifying links between an individual's exposure to toxic air pollutants and adverse health outcomes suffer shortcomings of limited temporal and spatial granularity in exposure monitoring and the lack of real-time analysis to establish a causal relationship between an individual's exposure profile and impact on health. The goals of this proposal are 1) to provide researchers with a new tool to better assess the impacts of pollutant exposure to respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and 2) to provide individuals with an inexpensive wearable device for real-time reporting of exposure data for personalized alerts and managed care services. In the long term, a significantly improved medical understanding of air toxics would allow more relevant regulation of toxic air pollutants and more effective personal prevention plans. To achieve these goals, we propose to explore several key technologies and approaches that will enable implementation of a novel wearable, autonomous, sensor array microsystem for acute multi-pollutant exposure assessment, with real-time monitoring of toxic gases and volatile organic compounds, initially targeting SO2, NOx, CO, ozone, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene, and o-nitrobenzene. The proposed exposure assessment microsystem will integrate into an inexpensive thumb-sized device with all of the sensing, signal conditioning and data analysis necessary to overcome the limitations of existing air pollution instruments. These groundbreaking capabilities will be accomplished through innovations including 1) systematic design across all layers of the sensor microsystem to uniquely achieve desired system attributes, 2) development of new, miniaturizable, ionic liquid electrochemical sensors, 3) incorporation of multi-mode electrochemical techniques to enhance analytical information content, enabling sensitivity improvement, automated drift calibration, and sensing of diverse pollutants with a small number of physical sensor elements, and 4) design of computationally efficient sensor array processing algorithms for real-time classification and quantification of target analytes. This project will pursue the following specifc aims: Aim 1: Develop and characterize a miniaturized electrochemical sensor array for detection and quantification of multiple air pollutants, Aim 2: Develop compact, energy efficient, instrumentation electronics and heterogeneous sensor array processing algorithms to enable an autonomous wearable microsystem, Aim 3: Integrate and characterize a model multi-pollutant electrochemical microsystem and benchmark its performance in the field against standard exposure assessment equipment. Through a combination of accuracy, reliability, small size, low power, real-time measurement, and autonomous operation, the proposed system will provide revolutionary capability to individual exposure monitoring and the study, treatment, and prevention of health impacts of acute exposure to air toxics. Our highly skilled, multidisciplinary team has expertise in electrochemical sensor interface design and characterization, integrated microarray and microelectronic instrumentation development, and exposure assessment and health effects of air pollutants.\",\n",
       " \"Osteoporosis (porous bone disease) is a disease of the skeleton that can have debilitating effects on many US veterans. An estimated 44 million Americans, or 55 percent of the people 50 years of age and older, are currently at risk for osteoporotic fracture. Improved treatment options for the disease require a greater understanding of the cellular events and signaling pathways that control bone metabolism. The proposed research capitalizes on human diseases that result in very high bone mass. The genetic causes of these high bone mass diseases?craniotubular hyperostosis, sclerosteosis, van Buchem's disease?provide insight into how bone mass can be manipulated in osteoporotic patients to improve their skeletal health and prevent fractures. Many of the high-bone-mass associated diseases are caused by mutations in a cell signaling pathway called ?Wnt.? Thus, manipulation of the Wnt pathway holds great promise for skeletal health improvement. This pathway is particularly attractive as a therapeutic target because it can be manipulated to increase new bone formation, rather than simply prevent further bone loss (which is how all but one of the currently available FDA-approved therapies work). The long term goals of the proposed project are twofold: first, we seek to understand how the secreted inhibitors of Wnt signaling function as a coordinated unit (i.e., a milieu), by adjusting their expression levels when other members of the unit are adjusted (e.g., inhibited or deleted). Those adjustments in expression in the members of the milieu represent prime targeting opportunities to enact large changes in anabolic action in bone, as our supporting data suggest. We also seek to understand how this Wnt inhibitor milieu controls the anabolic action of mechanical loading?a potent anabolic stimulus that has lasting benefits to the skeleton. We seek to understand whether certain members of the inhibitory milieu function as ?homing signals? to ensure that new bone is added where it is needed most ? to the high strain regions of the bone, and that it is not added where it is not needed ? to the low strain regions of the bone. Again, our data suggest that the Wnt inhibitory milieu plays a significant role in this process. Our second goal of the application is to conduct functional studies targeting the Wnt inhibitor milieu, that have direct applicability to future therapeutic approaches in patients. Bone wasting conditions such as mechanical disuse (e.g., bedrest, paralysis) and glucocorticoid therapy (a drug used for treating inflammation and immuno- suppression) are common among veterans. Based on measurements we and others have made regarding the changes in expression of Wnt inhibitors following disuse and glucocorticoid exposure, we hypothesize that the ?compensatory milieu? of four Wnt inhibitors?Sost, Dkk1, sFrp4, and Wise?coordinate via unknown mechanisms to prevent anabolic action in the presence of disuse glucocorticoid therapy. We propose to target the entire milieu in different combinations, to determine whether we can restore anabolic activity in mice exposed to these bone wasting conditions. If so, those studies would have far-reaching implications for the design of therapies aimed at treating veterans with disuse- and glucocorticoid-induced bone deficiencies. Another functional study we will undertake, which also capitalizes on the biology of the Wnt inhibitor milieu, is to determine whether we can reduce the dose/volume of Sost antibody required to generate a significant anabolic response by additionally blocking accessory Wnt inhibitors that are part of the compensatory milieu. We have already shown that we can dramatically increase the anabolic efficacy of Dkk1 antibody if we use it in the presence of Sost inhibition. We anticipate a significant osteoanabolic effect using much lower doses of antibody if we simultaneously block other accessory Wnt inhibitors. In this renewal Merit application, we address these questions in order to identify new ways to improve bone health among the veteran population, and among the public in general.\",\n",

Our well characterized unique cohort of FHR adolescents/young adults that were extensively phenotyped between 2003 and 2008 is uniquely suited to address these goals. We published one predictive model each for the emergence of psychopathology with 80% accuracy (sensitivity 0.5, specificity 0.92, positive likelihood ratio 6.25, negative likelihood ratio 0.54), and for psychosis with 88% accuracy (sensitivity 0.17, specificity 0.99, positive and negative likelihood ratios 17 and 0.83, respectively). Our goal is to call back 75 FHR subjects from this cohort (?75%) and examine the validity of these predictions with real-world outcomes of psychosis, broad psychosis spectrum psychopathology and cognitive impairments by including more refined baseline variables and genetic vulnerability using genomewide polygenic risk score and variants of complement gene C4. Independent lines of evidence recently showed association of C4 variants with schizophrenia risk at genomewide significance and increased synaptic pruning. The broad range of outcomes are examined within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework using dimensional changes in working memory and executive function constructs. We will also build a predictive model and a long range multimodal risk calculator for outcome incorporating the real world outcomes to improve sensitivity and positive likelihood ratio while preserving higher specificity and prediction accuracy, elucidate dimensional changes in working memory and executive function, and test these predictions in a replicate sample of FHR from the Edinburgh High Risk Study, which is the largest in the world (aim 1). Using a ?top-down? approach, we will examine how the psychopathological outcomes and dimensional changes in working memory and executive function map on to neural circuitry with hippocampus as a hub. Ultra-high field (7 Tesla) structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI will examine hippocampal subfields and subdivisions, anatomical circuitry, and functional changes to the working memory and executive function tasks (aim 2). We will also derive preliminary outcome biotypes that may be biologically more meaningful for future validation. On successful completion of the project, our data is likely to provide useful leads to long-term biologically-based dimensional phenotypic outcomes of FHR subjects as well as for broad psychosis spectrum psychopathology and cognitive impairments. Identification of such outcomes may provide fundamental biobehavioral constructs for novel treatment designs. Such a long-term follow up of a richly phenotyped FHR individuals has not been attempted, to our knowledge.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This proposal describes experiments designed to understand the mechanisms involved in the control of recovery from bacterial infections. To recover from an infection and return to homeostasis, the host must activate mechanisms capable of controlling the damage caused by pathogen virulence factors, inflammation, and a potentially toxic antibiotic exposure. Failure to properly recover from infections manifests in the form of recurrent infections, inappropriate wound healing, autoimmune diseases, and chronic inflammatory disorders. The mechanisms involved in pathogen recognition and immune activation have been very well studied, but the cellular and systemic responses involved in recovery after an infection is cleared are not well defined. We have established a Caenorhabditis elegans model of acute infection and antibiotic treatment for studying biological changes during the resolution phase of an infection. We found that genes that are markers of innate immunity are downregulated upon recovery, while genes involved in xenobiotic detoxification, redox regulation, and cellular homeostasis are upregulated. Using gene expression profiling, in silico analysis, and reverse genetic approaches, we have linked to the control of recovery from infection to the function of conserved transcription factors, including th GATA transcription factor ELT-2, the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, and the Nrf transcription factor SKN-1. The proposed experiments will explore the general hypothesis that neural GPCRs and cell non-autonomous signals from different neurons may act on non-neural tissues to regulate recovery from infection at the organismal level. Given the conserved nature of GPCR-mediated signaling and the conservation of the transcription factors involved in the control of recovery, the proposed studies should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms used by metazoans to control recovery from bacterial infection at the whole animal level.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          A decade ago, (pro)renin receptor (PRR) was cloned as a new component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with the capability to bind prorenin and renin to increase their catalytic activity. Soluble PRR (sPRR) is derived from the extracellular domain after cleavage by furin or ADMA19. Within the kidney, PRR is predominantly expressed in the collecting duct (CD) where its expression is elevated by AngII. Preliminary studies employing a novel PRR decoy peptide PRO20 demonstrated that intramedullary antagonism of PRR in rats produced remarkable attenuation of AngII-induced hypertension, renal medullary ?-ENaC expression, and kidney injury, in parallel with suppressed renal medullary renin response and urinary aldosterone excretion. Strikingly, after adrenalectomy, this treatment suppressed urinary aldosterone excretion to undetectable level in AngII-infused rats, indicating a dominant role of PRR in nonadrenal aldosterone synthesis in the kidney. In vitro studies provide strong evidence for a direct action of PRR/sPRR in regulation of ENaC activity and aldosterone release from cultured CD cells. Based on these results, we hypothesize that during AngII infusion, PRR expression is increased in the CD where it triggers the local renin/aldosterone response, leading to ENaC activation and hence hypertension. To define the functional role of PRR in the CD, we propose to produce CD-specific deletion of PRR and study its impact on AngII-induced hypertension, target organ damage, local renin/aldosterone response, and ENaC activation in vivo and in vitro. We employ intramedullary infusion and conditional gene targeting techniques to evaluate the contribution of CD ENaC to AngII-induced hypertension. Lastly, we will evaluate urinary sPRR as a biomarker and further study the functional role and mechanism of sPRR in regulation of CD Na+ transport and blood pressure. The current proposal is expected to offer new insight into the role of CD PRR in the pathogenesis of hypertension and kidney injury.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Here, we will determine if improved small molecules can protect the microtubule associated  protein tau from a pathogenic cascade caused by the molecular chaperone Hsc70. Tau accumulates  in  traumatic  brain  injury  (TBI),  leading  to  neurodegeneration  and  cognitive  deficits.  Active  Hsc70  binds  to  tau  just  after  microtubule  disruption  precipitated  by  bast induced  axonal  injury  and  then  directs tau along one of two paths: It either preserves tau, even when it is hyper phosphorylated, in  an effort to recycle it to microtubules, or it triages au for a specialized degradation system called  chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA).  While this seems appropriate in principle, tau is actually a problem for CMA.  It  gets  trapped  in  the  channel  called  LAMP2a,  and  then  it  is  cleaved  into  an  aggregation prone form that can seed further aggregation. So the mechanisms used by Hsc70 to triage tau are ineffective, and the overall outcome is its abnormal accumulation. We have shown that  just by inhibiting Hsc70 with small molecules, tau is sent for proteasomal clearance, which is more  effective  for  clearing  tau  than  CMA.  Therefore  we  predict  that  subverting  tau  away  from  CMA  processing  with  Hsc70  inhibitors  will  reduce  the  pathogenic  tau  burden,  and  could  possibly  be  a  therapeutic strategy for TBI, especially immediately following blast TBI when tau fate is determined.  We also predict that we will be able to use these small molecules to define the mechanism through  which  Hsc70  makes  decisions  about  tau  fate.  Our  team  has  developed  an  extensive  suite  of  compounds  that  reduce  tau  levels  in  cells  through  this mechanism  and  a  number  of  tools  to  investigate  mechanism  of  action.  Therefore,  we  will  be  able  to  evaluate  both  the  efficacy  of  this  approach for in vivo application whilealso dissecting the mechanisms involved in Hsc70 triage of  tau. We have recently shown that Hsc70 inhibition by rhodacyanines can effectively lower tau in cells  and  in  brain  tissue.  This  scaffold  has  been  modified  to  improve  anti tau  potency  and  pharmacokinetics, even permitting BBB permeability. Thus, this compound family could hold promise  as a viable drug candidate for tauopathies. We used this information to create a library of structurally  diverse  derivatives  of  the  rhodacyanine  backbone.  But  we  do  not  know  if  they  have  improved  neuronal anti tau potency or pharmacokinetic profiles. We hypothesize that these properties can be  improved. We propose a step wise advancement process to test the potency, toxicity, efficacy and  ADME/pharmacokinetic profiles of these derivatives. In addition to their potential therapeutic utility,  the rhodacyanines provide excellent tool molecules to examine mechanisms of Hsc70 directed tau  trafficking and turnover. We will also employ innovative cell based assays, shRNA vector screening,  and our developed compound toolbox to clarify how Hsc70 makes tau triage decisions and how they  relate  to  its  pathobiology.  The  proposed  studies  will  hopefully  form  the  foundation  for  a  viable  treatment approach in TBI.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common malignancies among our Veterans. The main goal of this project is to investigate the role of miRNAs in targeting c-Myc/HIF pathway and thus suppress kidney cancer progression and metastasis using both in vitro and in vivo models. The major barrier or clinical challenge is that despite the recent advances in the understanding of the biological basis of RCC, the management of the disease, especially in the advanced metastatic phase, remains a significant challenge. Molecular understanding of pathways associated with kidney cancer progression may lead to better diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic strategies against kidney cancer. Based on the preliminary data and published literature, c-Myc/HIF pathway is involved in the progression and metastasis of kidney cancer. We have identified a set of miRNAs that can target c-Myc/HIF pathway and thus may play an important role in inhibition of kidney cancer progression and metastasis through targeting this pathway. The rationale is that the c-Myc/HIF pathway coordinates complex multifunctional events and has a wide range of downstream targets that regulate tumor-associated cell processes such as cell growth, cell cycle, survival, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in kidney cancer. The role of the miRNA network that regulates the c-Myc/HIF pathway is only beginning to be explored and such studies are lacking in kidney cancer. In this project we will investigate the role of a set of miRNAs in regulation of the c-Myc/HIF pathway that in turn inhibit kidney cancer progression and metastasis. To address this problem, we hypothesize that a set of miRNAs may directly target the c-Myc/HIF pathway and thereby inhibit kidney cancer progression and metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we have proposed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments described under specific aims. Specific Aim # 1. To investigate the mechanisms of miRNA-mediated inhibition of c-Myc/HIF pathway in suppression of kidney cancer progression and metastasis using both in vitro and in vivo models. Specific Aim # 2: To investigate the molecular mechanisms of alteration of a set of miRNAs in kidney cancer. Specific Aim # 3. To investigate whether expression profile of a set of miRNAs can predict clinical outcome of kidney cancer patients. Accomplishment of this project will be a significant step forward in understanding miRNA-mediated suppression of c-Myc/HIF pathway and designing novel miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for inhibition of progression and metastasis of kidney cancer among our Veterans.',\n",
       " 'Although metformin is first line treatment for patients with diabetes (DM), many patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) do not receive metformin due to concerns about the risk of lactic acidosis. Within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 30-40% of incident DM medications are sulfonylureas, rather than metformin, due in part to underlying CKD. Our group and others have demonstrated that among patients with preserved kidney function, metformin use is associated with better cardiovascular, kidney, and survival outcomes compared with sulfonylureas.1-4 The rapidly increasing number of patients with DM and moderate CKD may also derive cardiovascular and renal benefits from metformin, but do not receive this recommended first line therapy due to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning (contraindication at serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL for men; >1.4mg/dL for women). Guidelines in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia emphasize metformin use based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) criteria rather than creatinine. Patients with reduced eGFR may use metformin with frequent monitoring and dose reduction, and an eGFR <30 mL/min is considered an absolute contraindication to metformin. Formal petitions to revise the FDA warning to consider eGFR based prescribing have been filed but additional evidence is needed to inform these policy decisions.6, 7 Randomized trials would be ideal, but the large number of patients needed and existing warning make such studies prohibitive. Methodologically-strong comparative effectiveness observational studies are necessary to determine the relative benefits and risks of metformin versus sulfonylureas use among patients with CKD. This proposal will answer the question: Among patients with Stage 3 CKD, what are the absolute risks of lactic acidosis and cardiovascular and renal events for those initially treated with metformin compared to those treated with a sulfonylurea? We will rebuild an inception diabetes cohort utilizing national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data (corporate data warehouse-vital signs; pharmacy, medical datasets, Medicare/ Medicaid data and vital status files), national death index and data on echocardiograms. Eligible veterans will have a baseline creatinine >1.5 mg/dL or an eGFR between 30 and 59 ml/min and initially treated with metformin (current N=16,891 through FY2008; anticipated rebuilt cohort N~86,924) or sulfonylurea (current N=41,952; anticipated rebuilt cohort N~149,869). The proposed study follows this inception cohort from monotherapy initiation until an outcome or censoring event (leave VHA, change therapy or death). The comparisons of interest will be: metformin vs. sulfonylurea. Persons included are aged >18 years, utilize VHA from 10/1/2000 through 09/30/2014. In this national cohort of veterans with diabetes and impaired renal function: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the risk of hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed lactic acidosis in patients treated with metformin is similar to the risk in patients treated with sulfonylureas. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events is lower among patients treated with metformin versus sulfonylureas. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that heart failure hospitalizations or emergency visits is lower among patients treated with metformin versus sulfonylureas. Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that CKD progression and all-cause mortality is lower among patients treated with metformin versus sulfonylureas. Propensity score matching will be used to achieve similar groups. We will compare event rates accounting for baseline and time-varying covariates with marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models (MSM) with ?stabilized? inverse probability treatment weights (IPTW). Our team has been extremely productive over the last 3 years and is poised to conduct a rigorous and necessary evaluation of the effectiveness of DM regimens among patients with CKD. Our publication record attests to our ability to use VHA data for accurate measurement of exposures, outcomes and covariates.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The candidate's long term goal is to become an independent investigator at an academic research institution to study the effects of hormones and endocrine disrupting compounds on the development and activity of brain circuits. He has received excellent training in neuroendocrinology, neuroplasticity, and behavioral neuroscience. He now plans to complement this knowledge and technical expertise with training in in vivo analysis of the role of endocrine disruptors on neuronal structural plasticity and brain circuit connectivity using targeted manipulation of gene expression via electroporation, time-lapse 2-photon imaging, neuronal reconstruction and structural analysis, electrophysiology and quantification of thyroid hormone levels.  During this training period the candidate will enroll in courses and seminars to improve his management abilities, communication skills and technical literacy.  By the end of this award, he will have gained the skills and training that will be needed for establishing his own lab. He wil also have the publication record and preliminary data on hand to write a R01 proposal with a high likelihood of funding.         Most of the training during the mentored phase will occur at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) under the supervision of Dr. Hollis Cline. Dr. Cline has taken a multidisciplinary approach to studying molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern the development of the visual system in Xenopus laevis tadpoles, including in vivo time-lapse 2 photon imaging, in vivo electrophysiological recordings of visual responses, calcium-imaging and behavior. Her laboratory has been at the forefront of developing exciting new techniques to study the factors that regulate circuit development. Her laboratory is located in the Dorris Neuroscience Center, which is an outstanding intellectual environment consisting of 14 faculty members and more than 100 postdocs and other scientists. Some of the candidate's proposed experiments will benefit from training from a co-mentor, Dr. Ardem Patapoutian, a TSRI faculty member with expertise in biophysics of the TRPA1 channels, which the candidate will use to manipulate neuronal activity.  In addition, the candidate will learn techniques to measure thyroid hormone levels in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Denver at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Dr. Denver is a leading expert in endocrine disruption and physiology and will be an invaluable co-mentor to this project.         The goal of this research project is determine the effects of endocrine-disrupting compounds on brain development. Compounds that are used in the production of industrial and consumer products can accumulate in the environment and even be found in human blood and tissue in measurable quantities. There is increasing evidence that some of these compounds can affect hormone metabolism and action, including thyroid hormone, which plays an important role in brain development. Yet little is known about how environmental toxins that disrupt thyroid hormone function affect development of brain circuits.  The candidate will determine the effects of thyroid hormone disrupting compounds on CNS development, using the visual system in Xenopus laevis tadpoles, an ideal experimental system for these studies because the external development of the animal provides easy access to the developing brains for observation and manipulation.  The candidate will treat tadpoles with the active thyroid hormone triiodothyronine, methimazole (a thyroid hormone antagonist), and several thyroid hormone disrupting compounds. I will assess several parameters of brain development, including neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and survival, and the development of neuronal structure and circuit connectivity. In addition, he will develop and characterize the use of microspheres as a local thyroid hormone delivery system and use this system to target particular hormone treatments to the retina or the optic tectum. These experiments will allow him to disambiguate the site of hormone action within the developing brain and to localize the sites of action and effects of thyroid hormone disrupting compounds on brain development. These will be important advances in the fields of environmental toxicology, neuroendocrinology and brain development. Furthermore, these experiments will establish the Xenopus retino-tectal system as an ideal model to screen thyroid hormone disrupting compounds for effects on brain development.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate's short-term goal is to obtain a faculty position at an academic research institute; her long-term goal is to better understand the nature and molecular underpinnings of tumor-stroma crosstalk in pancreatic cancer, and to harness this improved understanding to treat the human disease. She intends to focus on pancreatic stellate cells, myofibroblast-like cells of the tumor microenvironment, and study how these unique lipid-storing cells interact with tumor cells to effect gene expression, metabolism, and growth. The candidate's background in cancer biology and gene expression analysis will be supplemented by the expertise in high-throughput sequencing and metabolic physiology in the lab and at the present institution to help her realize her goals. Further, the extensive mentorship experience of the advisor and the contributions of a well-balanced mentorship committee will enhance the candidate's scientific and professional development as she transitions to independence. The studies proposed here will evaluate novel mechanisms underlying PDAC tumor-stroma interactions with the following specific aims. Aim 1: Examine the role of stromal VDR/NF-kB crosstalk in PDAC desmoplasia and tumor growth. Recent data suggest that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) negatively regulates PSC activation, leading to reduced expression of pro-inflammatory genes in PSCs and decreased paracrine induction of factors that support tumor growth, by inhibiting NF-kB chromatin occupancy and target gene expression. The role of stromal VDR/NF-kB crosstalk will be examined in patient-derived PSC lines and in a new allograft model of PDAC featuring prominent desmoplasia. These experiments will determine the significance of these factors in the activation of key pathways known to regulate pancreatic cancer cell growth and metabolism. Aim 2: Understand the effect of PSC secreted factors on cancer cell lipid metabolism. Using recently developed systems for analysis of tumor-stroma crosstalk, the candidate will interrogate the link between lipid metabolism and gene expression, in the context of PSC secreted factors. Preliminary data suggest that PSCs secrete factors that foster the recently established fatty acid scavenging phenotype of Kras- transformed cells while providing signaling modulators that impact the availability of acetyl-CoA as a substrate for histone acetylation. The results from these studies will be useful in understanding the unique metabolic properties of PDAC cells. Aim 3: Evaluate paracrine regulation of redox homeostasis by PDAC stromal cues.  The contribution of structural and diffusible features of the tumor stroma will be assessed in tumor cells faced with cellular stress relevant to the tumor microenvironment.  These studies will help to define the nature of paracrine pro-survival pathways that contribute to redox balance in the neoplastic compartment, and that may serve as new therapeutic targets. Together, the proposed experiments will probe previously unexplored aspects of PDAC biology, with the potential to uncover novel vulnerabilities for therapeutic intervention.\",\n",
       " 'Lung cancer is a critical health care problem among Veterans, who have a higher incidence and worse outcome. Most individuals with lung cancer die of their disease because of drug resistance, invasion and metastases, features closely linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs). Importantly, this resistant phenotype includes targeted agents (e.g., EGFR inhibitors), conventional chemotherapy, radiation, and escape from immune destruction by upregulation of PD-L1. The identification and therapeutic targeting of molecules contributing to the aggressive and resistant properties of lung cancer cells are key to tumor cell eradication and cure. Recently, we discovered that TGF?-mediated EMT involves upregulation of the cell surface receptor, Neuropilin-2 (NRP2). Importantly, NRP2 knockdown inhibits TGF?- mediated migration, invasion, metastasis and tumorsphere formation, a feature of CSCs. More recently, we discovered that TGF? induces the preferential translation of a previously uninvestigated isoform, NRP2b, which is identical to the prototype NRP2a in its extracellular domain, but diverges substantially before the transmembrane segment to encode a distinct, yet highly evolutionarily conserved, C-terminus. Our studies demonstrate that NRP2a and NRP2b have opposing effects on tumorigenesis, with NRP2b specifically promoting tumorigenesis, as well as signaling from the receptor tyrosine kinase, MET. The isoforms also differ in their binding to the PDZ domain protein, GIPC1, which is specific to NRP2a, and which is also known to function in receptor endocytosis and trafficking. Importantly, mutations that disrupt NRP2a-GIPC1 binding do not result in NRP2b-like activities, whereas C-terminal deletions of NRP2b attenuate its ability to enhance migration. These results suggest that the NRP2b C-terminus is critical to its pro-tumorigenic properties, which may result from differential interactions or trafficking of cell surface receptors, including MET. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of how NRP2b functions has therapeutic implications. This may come from identifying which cooperating receptors are most important, or elucidating the mechanisms by which NRP2b affects receptor trafficking, thus suggesting new therapeutic strategies. Aim 1 will use genetic approaches to further examine the role of MET in NRP2b function and tumorigenesis, as well as determine if NRP2 isoforms differentially interact with MET, or affect its endocytosis, trafficking and recycling. In addition, we will examine patient samples for co-expression of NRP2b along with markers of MET activation and EMT. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the effects of NRP2b on MET can be generalized to other receptors. Their contribution to NRP2b function and tumorigenesis will be examined. In Aim 3, we will use site-specific mutagenesis and domain swaps to identify critical residues in the 93 amino acid NRP2b C-terminus (JM, TM and cytoplasmic segments) responsible for its distinct activity. The JM segment is unique, extracellular and predicted to be antigenic. We will make monoclonal antibodies against this segment and test them for specificity and inhibitory activity. NRP2b represents a highly innovative avenue of research, which can be exploited for therapeutic gain. In addition, EMT plays a major role in inflammation, fibrosis and normal development, where the role of NRP2b is unknown. Thus, our proposed studies should have broad applicability to lung cancer and other human diseases.',\n",
       " 'Abstract    An effective TB vaccine remains an elusive goal. The success of BCG in preventing disseminated TB suggests  that it is possible to provide complete protection from pulmonary TB or TB infection through an immunization  strategy.  However, the vaccine induced responses elicited by the most recent MVA85A phase II vaccine trial  were modest and of limited durability compared to BCG. The immune responses induced in a preferred vaccine  should also be superior to those observed using BCG alone. Currently, there is no such TB vaccine available,  and few groups have the combination of technologies now proven in the clinic to produce such a platform.  This  innovative program makes major advances in new DNA adaptive EP + gene adjvuant vaccine technology which  in the clinic generates T cell immunity equivalent or superior to live viral vector vaccines1,2.  We will build on our  recent  clinical  success  by  newer  genetic  adjuvants  focused  on  improved  T cell  and  antibody  induction.  We  concentrate on increasing the breadth of coverage induced by these designed DNA vaccine by exploring the  potential  of  a  multivalent  DNA  vaccine  targeting  multiple  Mtb  antigens  at  both  active  and  latent  stages  of  TB  infection. Furthermore, we plan to develop this collection of technologies in a simplified vaccine scheme that has  distinct clinical advantages for global testing. There are three aims that comprise this program to address these  issues. ',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           This application is a competitive renewal for 4 years of funding which extends earlier work conducted during the previous grant period. In this application we will enhance our understanding of the neurobiology of white matter changes in schizophrenia by introducing novel tools and methods that are more specific with respect to underlying pathology. This work is highly relevant to the overall VA mission, as patients with schizophrenia utilize 40% of the VA healthcare resources. Historically, the role of white matter in schizophrenia has been largely overlooked, with the majority of biological hypotheses focused on abnormalities in gray matter. This is despite the fact that schizophrenia is now viewed as a dys-connection syndrome, and that it is white matter that provides long-range communication among neurons. Only recently, with the introduction of diffusion MRI (dMRI), has attention slowly shifted to investigating the roe of white matter in schizophrenia. Nonetheless, findings to date have not led to an understanding of the etiology or to new pharmacological treatment(s), primarily because dMRI measures are nonspecific to underlying microstructural pathology. New methods, however, are more specific with respect to pathology, and based on our preliminary data using free-water derived from dMRI, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we hypothesize that white matter in schizophrenia is compromised by at least two distinct pathological processes that occur at different stages of the disease, i.e., neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Here we will use novel tools and methods to identify the neurobiological nature, time course, and functional consequences of specific changes in white matter in schizophrenia. Specifically, we will use several recently developed MRI acquisition and analysis methods, and apply them to both early onset schizophrenia and chronic schizophrenia populations, as well as to matched healthy controls. In terms of biological hypotheses, we predict that: A) early onset schizophrenia is likel associated with pathology (neuroinflammation) affecting extracellular volume observed using dMRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicators of neuroinflammation; B) chronic schizophrenia is likely associated with increasing cellular pathology (neurodegeneration), observed using dMRI and MRS measures; and, C) both neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration have an effect on axonal conduction transmission speed, evinced using an interhemispheric transfer task, and localization of these changes will predict clinical profile. Longitudinal changes will also be evaluated one year later in the early psychosis patients in order to determine progressive changes in white matter over this time period. The investigation of dMRI, MRS, and EEG methods in schizophrenia will lead to novel findings of white matter abnormalities in schizophrenia, including new information about the role of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative processes that occur at different stages of the disorder, which, in turn, will provide a new perspective on possible treatment interventions that will likely involve anti-inflammatory agents early in the course of illness.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Exposure to a traumatic event that causes extreme fear, horror or helplessness can lead to anxiety disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can often be co-morbid with depression. Female Veterans who experienced Military Sexual Trauma (MST) are particularly at risk for a wide range of trauma- related mental and physical health problems including PTSD, depression, anxiety, chronic pain, sleep disturbances, substance abuse, wide-ranging physical symptoms, and negative health behaviors. Individual patients can vary in the degree to which they present with the different symptom clusters, such that a one size fits all treatment is often inadequate. This individual variation may be associated with biological risk factors that increase vulnerability to the disorder or impede treatment. While neurobiological factors (e.g., hormones, genomics) interact to increase an individual's risk of developing PTSD, it is unclear how the underlying neurobiology is shaped by these factors to result in the observed dysregulations. PTSD is marked by impaired cortical control of the limbic system, specifically the amygdala and hippocampus. Fear conditioning approaches have provided robust brain-based phenotypes of PTSD risk regardless of trauma type, as it is observed in both civilian and combat PTSD populations. The proposed study will capitalize on this observable marker and individual variability among women with MST to investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of PTSD as well as the utility of this phenotype to predict treatment response. Using state-of-the art molecular-genetic approaches with a mechanistic understanding of fear circuitry will offer tremendous insight into individual differences in risk and resilience to traum. Fear responses will be observed using a validated fear-potentiated startle paradigm that allows investigators to assess the acquisition, extinction, and return of conditioned fear responses. Hormonal contributions to heightened fear responding will be investigated by measuring estrogen variation in the female Veteran population to be included in this study. The ADCYAP1R1 gene, which codes for the type 1 receptor (PAC1) for pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is one of the leading candidate genes related to PTSD in traumatized women. This genetic polymorphism was identified using a hypothesis neutral genomic convergence approach, but has since been replicated in several different PTSD study populations. The proposed project will include the examination of PAC1 genotype, methylation status, mRNA expression, and estrogen variation on PTSD symptom expression as well as laboratory measures of fear and anxiety in an understudied population of female Veterans. Lastly, we will evaluate the predictive nature of the neurobiological indices to be included in the  proposed work as they relate to PTSD treatment outcome within the Trauma Recovery Program at the Atlanta VAMC.\",\n",
       " 'The proposed study is a cross-sectional and longitudinal, repeated measure, case-control multi- site study of Veterans with a history of OEF-OIF combat exposure. The purpose of this research is to examine the potential late-life effects of mTBI including possible neurodegenerative disorders such as CTE. The overall goals of this proposed large, longitudinal cohort study of Veterans with and without mTBI after OEF-OIF combat exposure are to (1) disentangle the role of mTBI(s) in their later life outcomes including but not limited to neurodegeneration, and (2) seek converging behavioral and biological evidence for CTE. The facilities engaged in recruiting and enrolling participants are McGuire VAMC in Richmond, James Haley VAMC in Tampa, South Texas Veterans Health Care System in San Antonio, and Michael DeBakey VAMC in Houston. To achieve these aims, all subjects will undergo an initial comprehensive assessment to determine the prevalence, type, and intensity of residual symptoms and impairments potentially attributable to TBI. Individuals with a history of TBI will be compared to controls with combat exposure and no history of TBI. All subjects will then undergo periodic (three years follow up and then every five years), in-person and annual telephonic reassessment to monitor the status of their condition and to assess for evidence of biologic, behavioral, cognitive, neurologic, and functional changes. In this way, the functional and biologic late effects of mTBI and their potential neurodegenerative decline over time will be delineated. In addition to descriptive statistics, the cross-sectional study will assess the association of mTBI and time from injury to current status while adjusting for multiple covariates including age and PTSD. The testing of differences between mTBI and controls will be powered by the primary outcome, cognitive function. Other outcome measures were assembled to measure all potential moderators of mTBI outcome and to track longitudinally the broad range of potential biologic markers, symptoms, impairments, comorbidities and disability known to be associated with TBI outcome and those purportedly linked to neurodegeneration. Physiologic, anatomic, and biologic tests posited to identify preclinical neurodegeneration will be conducted in parallel with cognitive testing; physical and sensory performance measures; and psychological, functional, disability, and global outcome measures. Criteria for participation This study of 1,100 combat-exposed OEF-OIF Veterans is expected to yield approximately 880 participants (80%) with at least one mTBI and 220 participants (20%) without any history of mTBI (referred to as controls). The inclusion criteria are (1) a history of OEF-OIF combat tour, and (2) a Combat Exposure Scale (CES) score > 1 on any item (light or higher). Thus, to ensure that cases and controls have similar environmental history, all participants will have exposure to stressful combat situations during OEF-OIF. All persons regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity will be included. Those with history of moderate or severe TBI, or other major neurologic disorder, will be excluded.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Tobacco use and prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are significantly higher among veterans than non-veteran population. Airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling is the most critical process in the pathogenesis of COPD. Large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are released from activated inflammatory cells and other lung cells in COPD or from tobacco smoke (TS) per se. ROS are implicated in the development of airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling. However, little has been known about how ROS and TS lead to these pathological alterations. We have found that ROS and TS activates calpain in bronchial and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (BSMCs and PASMCs) and that calpain mediates cell proliferation and collagen-I synthesis in PASMCs. Calpain is a family of calcium-dependent non- lysosomal neutral cysteine endopeptidases that act via limited proteolysis of substrate proteins in mammalian cells, including BSMCs and PASMCs. We have recently reported for the first time that global inhibition of calpain prevents pulmonary vascular remodeling induced by chronic hypoxia and monocrotaline. In preliminary experiments, we found that the specific calpain inhibitor, MDL28170, prevented ROS-induced increases in cell proliferation and protein levels of collagen-I in BSMCs and PASMCs. Transforming growth factor (TGF)/Smad pathway have been shown to play important roles in airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling. We have reported that calpain activates TGF1 by cleaving latent TGF1. This proposal is to study a novel hypothesis that calpain mediates ROS- and TS-induced cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in airway and pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells via activation of intracellular TGF1 in TS-induced COPD. The protein and activity of calpain, cell proliferation and collagen synthesis will be determined in BSMCs and PASMCs with or without treatment of H2O2 and TS. Calpain activity will be manipulated using specific inhibitor, siRNA and over-expression of calpastatin genes. A novel intracrine TGF1 pathway will be studied in H2O2- and TS-treated cells. Moreover, the role of calpain in airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling will be evaluated in a COPD animal model using innovative inducible global and smooth muscle-specific calpain knockout mouse line. Finally, calpain will be pharmacologically targeted using a specific calpain inhibitor MDL28170 in a TS-induced COPD rat model. This proposal is novel because it will identify calpain as a mediator in airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling and calpain serves this role by activating intracellular TGF1 in BSMCs and PASMCs. A better understanding of the mechanistic insight will provide a strong rationale for manipulating calpain activities in the treatment of lung diseases such as COPD, pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. Completion of this project will help find novel treatments for COPD and in turn improve the life and care of veterans.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV) are human oncogenic herpesviruses that cause a wide variety of lymphomas and malignancies of epithelial and endothelial origin. Lytic reactivation from latent infection and expression of lytic cycle genes ar important in pathogenesis of both viruses. While viral factors important for replication have been extensively studied, major gaps exist in our knowledge of host factors that control KSHV and EBV reactivation. We have shown that cohesin and CTCF, two cellular proteins that bind to chromatin and modulate transcription, potently repress KSHV lytic replication and virus production. Cohesin is removed from the KSHV genome when it begins to replicate and depletion of either CTCF or cohesin leads to widespread de-repression of KSHV gene transcription. CTCF and cohesin are chromosome remodelers that mediate DNA looping and three-dimensional changes in conformation. Based on these known functions of CTCF and cohesin, we hypothesize that they impose topological constraints on KSHV and EBV circular latent genomes that prevent efficient transcription and DNA replication until they are removed.  In contrast, a select subset of KSHV genes is poorly expressed when cohesin or CTCF is depleted. Many of these genes have promoters with paused RNA pol II, a characteristic of promoters that are positively regulated by cohesin. This cluster of KSHV genes also encodes proteins that have unique immunoevasive and growth promoting functions. Several of them are immunomodulatory and act as viral cytokines that blunt the host antiviral response. Others downregulate surface molecules on KSHV-infected cells rendering them less prone to cell-mediated immune recognition. These proteins are rapidly expressed early during primary infection. We hypothesize that KSHV utilizes cohesin and CTCF to efficiently express these particular genes early in infection and reactivation.  We first propose to expand our studies to EBV, thus establishing these cohesin/CTCF regulatory mechanisms as a general paradigm for host control of gammaherpes virus reactivation. These mechanisms will be confirmed and characterized in unique EBV-infected cell lines from patients with mutations in the cohesin pathway. We will determine the molecular mechanisms by which cohesin and CTCF inhibit KSHV transcription and the extent to which they directly inhibit the physical process of viral DNA replication. We will investigate the molecular pathways by which cohesin is removed from latent viral genomes to permit lytic replication - systematically studying the role of proteins that modif cohesin and load and release it from human chromosomes. Compounds that inhibit removal or enhance loading of cohesin will be employed to validate these pathways as therapeutic targets. Finally, we will define the contribution of cohesin and CTCF to KSHV's ability to express immune evasion genes. We will determine the extent to which depletion of CTCF and cohesin impairs KSHV immune modulator expression and function. We will confirm these findings by constructing and characterizing KSHV mutant viruses which cannot bind cohesin and CTCF at the immunonomodulatory gene locus and the origin of replication. This multi-faceted approach to investigating host control of KSHV and EBV should yield many novel insights into the host-pathogen balance in the broad areas of viral reactivation and immune evasion.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background/Rationale: HIV-1 infection and its prevention are of particular importance to the health of veterans, with 1 out of 250 veterans known to be HIV-1 infected. Prevention of HIV-1 was specifically mentioned as one of the 3 main goals in President Obama's National HIV/AIDS Strategy in 2010, as well as the Department of Veterans Affairs National HIV/AIDS Strategy Operational Plan in 2011. Our group has focused on a preventive vaccine for HIV-1 through study of potent antibodies directed at HIV-1. A limited number of persons infected with HIV-1 develop circulating plasma antibodies able to potently neutralize a wide variety of HIV-1 isolates representing different genetic subtypes. It is widely held that the characteristics and specificitis of such antibodies can be used to guide the development of HIV-1 vaccine candidates capable of eliciting protective humoral immunity in a target population. Current methods for study of these antibodies include isolation of antibodies from memory B cells, which may not always reflect the antibodies circulating in the blood. Our research has focused on the identification of characterization of the broad neutralizing antibodies directly from patient serum (without potential bias of selection), as neutralizing antibody characteristics seen in multiple individuals are more likely be raised in a broad population. We have noted particular biochemical signatures that point to a common dominant, acidic epitope that is targeted on the envelope of HIV. Objectives: The specific hypothesis of this proposal is that the broad HIV-1 neutralizing response in plasma is due to a shared acidic epitope on the gp120 envelope. The specific aims of the project are to 1) Directly isolate and sequence the antibodies responsible for the broad neutralization from the plasma of HIV-1 infected individuals, and 2) Map the corresponding epitope(s) of the broad neutralizing antibodies to test the hypothesis that a shared acidic epitope of gp120 is responsible for the broad HIV-1 neutralization response. Methods: We have identified 10 patients with broad neutralization, of which 3 will be studies in detail. The affinit purification (antigen, subclass, and light chain specific) and fractionation (free-flow isoelectric focusing) scheme can narrow the antibodies of interest, directly, from the plasma to individual species. These species will be tested for broad neutralization. Upon confirmation, the individual antibody bands will be sequenced de novo using both LC-MS and Edman degradation (N-terminal and internal sequencing). Epitope mapping of the new mAbs will be undertaken with Elisa, mutagenesis studies, and X-ray crystallography. Once the epitope is identified, Elisa and mutagenesis studies will be used to test the active fraction on the other 7 individuals to determine if this epitope is responsible for broad neutralization. Findings: Anticipated results wil be isolation of new mAbs, identification of common characteristics of broadly neutralizing abs, and the identification of a common acidic epitope that can direct broad HIV-1 neutralization. Status: We have completed enough work on the techniques described herein (as well as each alternative plan) to ensure that the aims are feasible and will be completed. Impact: If our hypothesis proves correct, then the results will be novel and directly applicable to the study of HIV vaccines. This study will provide a deeper understanding of possibilities of the broad HIV-1 neutralizing response in humans, and it will also have identified a naturally occurring epitope(s) that can be the target of potent cross-clade antibodies against HIV-1. This will have an impact on the designs of an HIV vaccine, which when developed will improve the health of veterans by preventing this life-long disease.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is a global health problem. Treatment of drug-susceptible TB involves months of therapy with multiple potentially toxic antibiotics. Treatment of TB has become even more difficult by the emergence and increasing prevalence of multi-drug resistant M.tb. This proposal focuses on the development of a novel therapy that targets M.tb iron (Fe) acquisition, a process that is critical to its ability to cause  disease. Ga(NO3)3 is a FDA- approved drug for treating hypercalcemia of malignancy. It interferes with cellular Fe metabolism by competing with Fe for uptake/use. We find that Ga also decreases M.tb Fe acquisition, inhibits growth of both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant M.tb strains growing in vitro extracellularly and within human macrophages. Ga also demonstrated efficacy in murine models of M.tb infection. Intermittent systemic delivery of Ga(NO3)3 for a few days has shown minimal toxicity in humans. However, treatment of TB would likely require more sustained treatment regimens. Ways to improve targeting of Ga to infected macrophages, extend dosing intervals, or avoid systemic administration would improve Ga's therapeutic index. There have been considerable advances in recent years in the aerosol delivery of drugs to the lung, as well as cellular targeting of nanoparticles to accomplish these goals. Therefore, we hypothesize that Ga delivery by aerosol or nanoparticle to the lung could prove to be novel, well-tolerated, and effective therapies for TB that would work via disruption of M.tb Fe metabolism. In order to test the above hypothesis we propose to accomplish the following specific aims: 1. Identify forms of Ga that exhibit maximal in vitro potency against extracellular and intracellular M.tb, including MDR- and XDR-TB, with the goal of arriving at lead compounds. 2. Develop formulations of two lead Ga compounds that will allow them to be administered by inhalation for the treatment of pulmonary TB and determine their biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and efficacy in murine models of pulmonary TB. 3. Develop nanoparticle formulations of two lead Ga compounds that will allow them to be administered for the treatment of pulmonary TB and determine their biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and efficacy in murine models of pulmonary TB. 4. Determine mechanisms of action of the lead Ga formulations against M.tb, potential for emergence of resistance, and effect of the presence of other TB drugs on Ga anti-mycobacterial activity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: Human monocyte-derived macrophages and murine models of TB will be employed along with fully virulent strains of M.tb. The work will emphasize: Fe and Ga acquisition by M.tb: Ga biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, toxicity; and potential bacterial target for Ga antimicrobial activity. Experimental methods employed include: development of Ga formulations suitable for aerosol or nanoparticle-mediated delivery; bacterial uptake of radiolabeled Fe and Ga, growth of M.tb in vitro and in vivo, murine models of pulmonary TB, quantitation of Ga in tissues. POTENTIAL IMPACT ON VETERAN HEALTH CARE: Veterans are at high risk for pulmonary TB. This work could lead to development of novel treatments for TB that would benefit veterans.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing in prevalence and affects more than 20 million individuals in the United States, and is especially common among veterans. Some causes are well known, such as diabetes and hypertension, and current management remains similar to two decades ago and consists of blood pressure control, blood sugar control, and blockade of the renin angiotensin system. More recently, we find that CKD is developing in people before they develop diabetes and hypertension, such as in subjects with metabolic syndrome, and also is developing in almost everyone as we age. Furthermore, once we have CKD, progression of kidney disease tends to continue despite our best efforts. It seems like there must be some other risk factor that has not been identified. In this proposal we present a novel hypothesis that our western diet may be driving subtle kidney disease in everyone. Specifically, we suggest that a little-known enzyme in the kidney proximal tubule, known as fructokinase, may be driving much of the current CKD epidemic. Fructokinase is an enzyme that metabolizes fructose and in the process causes intracellular ATP depletion, oxidative stress, and an inflammatory response. Diets high in sugars containing fructose can cause acute and chronic kidney disease in rats, likely due to metabolism of fructose in the proximal tubule. Recently we found that fructose can also be generated from glucose in the proximal tubule when the enzyme aldose reductase is induced, and preliminary studies suggest this may have a role in diabetic and nondiabetic CKD and also in aging-associated CKD. We therefore hypothesize that low grade fructose metabolism by fructokinase in the proximal tubule is the missing link that explains why CKD is increasing, why CKD is associated with metabolic syndrome, why CKD is occurring with aging, and why kidney disease progresses in subjects with preexisting CKD. To test these hypotheses, we will do the following studies. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of fructokinase in the CKD associated with aging and metabolic syndrome, and will also determine if CKD is accelerated by simple sugars containing fructose, sucrose, or glucose compared to complex carbohydrates. Models will include normal mice and mice with metabolic syndrome (Pound mouse) that either express fructokinase or have fructokinase systemically absent. Aim 2 will determine if fructokinase has a role in the renal progression that occurs in established CKD and whether it is accelerated by simple sugars via this mechanism. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that it is renal fructokinase that is driving aging-associated CKD and the progression of kidney disease in established CKD using mice in which fructokinase is selectively deleted from the kidney. If successful, these studies will identify a novel mechanism driving CKD that could be as important a factor as hypertension and diabetes themselves. Furthermore, our studies should be able to determine if altering the composition of simple sugars in the diet can influence progression. These discoveries could therefore lead to both dietary measures, as well as potentially new treatments to prevent CKD in veterans and others living in western cultures.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, a consequence of organ preservation and implantation, adversely impacts both early and late outcomes after heart transplantation. As heart failure is highly prevalent among the veteran population, this area of investigation is of very high significance. While neutrophils are critical mediators of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, little is known about their trafficking and activation requirements during this form of sterile inflammation. Utilizing our newly developed technique of intravital imaging of beating mouse hearts, we have uncovered a role for innate immune molecules in donor hearts for entry of neutrophils into the graft tissue of freshly reperfused cardiac transplants. This application proposes to study mechanisms for neutrophil recruitment during myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury of heart grafts and will allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cancers of the renal cortex are known as renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and represent ~80-85% of all primary renal neoplasms. The clear cell variant comprises up to 85% of all RCCs, which are expected to result in ~64,000 new cases and ~14,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2014. Clear cell RCC is a disease that increases with age and is more common in men, and as such represents a common source of cancer-related morbidity and mortality amongst our Veterans. The disease is lethal at the advanced, metastatic stage. Although several novel treatments, including small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and rapamycin analogs, have received regulatory approval, their overall impact on survival is modest, and median survival for patients with metastatic clear cell RCC remains at only ~24 months.  The molecular hallmark of hereditary and sporadic clear cell RCC is the biallelic inactivation of the vonHippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, which is most well characterized for its role as the substrate recognition unit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF?) for proteasomemediated degradation. Importantly, upwards of 90% of sporadic cases of clear cell RCC manifest VHL inactivation. Although restoration of the expression pVHL, the protein product of the VHL gene, suppresses tumorigenesis as does inhibition of HIF? expression, gene replacement therapy and the development of small molecule inhibitors of transcription factors such as HIF? s not readily feasible for clinical translation. The overarching goal of our proposed research is to validate HIF?-independent effects of VHL loss as viable therapeutic targets for clear cell RCC. Specifically, we propose to generate the pre-clinical data to establish that a MAP kinase kinase kinase known as transforming growth factor ? activated kinase (TAK1), which is hyperactivated in response to pVHL deficiency, is a suitable target for drug development and translation into the clinic. We have already established that TAK1 drives the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) pathways, both of which are pro-tumorigenic and constitutively activated in pVHL-deficient RCCs. Thus, our hypothesis is that TAK1 inhibition represents a potential therapeutic target that mediates renal oncogenesis through downstream activation of the NF-?B and JNK pathways. Based on this background and our preliminary studies, many of which have been published, we have proposed three aims:  Aim 1. To establish that TAK1 inhibition prevents and retards the growth of pVHL-deficient RCCs in vitro and in vivo.  Aim 2. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that are permissive for concurrent, constitutive activation of the NF-?B and JNK pathways in pVHL-deficient cells.  Based on preliminary studies, we postulate that molecular adaptations acquired by pVHL-deficient RCCs are critical to the ongoing, constitutive JNK activation that characterizes pVHL-deficient cells.  Aim 3. To establish that constitutive TAK1 and concurrent NF-?B and JNK activation occur in clear cell RCC patient specimens. As a critical component to the process of pre-clinical validation of a molecular target, it is vital to confirm that the relevant pathways ar indeed activated in patient specimens in a fashion that is consistent with our pre-clinical models. Successful execution of the proposed aims will lay the groundwork for the validation of TAK1, a druggable kinase that is hyperactivated as a consequence of VHL loss, as a molecular target for clinical development. In this fashion, our long-term goal is to translate our findings to the management of advanced clear cell RCC, a relatively common malignancy amongst our Veterans.',\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         More than 1,500,000 individuals in the US are diagnosed with cancer every year. Cachexia (defined as an involuntary weight loss due to adipose tissue and skeletal muscle loss), and anorexia (decreased food intake) are present in up to 80% of these patients, contributing to the decrease in functional performance, quality of life and survival seen in this setting; however, treatments for this condition are lacking. Ghrelin is a novel anabolic hormone that increases energy intake and decreases energy expenditure and inflammation leading to an increase in muscle and fat mass; although, its mechanisms of action in the setting of cancer cachexia are not fully understood. To this date, the only identify receptor for ghrelin is the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR-1a) and this receptor is not present in muscle or adipose tissue. Recent data has shown that some of ghrelin's effects are GHSR-1a-independent. The objectives of this proposal are to characterize the mechanisms of action of ghrelin and GHSR-1a agonists in muscle and adipose tissue and to establish the extent to which these mechanisms are GHSR-1a-dependent in cancer cachexia. We hypothesize that ghrelin ameliorates cancer cachexia by inducing: 1) GHSR-1a- dependent increases in appetite, GH/IGF-I and downregulation of inflammation, and 2) GHSR-1a-independent decreases in proteolysis by acting directly on muscle cells. We also hypothesize that ghrelin increases lipogenesis and downregulates lipid oxidation and lipolysis in tumor-induced cachexia through GHSR-1a- dependent and independent mechanisms. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine the role of the ghrelin receptor GHSR-1a in mediating the effects of ghrelin in tumor-induced cachexia in rodent muscle. Using our already established in-vivo model (Lewis Lung Carcinoma [LLC]-induced cachexia) in GHSR-1a WT and KO mice, we will determine the role of GHSR-1a activation in modulating muscle mass and strength, inflammation, proteolysis and protein synthesis in this setting. 2) To characterize GHSR-1a-independent mechanisms of action of ghrelin in muscle. Based on our preliminary data showing that the GHSR-1a is not necessary for ghrelin to prevent cisplatin-induced proteolysis in C2C12 cells, and that ghrelin partially prevent LLC-induced cachexia in GHSR-1a KO, we will study these effects in- vivo in our LLC-induced cachexia model and in-vitro in C2C12 cells and 1ry myocyte culture from GHSR-1a KO mice. We will characterize the pathways mediating these GHSR-1a-independent effects of ghrelin and perform experiments to identify the alternate receptor responsible for these effects. 3) To establish the role of GHSR-1a in mediating the effects of ghrelin in adipose tissue. As shown in our cisplatin model, we will study the role of ghrelin in preventing fat atrophy induced by LLC tumor and the relative contribution of lipogenesis, lipolysis and lipid oxidation in this setting. Using our GHSR-1a WT and KO animals we will also establish the role of GHSR-1a in mediating ghrelin's effect in fat in-vivo and in-vitro. The development of therapies for the prevention or treatment of cancer-related fat and muscle wasting is desperately needed because they significantly reduce quality of life in Veterans with cancer. The present proposal will provide insight into ghrelin's mechanisms of action, determine which of these effects are GHSR- 1a-dependent and which are GHSR-1a-independent, characterize these two pathways and identify this novel receptor. Taken together, these experiments will determine the mechanisms mediating ghrelin's protective effects in this setting, addressing a clinical need and filling a void in the literature. Ultimately, these results will allow for better targeting of this pathway and the development of novel therapies for this condition. Other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure and frailty of the elderly are also associated with muscle and fat loss and will benefit from the advance in knowledge that this proposal will bring.\",\n",
       " \"?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The persistence of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients is a major barrier to the eradication of this disease. Although combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) is highly effective at suppressing viral production from the latent reservoir, cART withdrawal leads to a rapid viral rebound driven by the reactivation of viral transcription from the latent pool. In this project, we will develop a multi-targeted therapy that we expect will significantly reduce and potentially eliminate the ability of HIV-1 to infect target cells in the absence of cART. This combination therapeutic will target different key aspects of HIV infection, each of which contributes to sustained viremia in the absence of cART. These components include viral particles, virus producing cells, the CCR5 co-receptor expressed on target cells, and the integrated provirus. To clear HIV and HIV-producing cells that emerge during viral rebound, we have engineered a panel of anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies bind to various epitopes on HIV- 1 and have been modified to express functionally enhanced Fc domains. These altered Fc domains promote Fc receptor functions on myeloid cells such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis, and complement recruitment. We have developed CRISPR/Cas constructs that target and cleave the CCR5 gene. CCR5 gene cleavage in the CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population will lead to the differentiation and proliferation of CCR5-negative immune progeny that are resistant to infection with R5-tropic HIV-1. Moreover, CCR5 gene cleavage in differentiated leukocytes will also result in HIV-1 resistance. We have developed CRISPR/Cas gene editing constructs to cleave the integrated proviral sequence, so that infected cells transduced with these genes are unable to transcribe intact viral genomes. To deliver these CRISPR/Cas transgenes, we have developed lentiviral (LV) vectors that we will pseudotype with different viral envelope proteins and anti-receptor antibodies to direct LV to specific target cells. CRISPR genes delivered by LV are stably integrated into the target cell genome so that the transduced cells and their progeny are permanently protected from HIV infection. Typically, each of these approaches would be proposed independently, and efficacy measured against the absence of treatment. However, a key innovation of this application is to combine these approaches into one therapeutic regimen. In the first 3 aims, we will develop and select the most efficacious reagents for each of these approaches using a combination of in vitro cellular assays and in vivo assessments in the HIV-infected humanized mouse (hu-mouse). In Aim 4, we will combine the therapeutics and test them in the HIV-infected hu-mouse model, and determine their ability to suppress and delay viral production following interruption of cART treatment. We expect that these studies will not only develop clinic-ready reagents that will have undergone rigorous testing and validation in a pre-clinical animal model, but we will also demonstrate that combination targeting, like combination anti-retroviral therapy, is more effective than a single therapeutic in reducing the viral burden in HIV patients and in developing an HIV-resistant immune system. This work brings together the combined expertise of Drs. Susan Eszterhas and George O'Toole in the design of CRISPR gene targeting constructs, Dr. Bryan Luikart in the development of LV vectors for primary cell targeting in vivo, Dr. Margaret Ackerman in the optimization of antibodies for therapeutic development, and Dr. Dorothy Wallace in mathematical modeling of human diseases.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         ABSTRACT: Osteoarthritic symptom is the key reason to seek medical assistance, yet there is no effective way to relieve osteoarthritis (OA)-induced pain. Our long term goal is to understand the discrepancy between the degree of cartilage degeneration and the actual experience of joint pain by investigating the neuroanatomical approaches in an experimental OA model followed by validation in human joint tissues. We propose that OA pain sensation can develop independently of progressive cartilage degeneration, and that severity of joint pain is due to cellular and molecular plasticity in the sensory neurons of the innervating dorsal root ganglion and pathological changes in synovium (e.g., synovitis, angiogenesis). We will identify the fundamental factors that facilitate pro- nociception in OA independently of the degree of cartilage degeneration. Our studies will also provide important empirical support for the development of clinical strategies to treat OA symptoms. Our results will provide a novel view of major disease-modified chronic pain mechanisms that accompany degeneration of knee joints in OA. At a broader level, results from this proposal will impact our conceptual perspectives and future research translation by clarifying relationships between musculoskeletal tissue degeneration and debilitating OA symptoms.',\n",
       " '?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans play important roles in many physiological and pathological events, such as cell division, inflammation, neuronal development, and cancer metastasis. Naturally existing HS and CS display a diverse range of sulfation patterns. While this structural diversity bestows HS and CS with the ability to interact with many proteins, it greatly hinders the ability to decipher their structure-function relationships. In order to dramatically advance an understanding of the biological functions of glycosaminoglycans, it is critical to access large, structurally diverse libraries of HS and CS oligosaccharides bearing well-defined sulfation sequences. To date, synthetic methodologies toward HS and CS are mostly target oriented, resulting in only small sets of oligosaccharides. Furthermore, it remains difficult to prepare HS and CS sequences longer than a dodecasaccharide. To address these challenges, three research groups with strong, complementary expertise in HS and CS synthesis and biology have joined forces to accomplish the following aims. In Aim 1, new synthetic strategies are proposed to accelerate the synthesis of HS oligosaccharides. Methodologies will be developed to prepare the first comprehensive library of 256 HS tetrasaccharides representing all of the possible 2-O, 6-O and N sulfation motifs, along with a library of structurally diverse 3-O sulfated tetrasaccharides and HS hexasaccharides. In Aim 2, we propose new efficient, cost-effective routes to access the first comprehensive library of CS tetrasaccharides bearing all of the possible mammalian sulfation sequences. In Aim 3, HS/CS oligosaccharide-based polymers and head-to-tail multimers will be prepared to enable access to structures containing homogeneously sulfated glycans with sizes approaching natural polysaccharides. These mimetics will possess similar domain structures and multivalent properties found in naturally existing CS and HS polysaccharides. In Aim 4, we will validate the hypothesis that our molecules can recapitulate the biological functions of HS and CS polysaccharides using well-established assays, including anticoagulation, neuronal growth, and protein-binding assays. Furthermore, we will explore the potential for these molecules to selectively target a clinically important family of proteins, the fibroblast growth factors. Together, this project will provide faster, more affordable syntheses of HS and CS, greatly expand the chemical space currently accessible by synthesis, enable the first direct, in-depth comparisons between HS and CS, and provide novel agents to control the activities of these biomedically important molecules.',\n",
       " 'Every day, 22 veterans complete suicide, primarily due to the ramifications of untreated depression. Due to fear and stigma, many do not seek treatment. For those who do, about one third of the time, no drug offers relief and even those antidepressants that do work often require 6-8 weeks before therapeutic onset. Unfortunately, no unifying hypothesis for a molecular/cellular basis of action for antidepressant drugs (or depressive disorders) has emerged. Over the last several years, we have suggested that, in addition to pre- synaptic targets (uptake sites), a number of antidepressant drugs have a post-synaptic mechanism of action. Toward this end, we have observed that chronic treatment (3-5 days) of cultured neural or glial cells with a number of chemically diverse antidepressant compounds translocates the heterotrimeric G protein G?s outof lipid rafts and into a closer association with adenylyl cyclase. Post-mortem tissue from depressed suicides shows just the opposite, with an increased proportion of G?s ensconsed in lipid rafts and preliminary data suggest that this is also observed in blood cells, where the extent of G?s in lipid rafts correlates with both depression and clinical response to antidepressants. Furthermore, several experimental compounds may have antidepressant effects as well as shorter therapeutic onset, and the proposed studies will search for a cellular ?biosignature? for antidepressant action. Proposed studies will also attempt to establish a mechanistic understanding for the translocation of G?s from lipid rafts as a hallmark of depression and as a conduit for antidepressant action. During the period covered by this proposal, we will pay particular attention to short- acting antidepressants like ketamine. One intent of the proposed studies is to develop a platform that can provide a cell- based screen for putative antidepressant compounds as well as a screening tool to indicate personalized antidepressant choice. Another intent of these studies is to provide a peripheral tissue biological marker for depression and an early (< 1 week) indicator of successful antidepressant treatment that can be developed into a clinically useful, inexpensive and simple biomarker for clinical use. The identification of a pathway for antidepressant action might lead to novel antidepressant drugs, while the assignation of a quantitative value for depression may help overcome stigma and encourage thousands of depressed veterans to seek treatment.',\n",
       " \"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized pathologically by neuronal loss and the accumulation of aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in surviving CNS neurons. Collectively, these disease, which include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are a common and important cause of progressive neurological disability in Veterans. Current treatments only partially mitigate symptoms and do not alter the course of these diseases; consequently, there is an urgent need for new approaches that address pathogenic mechanisms and prevent disease progression. Convergent genetic and pathological evidence strongly suggests that Tau is centrally involved in causing neurodegeneration in these diseases, and there is accumulating evidence that oligomeric Tau species are a key pathogenic mediator. In addition, human tauopathy tissue and experimental Tau models both show striking evidence of impaired mitochondrial function resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative damage to neurons. However, there is no consensus regarding the mechanisms by which Tau and mitochondria interact and it is not known whether changes in mitochondrial function are a proximate pathogenic event that could be targeted therapeutically. Building on: (i) our recent finding that cytoplasmic protein oligomers  inhibit mitochondrial protein import by interacting with the translocase of the outer mitochondrial  membrane (TOMM) complex; (ii) published evidence showing that oligomeric Tau species are neurotoxic and impair expression of mitochondrial proteins; and (iii) our preliminary data showing that Tau interacts with the TOMM complex in Alzheimer's disease tissue, our overall guiding hypothesis is that: inhibition of mitochondrial protein import by oligomeric Tau causes progressive mitochondrial functional deficits that provoke oxidative damage and neuronal death. To address this hypothesis directly in vivo, we have generated novel zebrafish tauopathy models with progressive and highly reproducible phenotypes, allowing establishment of the sequence of biochemical events underlying pathogenesis over a practicable experimental time course. This model has been constructed on a genetic background that lacks pigment, allowing imaging of CNS neurons in vivo by confocal microscopy. Coupled with novel transgenic zebrafish lines expressing ratiometric reporters of cellular mitochondrial function, we will determine how neuronal mitochondrial bioenergetic functions, ROS production, and cellular RedOx status change during progressive tauopathy the CNS in vivo, and whether abnormal phenotypes can be rescued by over-expression of the translocase complex protein TOM20 (Aim 1). These experiments will test the hypothesis that protein import-dependent abnormalities of mitochondrial function in neurons precede the onset of neurological phenotypes in tauopathy and worsen with disease progression, causing oxidative damage and cell death. Next, in a series of complementary experiments in vitro and in vivo, we will test whether oligomeric Tau competes with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins for interaction with TOM20 to directly inhibit mitochondrial protein import (Aim 2). Finally, exploiting the translational potential of Ta transgenic zebrafish, we will carry out the first phenotype-based drug re-purposing screen in a vertebrate tauopathy model (Aim 3). Using novel, automated neurological phenotyping assays we will interrogate a chemical library against functional endpoints that are caused by tauopathy, but which are unbiased to preconceptions regarding molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis. Compounds that are identified as modulators of tauopathy in vivo in this pilot screen will be tested for activity in restoring mitochondrial protein import and function, and will be candidates for further therapeutic development. Together, these studies will elucidate mitochondrial mechanisms underlying degeneration of CNS neurons in tauopathy in vivo and will provide new avenues of investigation for the development of effective therapeutics.\",\n",
       " 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive scarring interstitial lung disease (ILD) that affects mainly older adults. Recently, a paradigm shift has occurred wherein the concepts of epithelial cell dysfunction and abnormal wound healing have been placed at center stage as mechanisms driving fibrotic lung remodeling offering new opportunities for therapeutic discovery for IPF. Surfactant protein C (SP-C), an alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell-specific hydrophobic protein that enhances the biophysical activity of surfactant phospholipid, has provided an important clue for understanding epithelial cell dysfunction in IPF pathogenesis as the heterozygous expression of over 50 mutations in the SFTPC gene in humans is associated with chronic ILD. During the current funding period we have shown that sequence alterations in the SP-C primary translation product (proSP-C) associated with clinical ILD phenotypes result in either of 2 distinct aberrant cellular expression patterns, each capable of triggering a series of aberrant cellular responses. ILD-associated, aggregation-prone SP- C isoforms resulting from mutations within the distal COOH domain of the SP-C proprotein (termed ?BRICHOS?) produce vigorous induction of an unfolded protein response (UPR), ER stress, and apoptosis. We have also made the seminal observation that SFTPC mutations found in the more proximal proSP-C COOH linker domain (?Non-BRICHOS?) are mistrafficked to the plasma membrane with a secondary disruption of endosomal / lysosomal function. The induced cellular phenotype includes a late block in macroautophagy, impaired mitophagy, and alterations in general proteostasis repertoires. Building on this, the overall goal of this Merit Review renewal is to now use SFTPC mutants as substrates in vivo to identify and translate molecular mechanisms underlying the disrupted cellular quality control and epithelial dysfunction to the pathophysiology of IPF/ILDs. This proposal will leverage a novel mouse model also generated in the current cycle which expresses the disease-causing clinical non-BRICHOS SFTPC mutant, SP-CI73T, exclusively in AT2 cells. Our Preliminary Data reveals that SP-CI73T mice exhibit alterations in normal proSP-C biosynthetic routing, acquire disruptions in AT2 cell autophagy, and develop diffuse parenchymal lung remodeling. Our experimental approach will be to exploit the unique features of this genetic model combined with tools and reagents available in our program designed to interogate cell quality control and integrated stress responses to first define the ontogeny of and cellular mechanisms mediating the aberrant lung injury, repair, and remodeling responses induced by non-BRICHOS SP-C mutations in vivo [Specific Aim 1]. This will be combined with reductionist studies using primary AT2 cell culures isolated from SP-CI73T mice at key time points in the development of the lung phenotype to characterize the biosynthesis and specific AT2 cellular responses to mutant SP-CI73T in vitro [Specific Aim 2]. Finally, to obtain a more complete model of IPF pathogenesis, the effect of exogenous ?second hits? such as oxidative-nitrative stress and infection on the SP-CI73T mouse lung phenotype will be investigated [Specific Aim 3]. As epithelial dysfunction and susceptibility to injury have not been studied extensively in vivo in the context of fibrotic lung diseases, this approach offers the unique opportunity to comprehensively identify mechanisms mediating responses to the mutant SFTPC substrate by AT2 cells, and to assess the pathways promoting crosstalk between AT2 cells, inflammatory cells and fibroblasts that drive parenchymal remodeling. By understanding the path to epithelial injury from mutant SP-C, the mechanisms identified using these systems can be cross-purposed to better understand the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial IPF.',\n",
       " 'Solid organ transplantation necessitates the use of lifelong immunosuppression. In particular, the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are utilized in nearly all transplant recipients as they are potent immunosuppressants. In kidney transplantation, the use of CNIs has led to the very low rejection rates of ~7-10% per year. However, long term graft survival has not improved substantially with their utilization, with a mean half-life of 10 years for kidney transplants. A key contributor to late graft injury is CNI-nephrotoxicity which is manifested by declining kidney function and the histological features of interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and arteriolar hyalinosis. The mechanism by which CNI induce kidney injury and failure is multifactorial, and to date, there are no specific therapeutic strategies to mitigate this injury. The goal of this submission is to identify a novel and clinically applicable strategy to ameliorate CNI-associated kidney injury. Recently, AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cell metabolism, autophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis, has been linked to modulating kidney injury. Further, loss of AMPK activation is associated with organ inflammation and fibrosis. We hypothesize that AMPK activation could ameliorate some of the adverse metabolic consequences in renal tubular epithelium and as a corollary, AMPK activation could be a clinically relevant intervention to mitigate long term CNI nephrotoxicity. Our study will focus on cyclosporine A (CsA), a classic CNI therapeutic agent. We will utilize a complementary series of studies, both in vitro and in vivo, using a mouse model of CsA injury that we have used successfully in our laboratory. In vitro, we will focus on renal tubular epithelium, the primary target of in vivo injury. We will study both the impact of AMPK activation as well as knock down using pharmacologic agents and silencing RNAs. Outcomes will include assessments of bioenergetics, mitochondrial function, pro-inflammatory markers and the DAMP HMGB1, and paracrine impact on macrophages and their differentiation. In vivo, we will test the impact of AMPK activation on ameliorating CsA renal injury by assessing kidney function (serum creatinine), mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators within the kidney, and biochemical, cellular and histologic assessments of injury and fibrosis. We will assess both pre-emptive inhibition as well as determine the impact of AMPK activation after established CsA nephrotoxicity. To complement these pharmacologic studies, we will also employ the novel use of AMPK ?1 and ?2 deficient mice. Cross-transplant studies will allow us to dissect the role of systemic versus renal expression of AMPK in injury. We believe that this comprehensive approach will provide key mechanistic insights into ameliorating or mitigating CNI nephrotoxicity. The use of a clinically relevant activator, metformin, will provide an opportunity for rapid translation into our human recipients of kidneys and other solid organ transplants.',\n",
       " 'Abstract  Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague and has caused widespread loss of human life during three pandemics. Y. pestis is also firmly established in animal reservoirs on nearly every inhabited continent, with the largest reservoir in the southwestern United States. Each year multiple outbreaks occur resulting in 1,000- 5,000 human cases reported worldwide (likely an underestimate). Currently there is not a FDA approved vaccine for plague and the bacterium has a high potential for bioterrorism misuse. Consequently, Y. pestis is considered a Tier 1 Select Agent. In order to grow, Y. pestis must acquire essential biometals such as Fe, Mn and Zn. However, the host restricts access to these metals through nutritional immunity. Therefore, Y. pestis, like other pathogens, has evolved high affinity metal acquisition systems that are essential for virulence. We recently discovered that the yersiniabactin (Ybt) synthetase system not only contributes to Fe acquisition, but also to Zn acquisition in Y. pestis. Furthermore, we have shown that the inner membrane permease YbtX (which is not required for Fe-Ybt acquisition) is required for Ybt synthetase-dependent Zn acquisition. These discoveries have opened a new area in Ybt and Zn acquisition research. Specifically, we hypothesize that Y. pestis produces a Ybt synthetase-dependent zincophore that is distinct from the Ybt siderophore. Furthermore, Y. pestis uses a dedicated uptake system to reacquire this zincophore once bound to Zn. Along with ZnuABC, this new system is essential for Zn acquisition during infection. In Specific Aim 1, we will use a biochemical approach to purify and define the chemical structure and Zn affinity of the secreted Ybt synthetase-dependent zincophore. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of the Ybt synthetase-dependent zincophore to virulence using a hemochromatosis mouse model. Importantly, the hemochromatosis mouse is defective in Fe nutritional immunity. Thus, this model will allow us to separate contributions of Ybt synthetase-dependent Fe acquisition from Ybt synthetase-dependent Zn acquisition to Y. pestis virulence. Finally, as Y. pestis also infects fleas for transmission, we will determine the contribution of Zn acquisition to colonization and survival in the flea vector. Completion of these aims will provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of Zn acquisition in Y. pestis virulence. Furthermore, as Ybt is a conserved virulence factor, this work will also be relevant to other bacterial pathogens that use the Ybt system.',\n",
       " '?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Blood coagulation prevents hemorrhage and also contributes to thrombotic diseases including myocardial infarction, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. A great deal has been learned about blood coagulation on the scale of a test tube, an artery, and a vein. However, the regulation of blood coagulation at the single cell level has been largely unexplored. Under ordinary conditions endothelial cells that line all arteries and veins have anticoagulant properties. However, following injury or stress, endothelial cells develop some procoagulant properties and recruit platelets that respond with promounced procoagulant activity. Our preliminary data demonstrates that stressed or stimulated endothelial cells support assembly of the prothrombinase complex in focal areas on the cell while maintaining anticoagulant proteins on other parts of the cell. They identify TMEM16F as a protein required for normal platlet procoagulant activity. Localization of procoagulant activity is dependent upon regulated phosphatidylserine exposure and convex curvature of membrane regions. Thus our data suggest that stressed, viable endothelial cells can support procoagulant enzyme activity at the subcellular level, assisted by platelets, while maintaining anticoagulant properties. The objectives of this proposal are to characterize the role of TMEM16F with regard to procoagulant activity of platelets and endothelial cells using engineered mice lacking the protein. We will explore the functional consequences of the localized enzyme complexes on endothelial cells and determine whether TMEM16F- mediated phosphatidylserine exposure is also critical there. Finally, we will apply the insights gained to test a novel hypothesis in which focal fibrin deposition, mediated by endothelial cell stimulation, leads to trapping and elimination of many types of bacteria. The results of our studies are relevant to fundamental understanding of the blood coagulation mechanism and its participation in heart attacks and strokes. It is also related to the role of the blood coagulation mechanism in preventing or limiting bacterial infections. Finally, it may also help to explain the relationship of blood coagulation to inflammatory diseases.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY A major limiting factor to the development of successful subunit vaccines against emerging pathogens is the lack of effective and safe immune adjuvants. Biomaterials immunoengineering is a nascent field that is generating promising avenues for the development of subunit vaccines against infectious diseases, cancers, and autoimmune disorders. Peptide based biomaterials are attractive due to their biocompatibility, ability to fold into specific structures, ease of synthesis, and the rich chemistry with which the primary sequence can be manipulated to control the immunomodulatory properties. We are interested in the development of self- assembling peptide biomaterials for applications in vaccine development and immunotherapies. In the current project, we will develop novel self-assembling heterochiral peptide biomaterials that engage mechanisms of autophagy for applications in vaccine development against mosquito-borne flaviviruses such as West Nile (WNV). In aim 1, we will synthesize peptides with various patterns of chiral amino acids and investigate the assembly, morphology, structure, and bulk material properties such as viscoelasticity and proteolytic stability. In Aim 2, we will investigate how chirality-induced changes in the physicochemical properties of peptide biomaterials impact mechanisms of autophagy, adjuvant potency, and antibody responses using model antigens or peptide and protein antigens derived from WNV. We will deliver antigenic peptides or protein domains from viruses via covalent linkage or shear-thinned with peptide hydrogels and investigate antibody responses, affinity, and neutralization capacity. In aim 3, we will test protection from WNV challenge and neuroinvasion in mouse models and assess translational capacity of peptide biomaterials using Japanese encephalitis antigens for which inactivated human vaccines are available to serve as controls. Completion of the proposed work will integrate the fields of biomaterials, chemistry, immunology, and virology for the development of biomaterials-based immunization platforms against not only WNV, but also other emerging flaviviruses of public health importance.',\n",

       "'PROJECT SUMMARY  Our understanding of the genetics of schizophrenia is advancing at a rapid pace and an increasing number of  risk associated  polymorphisms  and  variants  have  been  discovered.  Because  the  majority  of  these  variants  reside  in  intergenic,  intronic  and  other  non coding  sequences,  a  precise  variant  or  target  gene  for  schizophrenia  has  not  been  identified.  Therefore,  a  major  challenge  lies  in  designing  testable  hypotheses  to  elucidate the potential function of disease associated non coding DNA. Many of the risk variants are thought to  affect  gene  expression  through  alterations  of  regulatory  elements,  including  long range  enhancer  sequences  physically interacting with transcription start sites separated along the linear genome of DNA. The aim of this  proposal is to map the regulatory sequences (or open chromatin) in discrete cellular populations (neurons and  glia) derived from two human cortical brain regions in a large cohort of cases with schizophrenia and controls,  followed  by  generation  of  a  high resolution  quantitative  trait  loci  (QTL)  map  of  regulatory  sequences.  In  addition,  high  resolution  expression  quantitative  trait  loci  (eQTLs),  mapped  in  the  same  samples  and  brain  regions,  will  be  leveraged  to  identify  schizophrenia  associated  non coding  regions  that  are  simultaneously  associated  with  differential  exposure  of  regulatory  regions  (open  chromatin)  and  gene  expression  of  nearby  genes (eQTLs). Long range enhancer promoter interactions of genes potentially regulated by open chromatin  sequences will be mapped in human postmortem brain tissue using chromosome conformation capture. Using  the  existing  schizophrenia related  large scale  molecular  data  and  the  high impact,  high resolution,  complementary datasets generated through the proposed studies, we will develop multiscale network models  causally  linked  to  schizophrenia.  The  action  of  individual  genes  on  molecular  and  cellular  schizophrenia  associated  processes  and  the  molecular  networks  identified  in  our  studies  will  be  validated  using  iPS cell  derived  cultures  of  human  neuronal  cell  systems.  The  multidimensional  approach  presented  here  provides  a  roadmap  to  place  schizophrenia  genetic  risk  variants  in  molecular  contexts  to  help  identify  the  underlying  regulatory and expression mechanisms through which they act.

       "\"    Rotaviruses (RVs) are the single most important cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children  worldwide. RV replicates predominantly in mature small intestinal epithelial cells. The young of many  mammalian species are naturally infected with host-specific homologous RV that causes severe diarrheal  disease virtually exclusively in that species. Replication of heterologous RV in the intestine is inefficient and  this `species barrier' has been exploited to develop several licensed and candidate human RV vaccines. The  mechanism for attenuated replication of these vaccines in humans is poorly understood due to lack of proper  human models. Recent studies in a murine model of RV infection using both homologous murine RV and  heterologous non-murine RV strains demonstrate that the failure to inhibit innate immunity by heterologous RV  and restriction of target cell entry on a species-specific basis are the two critical determinants of host-specific  replication in mice. The murine RV gene products most important in circumventing replication restriction are  NSP1 and VP4. The mechanistic basis of modulating host-specific replication restriction involves suppression  of the type I, II, and III interferon (IFN) responses via inhibition of IRF-3, NF-B, and STAT1 signaling by NSP1  and modulation of viral binding to target epithelial cells mediated by VP4. Previous studies have compared  murine and non-murine RV infection in vivo in suckling mice and or murine cell culture but there is currently no  information available to indicate whether or not host-range restriction in humans is mediated by identical,  similar, or distinct mechanisms. In this proposal we will take advantage of a new, highly tractable human small  intestinal organoid system that recapitulates the ability of human intestine to support vigorous replication of  human origin RV strains but substantially restricts non-human origin RV strain replication. We will use this  system and associated powerful single cell analytic tools to identify the genetic and mechanistic origins of RV  replication restriction in people. Our work will expand our understanding of RV pathogenesis, will enhance our  ability to design more effective third-generation RV vaccines and will increase our basic understanding of  innate immunity in the human intestine. The Aims of this proposal are to: 1) Determine the genetic basis of  host-range restriction of non-human origin RV strains in primary human intestinal epithelial cells. 2) Define the  mechanistic basis of host-range restriction of non-human origin RV in the human gut.\""

       "\"       This proposal requests support for the construction of a new satellite animal care facility that will facilitate biomedical research and training. The facility will be located in New York City at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI), a non-federal institution that focuses on clinical and basic research related to a broad spectrum of mental disorders. The proposed facility will provide animal housing and testing space for researchers recently relocated to NYSPI's newest building. In combination with the space freed in the central facility, the new site will yield additional room for the rapid expansion of mouse and primate studies. It will be constructed in 3300 square feet of existing shell space in the Institute's main building. Approximately one third will be dedicated to housing, one third for testing and surgery, and one third for food, bedding, and cage storage, plus common corridors. The facility will be divided into a rat section and a mouse section, each having surgical and general procedure areas, several test rooms, two to three housing rooms, and some rooms of flexible design that can be shifted between testing and housing. Animal husbandry will be minimized by using high-density ventilated cages, an automated watering system, and a vacuum bedding removal system. Dirty racks and cages will be transported through dedicated service hallways and elevators to the Institute's central animal care facility in an adjacent building for cleaning. The design will meet all NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and health and safety regulations for staff.        \""
