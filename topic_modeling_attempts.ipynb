       "[' Students heavy drinking has been described as \"by far the single most serious public health problem confronting American colleges\". This research aims to facilitate development of improved alcohol abuse prevention programs for fraternity men. Specifically, this research seeks to evaluate the impact of two national fraternities\\' alcohol abuse prevention programs, and to examine associations between changes in theoretical alcohol consumption determinants and reductions in alcohol consumption levels among fraternity men. The first year of this research will utilized a matched pair, randomized pre-post design to measure the impact of prevention activities in 10 fraternity chapters, compared to 10 delayed intervention control chapters. Sixty chapters will participate in years two and three of the investigation. Impact will be assessed in terms of reduction in alcohol use as well as changes in hypothesized alcohol behavior determinants such as: perceived collective efficacy of the chapter in moderating excessive alcohol use, alcohol consumption expectancies, and the perceived norms regarding alcohol use. The primary statistical procedures used to analyze program impact on these measures will be analyzes of covariance with modifications to account for the nested design of fraternity members within chapters. During the second and third years of the investigation, past analytic models illustrating the causal pathways of these variables in moderating drinking levels will be theoretically created and then tested using structural equation modeling techniques.

       " 'The cell physiology of addictive mechanisms involves seven- transmembrane receptors and their initiated signalling pathways. The phenomena of withdrawal and dependency have been correlated with the expression of cAMP signaling pathway components in several brain nuclei. Three primary elements play sequential roles in this pathway; receptor, G protein and adenylyl cyclase. I will test the hypothesis that mutations in the contact regions between proteins in this pathway can result in better coupling than wild-type. Bacterial screening mechanisms capable of selecting gain-of- function phenotypes from large, randomly mutated libraries will be used to identify mutations that augment binding between signaling molecules. This screening system has been constructed and previously implemented in this lab. Particular mutations that augment coupling will yield information about the structural characteristics of optimal adenylyl cyclase activating ligands, leading insight to therapeutic design. Bacterial without endogenous adenylyl cyclase cannot metabolize maltose. Transformation of bacteria with adenylyl cyclase and G protein has been shown to allow growth, with growth rate being dependent on the efficiency of coupling between the expressed molecules. A simple extension of this constructed pathway will include the expression of a G protein coupled, seven-transmembrane receptor in the inner-membrane of E. Coli, allowing for quick drug screening and efficient mutational analysis of the receptor. ',\n",
       " \"Interactions between dopaminergic and cannabinoid receptors in the basal ganglia have only recently been elucidated. The basal ganglia regulate movement, and when there is substantial cell death in centers in the basal ganglia, profound motor dysfunction can result. Of great importance is the neurodegenrative Parkinson's disease, in which a majority of the dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in the basal ganglia have degenerated. Although research on Parkinson's disease has been dominated by investigations of the role of dopamine in basal ganglia nuclei, current researchers and clinicians are implicating roles for other receptor systems in these nuclei. Therapy for this disease primarily involves drugs that enhance dopaminergic transmission; however, clinicians have also used other classes of drugs to alleviate symptoms in these patients. These other classes of drugs work on different receptor systems and may enhance dopamine release. This research proposal involves an investigation of a nondopaminergic drug and its potential effects on alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Because cannabinoid agonists cause a rigid immobility in rats mimicking Parkinson's disease, a cannabinoid antagonist might alleviate some of the symptoms of this disease. Recent evidence suggests that a cannabinoid antagonist might enhance dopamine transmission and antagonize cholinergic activity in the basal ganglia. Thus, a cannabinoid antagonist may cause a positive therapeutic effect in Parkinson's patients. To test this, a dopaminergically compromised rat and a primate MPTP model of early stage Parkinson's disease will be used to determine the therapeutic potential of a cannabinoid antagonist. In addition to behavioral studies in whole animals, the biochemical interactions between cannabinoid and dopamine receptors in these nuclei will be investigated. Using dissected rat and primate basal ganglial nuclei, receptor co-localization and signal transduction convergence will be elucidated. Adenylate cyclase and [35S] GTP-gamma-S binding assays will be used to determine maximum activity, drug-drug additivity and interactions between one receptor system and another. With these studies, dopamine and cannabinoid interactions will be elucidated and the potential for a new class of therapeutic agents for Parkinson's disease will be determined. \",\n",
       " 'Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are an increasingly popular substance of abuse among adolescents, as well as elite athletes. The actions of AAS in the central nervous system are poorly understood, however, recent studies in rodents indicate that AAS induce rapid and reversible modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor-mediated currents in neurons of forebrain regions of both prepubertal and adult animals. Moreover, the ability of AAS to modulate currents in the forebrain is region- specific and depends on receptor subunit composition. The expression of GABAA receptors comprising different subunit isoforms is heterogeneous throughout the brain and regulated both in a region-specific and developmental manner. Therefore, understanding differential AAS modulation of GABAA receptors composed of different subunits establishes the essential groundwork for understanding the actions of AAS in the central nervous system. The cerebellum is an ideal system for allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors because the cell-specific patterns of expression of different subunits and the functional modulation of GABAA receptor-mediated currents by other modulators have been well characterized, especially in Purkinje and granule cells. In addition, the cerebellum is the essential structure in mediating motor memory and motor coordination, both of which may be affected during AAS. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques of neurons in acutely isolated brain slices, the ability of specific AAS to induce different patterns of modulation upon inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in Purkinje cells and granule cells of postnatal rats will be determined. Second, to correlate, at the single cell level, significant differences in the ability of AAS to modulate GABAergic IPSCs with cell-specific patterns of subunit gene expression, single cell RT-PCR will be used to detect the ratio of subunit families expressed. Finally, using ultrafast perfusion patch-clamp technique on recombinant GABAA receptors expressed in transfected cells, the subunit dependence of AAS IPSC modulation will be determined. ',\n",
       " 'Although substantial evidence exists for the activity-dependent release of VIP in the CNS, its effect on synaptic function is poorly described. Within the hippocampus, VIP is expressed exclusively in GABAergic interneurons, suggesting that GABA and VIP may inhibitor postsynaptic responses in concert. VIP stimulates the cAMP PKA pathway via VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors. Moreover, GABAR beta subunits are substrates of PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Interestingly, our preliminary findings indicate that agents capable of increasing PKA-mediated phosphorylation, including VIP, can restore in vitro GABAR function in the hippocampal CA1 region of benzodiazepine tolerant rats. Using newly available VIP receptor antibodies we propose to describe the anatomical distribution of VPAC1 and VPAC2 in the hippocampus, their overlap with GABA receptors, and the cross-talk between VIP and GABA receptor proteins. We propose, that 1) VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors reside on CA1 pyramidal cells at sites postsynaptic to VIP containing interneurons; 2) VPAC1 and or VPAC2 co-localize at these synapses with subunit phosphorylation. These studies are of broad interest as VPAC1 and VPAC2 distribution in the rat CNS, with particular respect to postsynaptic GABA receptors, has not been described. Moreover, elucidating VIP and GABA-ergic interactions may reveal opportunities for the treatment of a variety of GABA receptor dysfunctions, including benzodiazepine tolerance. ',\n",
       " 'There are several important reasons for studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of repeated psychostimulant administration. First, abuse of psychostimulants such as cocaine is a major medical and social problem. Studies suggest that the neurophysiological adaptations associated with repeated psychostimulant administration contribute to drug craving. Second, the cellular changes underlying repeated psychostimulant administration are a form of neuronal plasticity. Studying the psychostimulant-induced neuronal adaptations will shed more light on the mechanisms of neuronal plasticity in general. Third, studying the molecular adaptations associated with psychostimulant exposure will help us to understand the neural mechanisms that lead to subjective experiences such as pleasure and pain, one of the most fascinating problems in the field of neuroscience. Growing evidence indicates that the neurotrophin family of growth factors plays an important role in the effects of psychostimulants. BDNF and NT-3 microinjections into the VTA have been shown to enhance the behavioral activating effects of cocaine. The goal of the research outlined in this proposal is to expand on these findings by studying the role of BDNF and NT-3 receptors, trkB and trkC respectively, in cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization. Specifically, this will be accomplished in the following two stages. First, rats will be injected with acute and repeated systemic injections of cocaine and levels of trkB and trkC protein in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) will be measured. Second, trkB and trkC receptors will be up-regulated and down-regulated in the VTA using sense and antisense recombinant adenovirus vectors. Following virus treatment, rats will be given acute and repeated systemic cocaine injections. Subsequent behavioral activity will be measured and the VTA will be excised to test for changes in tyrosine hydroxylase activity as a measure of cocaine-induced neuronal plasticity.',\n",
       " 'Understanding the mechanisms of drug addiction is a major goal of modern neurobiology. At the heart of the problem lies an alteration in the dopaminergic neuromodulatory system. The hippocampus is a region of the brain that has been implicated in drug reward circuitry, and is heavily innervated by ventral tegmental dopaminergic terminals. Recently, much attention has been devoted to voltage-gated ion channels in the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, yet little of this attention has focused on its possible importance. In drug addiction. My preliminary evidence suggests that voltage-gated ion channels in CA1 neurons can undergo plastic changes following synaptic conditioning., which is a particularly interested phenomenon considering that alterations in intrinsic excitability of neurons have been reported in nucleus accumbal neurons following psychostimulant sensitization. In this proposal the goal is to understand how plasticity of dendritic intrinsic conductances could contribute to the neuroadaptation seen during drug addiction. Specifically, I plan to explore acute and chronic dopaminergic modulation of CA1 pyramidal dendritic function using both in vitro and in vitro pharmacological manipulations. ',\n",
       " \"(Adapted from applicant's abstract): We are investigating the molecular basis for substrate recognition and inhibitor action in neuropeptidases. These enzymes play key roles in the generation and inactivation of peptide neurotransmitters and hormones. A better understanding of these enzymes and the development of specific inhibitors may permit novel therapies for psychotic disorders, pain, and drug and alcohol addiction. We study one enzyme, neurolysin, as a model system. Like a number of the neuropeptidases, it is active only on short peptides, and it is able to recognize a diverse but specific set of cleavage sites. This enzyme is known to control the levels of neurotensin, which is one of the most potent analgesics known and is thought to play a role in schizophrenia and depression. Our group has determined a crystal structure of neurolysin, which is a 78kDa zinc metallopeptidase. We now plan to determine crystal structures of the enzyme complexed with peptides and inhibitors to determine the basis for the unusual aspects of its substrate recognition. This structural work will be complemented by a series of functional studies aimed at better defining the features of a good substrate. And finally, we will compare the mechanisms of substrate recognition and inhibitor binding with those of a neuropeptidase from a different enzyme family \",\n",
       " \"This application proposes a five year educational program at Baylor College of Dentistry, Texas A and M University System (BCD) for Mr. David Erik Kern. This program will combine Ph.D. studies in Biomedical Sciences with concurrent clinical training leading to a D.D.S. Mr. Kern's ultimate goal is a career in dental research and academic dentistry. His research interests are directed toward cartilage development and the genetic basis for chondrodysplasias, craniofacial abnormalities, and other genetic defects in human cartilage and bone development. A tentative research proposal is outlined, that will be modified as Erik begins the research component of the training. The research will address hypotheses concerning the cell-extracellular matrix interactions that are important for chondrocyte survival, proliferation and terminal differentiation. In previous work my group developed an organ culture model in which chondrocytes recapitulate normal development in their natural microenvironment. We have previously shown that sterna cultured with blocking integrin antibodies have decreased growth, survival, differentiation, and type X collagen secretion. This project builds on the previous work to further characterize the effects of cell-matrix interactions on collagen and other secreted protein synthesis and mRNA expression. Erik will specifically ask: How is type X collagen down regulated when cell-matrix interactions are blocked Are other collagen (II, IX or XI) expression or synthesis affected by blocking cell-ECM interactions with integrin antibodies Do other matrix proteins or molecules (cartilage matrix proteins, proteoglycans, or annexin V) change expression or synthesis in presence of blocking integrin antibodies Do integrins themselves change expression or synthesis in the presence of blocking antibodies Techniques will include maintaining whole cartilage in organ culture, immunoprecipitation, Western Blots, RNA extraction, Northern Blots, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy. \",\n",
       " 'Activation of neuroendocrine responses by stress has been shown to suppress anti-viral immune responses, including natural resistance mechanisms and adaptive immunity. For example, elevated plasma corticosterone (Cort) levels, arising from activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, have been shown to suppress mononuclear cell trafficking and cell- mediated immunity. In addition, increased tissue and circulating catecholamines (CAT), due to activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), suppress activation of virus-specific CD8+ T-cells. Recent studies have shown that stress can also suppress activation of natural killer (NK) cell function during an influenza viral infection, and that the mechanism of suppression is independent of Cort or CAT. In preliminary studies, the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone has been shown to block stress-induced suppression of NK activity during an influenza A PR8 viral infection, suggesting that opioids may play an important immunomodulatory role in the resistance to viral infection. As it has been shown that opioids can modulate NK cell function, and that stress can activate opioid responses, this project was designed to investigate the immunomodulatory role of endogenous opioids during an acute viral infection of the respiratory track. An animal model of influenza will be used to dissect the mechanism by which opioids modulate NK responses. ',\n",
       " \"The field of tissue engineering has developed due to the inadequate supply of organs and tissues for patients requiring organ tissue replacement. An attractive alternative to organ and tissue transplantation that could immensely expand clinicians' ability to treat patients requiring new organs and tissues is the selective transplantation of the appropriate cell type(s). Transplanting cell populations on biodegradable polymer matrices in order to engineer a functional tissue mass from these transplanted cells is an intriguing strategy. However, the survival of these cells is dependent on diffusion of nutrients and waste products between the transplanted cells on the matrix and the vasculature existing in the surrounding host tissue. Currently, this vascular network is the limiting factor in allowing the engineering of large-scale masses of tissue capable of forming whole organs. The proposed research focuses on strategies to increase the vascular network within these polymer matrices in order to create significant amounts of bone tissue capable of replacing osseous defects. The specific aims of this proposal are: Aim 1-To define strategies to engineer microvascular endothelial cells to produce growth factors mediators that a) will induce a vigorous and sustained angiogenic response, and b) will induce bone development and growth from osteogenic precursors. We will initially look at the mediators Bcl-2, angiopoietin (two potent inducers of angiogenesis), and the osteogenic mediator BMP-2; Aim 2- To incorporate these different endothelial cell populations into biodegradable polymer matrices and to test their individual and combined abilities to form capillaries in vitro and in vivo; Aim 3- To determine the baseline bone formation when osteo-progenitor cells are transplanted on a biodegradable matrix; Aim 4-To determine if an appropriate combination of endothelial cells, osteo-progenitor cells, and matrix, as determined in Specific Aims 1-3, will result in a sustained and vigorous angiogenic response in vivo (SCID mouse model) capable of supporting bone development from osteo-progenitor cells. \",\n",
       " 'Wound healing is a vital physiologic process aimed at reestablishing the integrity of the integument. Activation of the neuroendocrine system by stress has been shown to alter the kinetics of wound healing. Recent studies suggest that stress- induced disturbances of the neuroendocrine equilibrium may provoke alterations in the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines and growth factors that are important in angiogenesis. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting vessels, is essential for the repair, remodeling, and regeneration of damaged tissue. Suppression of pro-angiogenic growth factors may decrease the rate of the neovascularization of granulation tissue, prolonging the proliferative and remodeling phases of wound healing. The purpose of this study is to describe the interrelationships between the neuroendocrine responses, growth factor gene expression, and wound healing in a murine model of restraint stress. We hypothesize that gene expression of the pro-angiogenic growth factors VEGF, FGF-1, and FGF-2 is altered by restraint stress, resulting in slower neovasculaturization of the wound tissue. An elevated level of corticosterone is the underlying factor that contributes to a delay in the neovascularization of the healing wound in restraint stressed animals. ',\n",
       " \"The objective of this study is to investigate the regulation controlling the expression of DMP-1 during odontogenesis. The regulational investigation of DMP-1 will be carried out on immortalized odontoblasts and ameloblasts. The potential function of the DMP-1 protein will be tested using transgenic mice over expressing DMP-1. Our Hypothesis is that the tissue and developmental expression of DMP-1 is regulated through discrete interactions of transcription factors with their cognate cis-elements and that DMP-1 has an important function in normal tooth mineralization. In order to test this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be met. 1. Determine the conserved cis-elements present in the DMP-1 promoter that potentially regulate this gene's expression pattern. 2. Determine the region of the DMP-1 promoter that confers the tissue- specific expression of DMP-1 gene during odontogenesis in vitro using immortalized cell lines and transgenic mice. \",\n",
       " 'Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are associated with chronic and debilitating pain. These far too common disorders, affecting up 15% of American adults, are often resistant to traditional therapies effective for pain treatment in other areas of the body, possibly reflecting unique properties of primary afferent neurons innervating the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Furthermore, there is an increased prevalence and severity of TMD pain in women versus men. Epidemiological, clinical, and animal experimental evidence suggests that estrogen may contribute to the pathophysiology of TMD pain. Therefore, we propose to test the hypothesis that estrogen increases the excitability of trigeminal primary afferent neurons innervating the TMJ Pain associated with TMD may also reflect TMJ inflammation. In the presence of inflammation, primary afferent neurons become sensitized, displaying spontaneous activity and or a leftward shift in the stimulus- response function. Therefore, we also propose to test the hypothesis that estrogen exacerbates the inflammation-induced sensitization of primary afferent neurons innervating the TMJ. To test these hypotheses, we will perform experiments described under the following Specific Aims. ',\n",
       " ' (provided by applicant) Wound healing is an important physiologic process aimed at the restoration of tissue continuity following injury. Activation of the neuroendocrine system by stress has been shown to alter the kinetics of wound healing by increasing serum glucocorticoid levels. This elevation in the level of glucocorticoids is the underlying factor contributing to the impaired healing seen in wounds of restraint stressed animals. Studies suggest that elevated glucocorticoid levels may provoke alterations in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines important in the early phases of wound healing. Recent studies suggest that androstenediol (5-androstene-3beta, 17beta-diol, AED) may reduce the immunosuppressive action of glucocorticoids during stress and preferentially augment the production of cytokines necessary for inflammation and resolution of infection. The purpose of this study is to describe how AED will counteract the glucocorticoid-mediated immunosuppressive effects of stress during wound healing. We hypothesize that the health adverse effects of highly elevated GC will be reduced by pharmacological treatment with AED.',\n",
       " 'The long-term objective of this study is to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie or direct endochondral bone development, using the formation of specific digit elements as a model for studying this process. Our lab has recently identified a brachydactyly mouse mutant (bdy[tg]) showing fore- and hind-limb digit loss. This mutation, generated by transgene insertion, has provided a means to identify, a new skeletogenic factor and to study its interaction with known bone regulators such as BMPs, Wnts, Ihh, PThrP; and Gli transcription factors. Given the conservation of signaling networks used for both endochondral bone formation and tooth development, what we learn by examining digit development should be important for understanding both skeletogenesis and development and maintenance of dento-alveolar structures. The bdy gene has been identified as the type IB bone morphogenetic protein receptor, BmprIB, and is required for formation of a digit cartilage template. Two major classes of transcripts arise from the BmprIB locus. Rather than representing alternative splice variants from a single promoter, the two isoforms are products from two BmprIB promoters: one located distally, driving expression in the developing limb skeleton, and one situated proximally, initiating transcription in neural epithelium. This proposal addresses the following questions: (1) What are the key cis-regulatory elements required for BmprIB expression in developing limb skeletal mesenchyme (2) What are the transcription factors that bind these cis-elements To address these questions, the following specific aims are proposed: (I) Delineate cis- regulatory elements required for expressing BmprIB in the limb. (II) Identify transcription factors that bind these required cis-elements. ',\n",
       " ' (provided by applicant) The sympathetic nervous system contributes to certain types of chronic pain states such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Many studies have evaluated sympathetic modulation of nociceptors utilizing animal models of hyperalgesia that typically involve a peripheral nerve injury. These studies have demonstrated that NPY, a sympathetically derived neuropeptide, provides an important although highly complex neuromodulatory function after peripheral nerve injury. However, few studies have evaluated NPY modulation of nociceptors under control or \"in-injured\" conditions, which is the broad objective of this research proposal. We believe that understanding how NPY functions under basal conditions is critical to understanding how it functions in response to injury. The specific aims are: 1) to characterize the pharmacological effects of NPY receptor agonists for modulating the initiation of neurogenic inflammation; 2) to determine whether NPY receptor agonists inhibit capsaicin-evoked hyperalgesia following administration to the rat dental pulp; 3) to evaluate the molecular basis for NPY pharmacology by identifying specific NPY receptor subtypes expressed on the capsaicin-sensitive class of trigeminal sensory neurons and 4) to evaluate the effects of nerve injury on specific aims #1-3.

AR also undergoes autoregulation, a process by which androgens regulate AR mRNA transcription and AR protein stability. This action may be a mechanism by which cells can alter their responsiveness to androgens. My sponsor and others have shown that AR mRNA levels may correlate with androgen sensitivity. Industrial chemicals and the so-called \"environmental endocrine disruptors\" may interfere with androgen-mediated activities. The increasing incidence of human male genital tract malformations, male infertility, and female breast cancer may be due in part to antiandrogenic effects of these compounds. Studies suggest that two such chemicals, DDE (a metabolite of the pesticide DDT) and M2 (a metabolite of the fungicide vinclozolin) inhibit AR DNA-binding and the subsequent transactivation of target genes. Also, other laboratories have found that these chemicals may possess agonist activities, especially at high concentrations. This proposal seeks to assess the effects of DDE and M2 on AR autoregulation as well as the effects of pre-exposure to these chemicals on cellular responsiveness to androgen. Two different models of androgen target tissues, LNCap (prostate cancer) and T47D (breast cancer), will be used for these studies. Our long- term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which these environmental antiandrogens affect AR autoregulation and responsiveness and how these effects may be associated with detrimental and developmental pathologies.

       " 'Genetically induced alterations in the cellular apoptotic response are important for mechanisms of environmental carcinogenesis. Tumor suppressor genes may function to regulate proliferative or apoptotic signaling pathways. The functions of the Tsc2 tumor suppressor gene are unknown. The Tsc2 gene product, tuberin, has been shown to have GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity that may regulate apoptotic signaling pathways that depend on GTPase activity. The Raf-1 ERK and PI3 kinase Akt signaling pathways are two signaling pathways that may depend on GTPase activity. The proposed studies are designed to determine if Tsc2 functions to regulate apoptotic signaling and whether it does so by altering the activity or expression of signal transduction proteins in these pathways, specifically Raf- 1, ERK, and Akt. To test this hypothesis, we will specifically: (1) measure the effect of Tsc2 expression on the apoptotic response of renal epithelial cells exposed to apoptosis-inducing compounds; (2) develop stable lines of Tsc2 null cells that have inducible and readily detectable expression of wild type Tsc2 or the Tsc2 GAP domain and measure the apoptotic response of these cells to apoptosis inducing compounds; and (3) examine the effect of wild type Tsc2 and Tsc2 GAP domain expression on Raf-1, ERK and Akt levels and activities. The long-term objective of these studies is to establish a mechanistic link between gene expression, apoptosis, environmental exposure, and carcinogenesis. The proposed studies may be relevant to future studies that seek to predict the influence of environmental factors on the onset of diseases with genetic predisposition. These endpoints may also be useful in the development of new anti-neoplastic strategies. ',\n",

The model we propose combines the useful properties of two different SPERM models: negative feedback and target estimation. The model creates a high-level central representation of target velocity. Simultaneously, the model behaves like feedback controller which depends upon visual feedback delay. We will perform parametric fits of SPEM behavioral data using a preliminary model. This operation will : 1) establish model parameter values and 2) show if revision to the preliminary model are required. The model will contain adaptive mechanisms which develop and maintain values of the model. We also propose and perform and experiment which will serve as a test of our model. The experiment will test the ability to track an invisible target whose velocity is determined while the eyes are stationary. We will use the results of the experiment refine our model. ',\n",

The goal of this project is to examine properties of deep layer entorhinal neurons and their connectivity with elements of both the directional and locational circuits. Specifically, we will focus on the inputs from subiculum and presubiculum to deep layer medical entorhinal neuronsin rat brain slices. Fundamental data needs to be acquired: 1) cell shape and dendritic extent; 2) basic membrane properties; 3) target neurons of the two inputs; 4) functional nature of each input (i.e. excitatory or inhibitory); and 5) possible convergence of subicular and presubicular inputs into single entorhinal neurons. Perhaps surprisingly, these studies have not been done. Intracellular recording techniques in brain slices will be used t acquire these data. The techniques are well established in the sponsor\\'s laboratory. The project is straightforward for training in the sense that the data are not difficult to obtain. However, since it is a project intended to collect some of the most basic information about a brain region, there is considerable latitude to focus experimental emphasis on a particular discovery made along the way.

       " \"The affective and cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) pose significant problem in the field of mental health. These symptoms could result from subthalamic nucleus hyperactivity, causing increased excitatory amino acid (EAA) release and EAA desensitization in the ventral pallidum (VP). If cholinergic neurons, which govern cognitive functions, are preferentially sensitive to AMPA, and GABAergic neurons, which influence affective states, are preferentially sensitive to NMDA, then perhaps specific therapy can be directed toward each sub-population. We hypothesize that changes consistent with increased EAA neurotransmission occur in the VP following a substantia nigra lesion. In a rat model of PD with a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion of the substantia nigra, we will compare left and right pallidal regions to test the following hypothesis in three Specific Aims. Hypothesis 1: Dopamine deafferentation will increase spontaneous neuronal activity and decrease sensitivity to EAA agonists in the VP. Neuronal firing will be measured by extracellular single neuron electrophysiology. Microiontophoresis of receptor subtype-selective EAA agonists and antagonists will be used to measure EAA sensitivity and endogenous EAA-induced spontaneous firing, respectively. Hypothesis 2: dopamine deafferentation will reduce EAA-evoked c-fos c-jun expression in the VP, and will differentially alter EAA receptor subtype-selective agonist-evoked c-fos c-jun expression between cholinergic and GABAergic neurons.. Expression of C-fos c-jun will be induced by microinjection of EAA receptor subtype-selective agonists into the VP. C-Fos c-Jun and markers for cholinergic or GABAergic neurons will be detected by immunofluorescence. Hypothesis 3: destruction of neurons in the subthalamic nucleus will tend to normalize the changes in spontaneous neuronal activity and EAA-induced effects in the VP caused by dopamine deafferentation. Neurons in the subthalamic nucleus ipsilateral to the lesioned substantia nigra will be destroyed with ibotenic acid and the procedures outlined for specific Aims 1 and 2 will be repeated. \",\n",
       " \"All mammals possess a circadian clock that governs daily oscillations with neural, hormonal, and metabolic functions for the organism with a near 24-h period. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) within the brain's hypothalamus houses this clock. The SCN has neural connections with various regions of the brain. Prominent among these connections are cholinergic projections from regions of the brain responsible for asleep and alerting, namely the basal forebrain (BF) and brainstem. A considerable body of work is available regarding intracellular signal transduction pathways within SCN. Pharmacological studies in vitro have implicated the M1-subtype of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1AChR) as the receptor mediating the effects of cholinergics on the circadian system. Recently, the International Union of Pharmacology Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classification has questioned the specificity of the drugs used to implicate the M1AChR in the cholinergic signaling cascade. In lieu of specific pharmacology, other methods must be employed to confidently identify the receptor(s) mediating cholinergic circadian signaling. In this proposal, electrophysiological, behavioral and anatomical studies will be carried out in mice devoid of the M1AChR (M1KO). First, the B6129PF1 J mouse, a mouse of similar genetic background to the M1K0, will be tested for sensitivity to the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, both in vitro and in vivo. Second, the M1KO will be tested for decreased sensitivity to carbachol. Finally, double-label fluorescence confocal microscopy will be used to evaluate whether the cholinergic terminals within the SCN are juxtaposed to M1AChR-containing cells and to map their distribution. \",\n",
       " ' Men and women suffer disproportionally from specific neurological and psychiatric disorders and the basis for this difference remains unclear. However, given that males and females are exposed to different levels of steroids throughout development, a role for these hormones in the etiology of sexually dimorphic neurological disorders is strongly suggested. Investigating the consequences of this dimorphic exposure will help elucidate the mechanisms of steroid action on the developing brain. Previous research in our laboratory implicates astrocytes as an important target of steroid hormone action in select regions of the developing perinatal rodent brain. The preoptic area (POA) is a major brain region controlling sex-typic behavior and physiology, and preliminary data suggest that astrocytes of this region are also responsive to steroids. We have found that as early as the day of birth, the morphology of astrocytes of the POA are sexually dimorphic. The importance of astrocytes in the establishment of neuronal architecture is becoming increasingly evident. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism(s) of steroid-mediated changes in POA neuronal morphology involving neighboring steroid-sensitive astrocytes. Hormonal manipulation experiments will establish the steroid specificity determining neuron differentiation within the developing POA. To begin to determine the functional relationship between the two cell types, experiments will identify the components of an astrocyte-to-neuron communication cascade and examine the effect of steroid manipulation on this system. Pharmacological manipulations and the use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides will explore the roles of prostaglandin E2 and the activation of their cognate receptors in this signal transduction mechanism.',\n",

Discovery of putative Galphai o- binding (\"GoLoco\") motifs has led us to the hypothesis that RGS12 and RGS14 coordinate heterotrimeric G-protein signaling pathways by modifying the GDP GTP cycle or serving as scaffolds for Galpha subunits. We will determine the selectivity and structural determinants of RGS12 and RGS14 GoLoco regions by a combination of yeast-two hybrid, in vitro coprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance binding assays, and co-immunoprecipitation studies. We will also determine the effects of GoLoco association on the Galpha GDP GTP-cycle through in vitro measurements of nucletide binding and hydrolysis. Finally, using x-ray crystallography, we will ascertain the atomic resolution structure of a Galpha GoLoco complex to understand, at the molecular level, the specificity and activity demonstrated by GoLoco motifs. Our long term objectives are to define the molecular mechanisms governing RGS protein activity to provide future therapeutic targets for disease states and clinical disorders associated with aberrant Gprotein coupled receptor signaling. The initial objectives outlined in this proposal are to define the molecular basis of the binding specificity, structural determinants, and biochemical activities of isolated GoLoco regions of RGS12 and RGS14 in order to better understand the role that RGS12 and 14 play in regulating signal transduction in neurons.

       " ' My research proposal focuses on a fundamental question in behavioral neuroscience: What is the neural basis of social attachment In our model of social attachment using the monogamous prairie vole, we have identified a brain region, the ventral pallidum, and a neuropeptide receptor, the vasopressin receptor (V1aR), that appear to be critical for the formation of the pair bond between monogamous mates. The three specific aims outlined in this proposal will further elucidate the role of the VIaR in the ventral pallidum during pair bond formation. First, we will examine the neuronal activation, assessed by induction of c-Fos expression, in the ventral pallidum and other candidate brain regions during mating. Next, we will determine the necessity of VIaR in the ventral pallidum or other candidate regions in pair bond formation using pharmacological manipulation. Finally, we will identify the other neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems that colocalize with V1aR in these critical regions and which of these may be involved during pair bond formation. The results from these aims will help us understand how the V1aR may be acting to mediate pair bonding and ultimately generate novel and viable hypotheses regarding the neurobiology of social attachment.',\n",
       " ' (Verbatim from applicants abstract): Impairment of learning and memory is a common phenomenon associated with advancing age, although the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. Based on previous reports of age-correlated increases in dynorphin expression in the brain and on studies of effects of dynorphin in vivo and in vitro, we are investigating a possible role of the endogenous opioid neuropeptide dynorphin in age-associated decline in mental health. We have recently found that moderately aged prodynorphin knockout mice perform significantly better than similarly aged wild-type mice in a spatial learning and memory task, suggesting an important role of this peptide in causing memory dysfunction. We hypothesize that age-related alterations in hippocampal dynorphin levels contribute substantially to functional impairment of learning and memory by altering glutamate neurotransmission or other synaptic activities. To test this hypothesis, we propose a set of behavioral assays to assess hippocampal-dependent learning and memory processes in dynorphin knockout mice and wild-type mice of varying ages. In addition, we will supplement the behavioral studies with electrophysiological analysis and anatomical characterization of specific sites within hippocampus where dynorphin is localized. These experiments will allow us to determine the functional role of hippocampal dynorphin in modulating neuronal activity associated with learning and memory processes, which may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of learning and memory dysfunction.',\n",
       " ' Anxiety disorders and depression are among the most common psychiatric disorders. The etiology of these conditions is unknown, but exposure to stress and an inability to cope with stress likely contribute to the development of these disorders. Dysregulation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) system is associated with depression and certain anxiety disorders, making it a likely candidate for linking stress to these disorders. CRH and its receptors are known to play a role in mediating the stress response. Recent work suggests that CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP) may also play a role in stress. Evidence suggests that CRH-BP binds locally released CRH and prevents its action at CRH receptors. CRH-BP may thus serve to maintain homeostasis in the CRH system, thereby limiting the stress response. Despite this, CRH-BP remains a poorly understood component of the CRH system. The proposed research will focus on the nature of the interactions of CRH-BP with CRH and CRH receptors within the brain during stress. An examination of the stress-induced regulation and function of CRH-BP may prove useful in understanding mechanisms underlying stress-related psychopathology and may lead to new treatment approaches for disorders involving dysregulation of the CRH system.',\n",

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a pathogen responsible for great morbidity and mortality in different populations. The increase of antibiotic resistance to this and other bacteria, and the fact that current pneumococcal vaccines are not completely effective accentuate the need for better vaccines. Increased susceptibility to pneumococcal infection is particularly evident in immune impaired groups such as HIV+ individuals, newborns, bone marrow recipients, and the elderly, though S. pneumoniae causes disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. This proposal will use the phage-displayed technology to identify peptide mimotopes that bind to antibodies reactive with the capsular polysaccharide of serotype 8 pneumococcus (PPS-8). The peptides will be used as vaccine targets to determine if they elicit protective antibody responses in experimental pneumococcal infection. SCID-hu mice will be utilized to study the antibody responses to the peptides. Thus, human antibody responses can be studied. In addition, the reagents generated can be used to study the specificity of vaccine elicited antibodies in different patient groups. ',\n",

Of particular interest to me are the biophysical interactions between viral and cellular proteins that occur during receptor binding and membrane fusion. Studying these interactions may lead to a clearer understanding of the basic mechanisms of viral entry may help to explain viral tropism, as seen in human diseases such as HIV or the common cold. Furthermore, new therapeutic strategies may be developed based on better understanding of the molecular and atomic interactions that are taking place during viral attachment and entry into host cells.

Because production of IFNg is crucial in both innate and adaptive immunity to toxoplasmosis, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of this cytokine will be paramount to developing novel treatment strategies. The transcription factor NF-kB has been implicated in the production of IFNg by both NK and T cells; principal mediators of innate and adaptive immunity to toxoplasmosis respectively. Using retroviral gene transfection to selectively inhibit NF-kB signaling, it will be possible to assess the role of this transcription factor in the production of IFNg by NK cells in vitro. In addition, by reconstituting sublethally irradiated RAG - - mice with these virally transfected cells, the importance of NF-kB signaling in innate immunity to toxoplasmosis can be determined in vivo.

Investigations within this area attempt to elucidate the fundamental immunologic mechanisms of T cell activation and duplication in relation to organ rejection. Thus, though transplantation is of immense intricacy clinically, it is studied on a very basic scientific level. I believe that this generates an inherent appeal in the MD Ph.D. candidate.

       " 'Pathogenic organisms must accomplish several tasks in order to cause disease, including the secretion of virulence factors. Gram-negative bacteria, however, have two membranes and a space in between that creates a formidable obstacle to secretion. The autotransporters (ATs), a family of proteins characterized by a signal sequence at the N-terminus that directs them to the periplasmic space, a C-terminal domain that forms a barrel in the outer membrane, and a passenger domain that is translocated through this barrel, provide a remarkably simple solution for this problem. However, outer membrane translocation by ATs is not well understood. The autotransporters can be further divided into subfamilies. One of these is the Serine Protease Autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATES). These are secreted virulence factors that possess a serine protease motif in their passenger domains. This proposal seeks to study the mechanism of secretion of EspP, a member of this subfamily, as a model for the SPATES. Our hypothesis is that EspP will have a linker region that aids in efficient translocation of the passenger domain through the outer membrane. The first aim seeks to define the predicted secondary structure of this linker. The second aim is to study the relationship between linker structure and function both for efficient outer membrane translocation and insertion of the C-terminus into the outer membrane. These studies will help in accomplishing the long-term goals of understanding autotransporter secretion so that its potential use for antigen presentation in live vaccines can be developed. They will also provide a clearer understanding of gram-negative pathogenesis. ',\n",
       " ' (provided by applicant) Shigella spp. are bacterial pathogens that cause an estimated I million deaths and 163 million cases of diarrhea and dysentery annually worldwide, predominantly in children. Shigella cause disease by invading and spreading through the colonic epithelium. Shigella spread by entering the cytoplasm of the host cell and inducing the assembly of an actin tail on the bacterial body. Actin tail formation involves bacterial recruitment of cellular actin assembly machinery. Dr. Goldberg laboratory has demonstrated that the Shigella protein IcsA is sufficient to mediate this process. IcsA utilizes the cellular Cdc42 signal transduction pathway for actin assembly, which has been shown to be important in filopodia formation. This cellular pathway involves Cdc42 activation of members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family. Activated WASP family members activate the Arp213 complex to nucleate actin and polymerize new filaments, which Arp2 3 cross-links at 700 angles to pre-existing filaments. IcsA is known to bind N-WASP, a member of the WASP family, yet the mechanism by which it activates N-WASP is unknown. IcsA is essential to Shigella virulence. We propose to characterize the mechanism of lcsA activation of N-WASP. We will identify residues of N-WASP and lcsA that are important to either lcsA binding or lcsA activation of N-WASP. We will then test whether N-WASP is activated by lcsA in a fashion similar to its activation by Cdc42. These studies will provide insight into both the molecular mechanisms of Shigella pathogenesis and the molecular mechanisms of 0dc42-mediated actin assembly.',\n",

This occurs when cancerous cells from a tumor enter the bloodstream and invade into tissues and organs. Recently, our laboratory found that inhibition of the Na,K pump results in increased intracellular sodium in kidney epithelial cells, which induces a signal transduction pathway leading to metastasis. Differential display screening revealed that one of the key players in this pathway is the MDM2 oncoprotein, which is responsible for degradation of p53, a tumor suppressor protein. The main goal of this research is to understand the significance of the induction of AMID upon inhibition of the sodium pump and to characterize the consequence of MDM2 overexpression in polarized kidney epithelial cells.

We have also demonstrated that when these sells are chronically exposed to morphine, phagocytosi is no longer affected suggesting the induction of a state to desentization or tolerance. We plan to study these effects further by conducting a detailed pharmacological study to determine if true morphine tolerance4.

Preliminary studies in our labs have shown that the gabaa receptor antagonist biccuculine increases food intake as well as produces a conditioned place preference when infused into the ventral pallidum. The purpose of the proposed experiments is to examine the putative link between biccuculine reward in the ventral pallidum with opiate reward in the same structure This will be accomplished by 1) carefully examining the pharmacology of opiate and biccuculine reward in the ventral pallidum, and 2) testing to see if the doses of biccuculine and opiates that are rewarding in the ventral pallidum are also able to increase food intake and hedonic tastes reactivity scores during feeding tests. These experiment will hopefully provide additional insights into the neurobiology of opiate reward. ',\n",

The fact that the first generation of cued speech users who are in their thirties and mid-twenties tend to congregate with other cues and use cued speech after high school makes one wonder if there is a change in the way cued speech is used. Invented signed communication systems are often replaced with ASL after deaf children leave high school but cued speech seem to remain strong among its users. I propose a study of the linguistic properties and nativization of cued speech. My preliminary studies show that Deaf adult cuers use emphatic stress by using both hands simultaneously, use role shifting by alternating the hands for each 'speaker', and use non-manual markers comparable to non-manual markers used in signed languages. This proposal addresses whether or not the structural change of cued speech is a direct result of nativization. \",\n",
       " ' (provided by applicant) Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is a commonly inherited disorder predisposing humans to premature fusion of the skull calvarial bones (craniosynostosis) and a variety of limb defects. Greater than 45 percent of SCS patients have loss-of-function mutations in one copy of the Twist gene, making Twist haploinsufficiency a causative factor for SCS. Mice also show haploinsufficiency for Twist, as Twist heterozygotes exhibit craniofacial defects and toe duplications. Twist is a well-conserved basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein essential for embryonic development in Drosophila and mouse. Its loss-of-function phenotypes in the limbs suggest that Twist normally has important patterning functions during limb development, interestingly, published and preliminary data show that overexpression of another bHLH protein essential for limb development, HAND2, causes phenotypes resembling those seen in SCS patients and in mice haploinsufficient for Twist. Because HAND2 gain-of-function phenocopies Twist loss-of-function, we hypothesize that HAND2 and Twist interact antagonistically during limb development. We will test for a genetic interaction between the two genes using simultaneous loss-of-function and simultaneous gain-of-function assays in both mouse and chick. In addition, we will use biochemical assays to determine the molecular mechanism behind the interaction between HAND2 and Twist.',\n",
       " \" (Adapted from the Applicant's ): The main hypothesis of the proposed doctoral studies is that traffic and residential wood burning are important contributors of particulate matter (PM) and elemental carbon (EC) to indoor environments, where people spend most of their time. Particulate matter is of importance because epidemiological studies have identified a correlation between daily ambient particle concentrations and increased morbidity and mortality. Elemental carbon is one of the components of PM. Elemental carbon will be used as a tracer for diesel traffic and wood burning because the only known source of aerosol EC in the atmosphere is the combustion of carbonaceous fuels. In addition of EC wood burning and diesel engines generate products of incomplete combustion, including carbon monoxide, and organic matter such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Studies have shown that extractable organic matter (which contains PAHs) from particles generated by traffic and residential wood burning are mutagenic and carcinogenic. Instruments which measure PM and EC concentrations in real time will be used to distinguish between indoor and outdoor sources. The study will involve simultaneous indoor and outdoor sampling of PM and EC using direct-reading instruments. Sampling will be conducted for a year at two locations: an urban community heavily impacted by vehicular traffic, and a suburban community with less vehicular traffic, but where wood burning occurs regularly in the fall and winter months. Results from this study will more fully establish the causal association between PM sources and exposure in the urban environment so that public health can be more fully assessed.\",\n",
       " 'This is a proposal to address statistical design and analysis issues related to occupational and environmental morbidity and mortality studies. In general, modest elevations in morbidity and mortality risk associated with exposure to particular toxic and hazardous substances found in the environment will be hard to detect in population or community-based studies. In some cases, epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed cohorts are extremely useful in quantifying environmental risks because workers are generally exposed to higher levels of toxic materials than the general population. These higher levels of exposure make it easier to detect and characterize modest elevations in morbidity and mortality risk associated to toxic and hazardous substances found in the workplace. However, occupational studies are also plagued with a form of selection bias known as the healthy worker effect (HWE) which can distort the shape of the exposure-response relationship and lead to bias towards the null hypothesis of no causal association between exposure and disease onset. Mr. Tchetgen will investigate statistical methods that can be used to consistently estimate the causal morbidity or mortality effect of occupational exposure while accounting for the HWE. In addition to methodologic work, Mr Tchetgen will have the opportunity to use these novel methods to re-analyze data collected in a morbidity and mortality study of occupational exposure to metalworking fluids in the automobile industry. Although some emphasis will be placed on the metalworking fluid case study, this research is most relevant to environmental health studies in general where risk assessment is of prime importance.

The E6 and E7 genes of HPV attractive tumor-associated antigens for immunotherapy and several trials of therapeutic vaccines for cervical cancer are underway. The results to date have been only marginally successful since most patients apparently default to a T-helper type 2(Th2) response rather than a potentially more efficacious T-helper type (Th1) response. The eukaryotic initiation factor of Leishmania braziliensis (LeIF) is a potent and specific Th1 stimulator. It hypothesized that a vaccine containing the HPV proteins E 6 and or E7 and utilizing the adjuvant LeIF will elicit a Th1 response to HPV associated tumors. To test this hypothesis, the following experiments will be performed: 1. The ability of LeIF to overcome the inherent Th2 preference of BALB c mice will be determined. In addition, a comparison of LeIF with other adjuvant formulations will be performed. 2. The ability of HPV vaccinated BALB c mice to reject autologous tumor cells tranfected with genes encoding HPV antigents will be determined.

I am particularly interested in individual variations in drug response. Since pharmacogenetics is the field most closely aligned with this interest, it is my field of choice. I believe that by using pharmacogenetics to delineate genetic polymorphisms, or rare variant alleles that increase susceptibility to adverse drug reactions, these toxic and adverse reactions will be greatly lessened in the future. Patients will be able to be genotyped before taking certain drugs, to pre-determine if they are risk for toxicity. If they are found to have the susceptibility polymorphism, than an alternate mode of therapy can be substituted. I believe that in the area of the Human Genome Project, this type of knowledge is even more attainable. Pharmacogenetics research will revolutionize drug therapy as we know it, making it less toxic and more individualized. It is for these reasons that pharmacogenetics is an extremely exciting field in which I plan to study. ',\n",
       " 'While formaldehyde is a highly reactive compound that is toxic to cells and the environment, it is a common metabolic intermediate in the biological oxidation of many methylated compounds. This toxin has the ability to react with biological macromolecules by introducing nicks into double stranded DNA, cross-linking proteins to DNA and cross-linking single stranded DNA and RNA. Much of the formaldehyde that is found in our atmosphere results from the photo-oxidation of methane, oxidation of hydrocarbons released from plants and by numerous industrial products (cosmetics, cigarette smoke, automotive emissions, etc.); that contain this chemical as an ingredient. Due to the prevalence of formaldehyde in our society and its reactivity with various intracellular components, it is not surprising to find that all cells have mechanisms to remove this potentially lethal compound. Recent results have shown that the facultative formaldehyde oxidizer, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, is an ideal organism to study the biological oxidation of formaldehyde since we know this biotransformation requires an enzyme that has been identified in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In addition, the ongoing sequencing project of the R. sphaeroides genome has identified a gene cluster that shows significant similarity to gene products of other facultative formaldehyde oxidizing eubacteria. I will use in-frame deletion mutagenesis to determine the role of each gene product within this cluster and transposon mutagenesis to identify additional proteins required to metabolize formaldehyde. Both techniques will assist in dissecting the mechanism used by cells to metabolize formaldehyde and shed new light onto the study of the biological formation and oxidation of formaldehyde. ',\n",
       " ' The Herpes simplex virus (HSV) particle consists of a DNA-containing capsid surrounded by a lipid envelope which bears a diverse array of membrane proteins. Lining the inner surface of the envelope is a complex and poorly characterized layer of polypeptides termed tegument. The HSV envelope is acquired by budding of capsids through host cell organellar membranes, and envelope formation is essential for the subsequent transmission of viral disease. However, little is known of the molecular details of envelope assembly. A key step in envelope formation is likely to be the binding of tegument polypeptides to the cytoplasmic tails of viral envelope glycoproteins. This recruitment of tegument onto the membrane may then provide a binding site for the viral capsid. We have confirmed this hypothesis by developing assay systems which reconstitute the interaction of glycoprotein tails, tegument proteins and HSV capsids in vitro. With these assay systems available we now propose to use biochemical and recombinant DNA techniques to investigate the molecular events which take place during HSV particle assembly. ',\n",

A diverse array of cargo is trafficked through the pore, each cargo type upholding specific requirements for transport. Although all nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is known to converge at the NPC, specific routes and mechanisms of passage through the pore are not well understood. The broad, long-tern objective of this research is to contribute to an understanding of the mechanistic role of nuclear pore proteins in the transport of cargo through the NPC. The pore protein Nup 153 has been shown to have a central role in the export of several types of RNA in vivo, as well as maintain stable association with RNA in vitro. The aims of this thesis will, therefore, address the following: (1) The domain within Nup 153 that confers RNA association will be identified and characterized using an in vitro binding assay. (2) In vitro binding assays and protein interaction screens will be used to establish the. physiological targets of Nup153. (3) Finally, the role of association between RNA and Nup153 will be studied in vivo using Xenopus oocyte microinjection. Such experiments will lead to an understanding of Nup153's functional role in RNA export. Nucleocytoplasmic transport processes, such as RNA export, are often deregulated in virally-infected cells.

EF-G is a GTPase that binds to ribosomal RNA, and it interacts with ribosomal proteins. The hydrolysis of bound GTP is necessary for the release of EF-G from the ribosome, and then the creation of the next peptide bond can occur. How EF-G binds the ribosome and catalyzes translocation at the molecular level remains unknown. The long-term objectives of this research are to: 1) characterize the interaction between EF-G and ribosomal RNA using biophysical techniques, and 2) gain a greater insight into the mechanism of GTP-dependent ribosome translocation. Therefore, we aim to solve the atomic resolution X-ray crystal structure of EF-G in complex with specific domains of ribosomal RNA and GTP analogs. These crystal structures will be analyzed in terms of how conformational changes in EF-G bound to rRNA and the hydrolysis of GTP by EF-G, are coupled to elongation during protein synthesis. ',\n",

HDV has been shown to employ an RNA enzyme, or ribozyme, in its replication cycle. The ribozyme cleaves the multimeric genome from rolling circle replication into unit length RNAs by self- cleavage of a specific phosphodiester bond. The proposed mechanism for this cleavage involves general acid-base catalysis with Cytosine 75 (C75) acting as the general acid and a hydrated metal hydroxide acting as the general base. The crystal structure of the HDV ribozyme supports the general-acid role of C75. However, the inferred metal is absent, presumably because the structure is of the cleaved foam and lacks a putative scissile phosphate-hydrated magnesium ion ligand. The aim of the proposed work is to test the mechanism by identifying the hydrated metal-hydroxide-binding site and measuring the pKa of C75's imino nitrogen. The main technique is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Cobalt hexammine will be used as a competitive inhibitor of the active-site magnesium. Its location will be determined through chemical shift perturbations induced on nearby imino protons. 13C and 15N isotopic labeling of the short piece of a two-piece construct will be used to simplify assignment of C75. This system will also be used to investigate the pKa of C75 by 13C NMR pH titration.

It is found in most prokaryotes and eukaryotes as well as plant and animal tissue. Because of its antioxidant properties, lipoic acid has been shown to prevent diabetic neuropathy and to successfully treat heavy metal poisoning. Although lipoic acid is a relatively simple cofactor in structure, the mechanism by which it is biosynthesized is presently unknown. Recent studies from several laboratories indicate that the product of the lipA gene in E. coli (lipoic acid synthase or LAS) mediates insertion of two sulfur atoms into the 6 and 8 positions of octanoic acid. Characterization of the protein product of the lipA gene suggests that LAS is a member of an emerging class of enzymes that use AdoMet synergistically with iron- sulfur clusters to initiate radical dependent enzymatic reactions, cleaving AdoMet to 5'-deoxyadenosine and methionine in the process. Well- characterized members of this family include lysine 2,3-aminomutase, pyruvate-formate lyase activase, and anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase activase. The goal of the researched proposed herein is to show experimentally that AdoMet functions similarly in LAS. This will be carried out by determining whether AdoMet binds to LAS and by assessing whether tritium or deuterium is transferred to 5'- deoxyadenosine from various isotopically labeled forts of octanoic acid. Lastly, analogues of AdoMet with the potential to stabilize a radical at the 5'-carbon of 5'-deoxyadenosine will be used to establish the involvement of radical intermediates in the LAS reaction. \",\n",
       " ' Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is the process by which cholesterol (Ch) from peripheral tissues, in the form of high density lipoprotein (HDL), is returned to the liver for elimination from the body. Formation of HDL particles begins when detergent-like apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) molecules, secreted by hepatocytes, incorporate phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and Ch from the cell membrane. Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Protein (PC-TP) is a cytosolic protein of unknown function that is highly expressed in liver and in vitro catalyzes the intermembrane transfer of PCs exclusively. Based on its substrate specificity, enrichment in the liver and the disproportionately high PC composition of HDL (PCs constitute >80% of HDL lipid but only ~50% cellular lipid), we hypothesize that PC-TP plays a critical role in the process of HDL formation. We postulate that PC-TP supplies PCs to the plasma membrane for incorporation into nascent preBETA-HDL. This hypothesis will be tested by radiolabeling Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that overexpress PC-TP with [3H] cholesterol or [3H] choline and performing lipid efflux experiments, according to standard methods, using apoA-I as the lipid acceptor. The extent to which the effects of PC-TP on lipid secretion are dependent on the synthetic rate of PCs or on the presence of scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) will be evaluated by utilizing cells that, in addition to PC-TP, also overexpress CTP: choline cytidilyltransferase (CT) and SR-BI respectively. We also propose a role for PC-TP in SR-BI mediated cellular uptake of lipids from HDL. We will discern this role by differentially labeling the protein and lipid components of HDL using [3H] Ch, [3H] dipalmitoyl PC, and [125I] HDL protein for Ch, PCs and protein respectively. Cells that overexpress both PC-TP and SR-BI will be incubated with these radiolabeled particles. Membrane binding will then be measured and rates of lipid uptake determined. We hope our findings will provide new insights into HDL metabolism and help lead to the development of novel strategies for reducing the risk of coronary heart disease.',\n",

It remains unclear the mechanism underlying the difference in magnitude of activation of MAPK 1,2 but it has been hypothesized that it involves regulatory contributions from the cAMP signaling cascade. Here we present a novel regulatory feedback loop that may be able to promote the sustained activation of MAPK 1,2 in response to growth factors. This loop involves the differential expression of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase PDE4D long and short isoforms. Depending on the predominant ratios of long to short PDE4D isoforms found in PC12 cells, the activation of MAPK can be sustained or transient.

These processes are governed by signal transduction pathways involving a cascade of events in which Rho G proteins and Dbl family proteins play a key role. Aberrations in the regulation of these proteins leads to oncogenic cellular transformation. All Dbl proteins are characterized by the presence of a conserved DH domain followed by a PH domain. The PH domain is a membrane-targeting domain which acts to localize proteins to the membrane through PH domain interactions with phosphoinositides, while the DH domain is responsible for activation of the Rho G protein which propagates the signal downstream. Several studies suggest that the PH domains Dbl proteins regulate the DH domain. Our goal is to understand the role of the PH domain in control of the DH domain in Dbl family proteins. This understanding is essential for the appreciation of cell growth regulation and migration and for potential approaches to pharmacological intervention. The specific aim are: 1. We will test the hypothesis that weak Ptdlns binding by the PH domain in Dbl proteins is important for the normal GEF activity of the full-length protein in-vivo. 2. We will test the hypothesis that Dbl proteins utilize a mechanism of regulated avidity, involving the PH domain, for membrane targeting and exchange activity on Rho family G proteins. 3.

Hopefully, this work will allow us to generate a map of the ordered assembly pathway for the trans-acting factors that function in biogenesis of the 60S subunit by elucidating the formation, rearrangement and maturation of specific protein-rRNA complexes. This research has implications to cancer biology, as the ribosome has an important role in cell proliferation and growth Furthermore, genetic defects in nucleolar proteins, ribosomal proteins and rRNAs have been linked to a number of diseases that arise as a result of improper assembly and biogenesis of ribosomes.',\n",
       " ' (provided by applicant) The PutA protein from Salmonella is a complex multifunctional protein that functions as a flavin dehydrogenase when associated with the membrane and as a transcriptional repressor when located in the cytoplasm. In addition, PutA is autophosphorylated on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in vivo and in vitro. PutA protein contains many serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, and the positions of the serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated is unknown. Furthermore, although a model has been proposed that phosphorylation limits the toxic accumulation of excess PutA in the membrane, because it has been impossible to directly test this hypothesis, the function of PutA autophosphorylation is unknown. The primary goals of this research are to identify the sites within PutA that are phosphorylated, to construct mutations that alter phosphorylation of these sites, and to determine the effect of these mutations on each of the functions of PutA. In addition, this research will define the functional domains of PutA protein. These studies may reveal mechanisms used to coordinate the expression and activity of important peripheral membrane proteins in response to the availability of membrane-binding sites.',\n",

       " ' (provided by investigator): During the 1990s, microcredit has been increasingly referred to as an effective means of poverty reduction Microcredit programs provide small loans and savings opportunities to those who have been traditionally excluded from commercial financial services Microcredit programs have also been increasingly referred to as an effective means in reducing hunger and malnutrition At the same time, health related issues have been cited as a factor that prevents poor women from participating in a microcredit program. Moreover, there are groups of Malian women that choose not to participate in microcredit programs. This study explores two research questions: (1) How do women decide whether to participate or not in a microcredit program and (2) What are some of the health concerns, as perceived by urban Malian women, that prevent them from participating in a microcredit program In West Africa, it is generally women who are the caretakers in the household. If someone becomes ill, it is the role of women to care for the sick. To answer these questions, I plan to combine qualitative and quantitative methods in identifying processes of decision-making within womens networking groups and to document womens self identified health and nutritional illnesses which limit their involvement in activities outside of the home. Studying social group dynamics could be beneficial to social scientists studying individual and or group behavior across numerous and wide-ranging contexts. Conceivably, this will be the first baseline study of urban Malian womens assessment of their health and nutritional needs from their point of view. This baseline study will expand our cultural and medical understanding of how women globally are impacted by disease and illness. Broadening our knowledge globally of how health and nutritional issues are intertwined with economic development efforts will make clear the need for a more integrative approach using microcredit programs in conjunction with health education training for poor women.',\n",

A viral system will be developed to allow the replacement of the wild-type Polypurine Tract (WT PPT) with specific mutations, which have been determined using an in vitro assay. The sequence requirements will further be defined by doing an \"in vivo selection\" assay. This basically entails replacing the WT PPT with a pool of mutations made in vitro. The mutations will then be replaced into a NL4-3 virus background and allowed to replicate. Through successive rounds of replication and re-infection the viruses, which can best replicate, will be selected. The RNA from the selected viruses will be extracted and RT-PCR performed. Finally, pools of virus and individual clones of the RT-PCR products will be sequenced to determine those sequences, which can support replication. The same strategy will also be used to determine the sequence requirements of a region immediately upstream of the PPT known as the U-box region. Together this information will provide detailed information on the reverse transcription step in viral replication.',\n",

Treatments to prevent premature birth could have a profound effect on fetal mortality and morbidity. Cervical ripening precedes the onset of normal labor and can lead to preterm labor if the cervix dilates early. NO, which is produced by NO synthase enzymes (NOS), is believed to play a role in cervical ripening and dilation. Endogenous release of PGs produced by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes is also thought to play a role in cervical ripening. The objective of the research is to characterize COX and NOS activity, as well as NO and PG production in the cervix as they relate to cervical ripening. The interactions between the two systems will also be investigated. Aim one is to demonstrate if there is a temporal relationship between COX and NOS under normal and LPS treated conditions by characterizing the patterns of expression and cellular distribution of COX and NOS during pregnancy, labor, and postpartum in rat cervical tissue. Aim two examines whether exogenous (NO-donors) and endogenous NO (LPS) effects COX expression in the absence and presence of NOS inhibitors by determining the patterns of expression and cellular distribution of COX during pregnancy, labor, and postpartum in rat cervical tissue. Aim three estimates if the activation of metabolites of the COX pathway or the exogenous treatments of PGs effect NOS expression in the absence or presence of COX inhibitors by determining the patterns of expression and cellular distribution of NOS during pregnancy, labor, and postpartum in rat cervical tissue. \",\n",

While remarkable progress has been made in understanding and reducing the burden from infectious diseases, epidenucs still continue to erupt in areas ranging from rural villages in Africa to hospital settings in New York City. The emergence of antibiotic resistance, globalization, and epidemiological polarization has contributed to the challenge of fulfilling the purpose of the discipline. Continued study and surveillance of the newest epidemics along with endemic diseases, like TB and the flu, are essential to prevent unnecessary suffering and loss of life. The challenges emerging in the control of the spread of disease can be met by practitioners who are motivated, dedicated, and well trained in their chosen field. Too often, this discipline has focused on the problems of wealthier populations. It has become clear that such a discrepancy can longer be tolerated.

Decreased pulmonary function has been associated with increased reactivity to environmental aeroallergens. Serum IgE mediated allergy causes eosinophilic inflammation of the small airways, thus total serum IgE level has been studied as a potential marker for developing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

Biophysically based computer models that integrate findings on the molecular level to predict macroscopic results are useful in accomplishing this task.

       " \" The reason why some cardiomyocytes, when responding to stress, will undergo apoptosis while others survive and undergo hypertrophy has yet to be elucidated. We hypothesize that doxorubicin, a cancer chemotherapeutic agent, will produce oxidants that will stimulate increased expression of Hic-5 ARA55, which will then bind to Hsp27 preventing its anti-apoptotic effect and cells will die. After the treatment is removed, surviving cells will hypertrophy. Because doxorubicin's use is limited by its cardiotoxicity, elucidation of its mechanisms can help in the development of therapeutics to prevent this effect. To test this hypothesis, we will establish a dose-response curve using the MTT assay and then measure oxidant production with the fluorescent dye, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. We will evaluate changes in Hic-5 ARA 55 expression of Hsp27 expression and phosphorylation by Western blot and IEF analysis. Probucol, an antioxidant, will be used to determine if the toxicity can be ameliorated, helping to confirm the oxidative stress hypothesis. We will also truncate the Hic-5's m-4 domain region where Hsp27 binds to determine if the protein's apoptotic is independent of Hsp27. Results of these studies are anticipated to show that toxicant induced increase in Hic-5 expression will prevent Hsp27's anti-apoptotic effect leading to cell death and surviving cells with hypertrophy.\",\n",
       " 'This study proposes to examine the effects of repeated or chronic stress in squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) and titi monkeys (Callicebus moloch). Chronic activation of the stress response can be induced by repeated exposure to seemingly innocuous events that pose no physical risk to the animals but to which the likelihood of habituation is small. Although many aspects of the response to acute stress has been characterized in these species, the ability to compensate for the glucocorticoid rise associated with the stress response has not been studied nor has the consequences of chronic exposure to stressors. I will separate animals from their social group and place them in a novel environment daily for eight weeks in order to examine both the transient and permanent effects of repeated psychological stress in adult monkeys. The proposed research aims first to describe the circadian rhythm of HPA activity in both species and to describe changes due to exposure to a single stressor. Next, I will examine the consequences of chronic exposure to repeated stress, which are hypothesized to include: 1) increased mean daily output of HPA hormones (including increases in free cortisol and ACTH and a reduction in CBG and bound cortisol), 2) reproductive suppression, 3) immune suppression, 4) decline in health, 5) hippocampal cell death and 6) disruption of social relationships. Finally, the research proposes to compare the effects of repeated stress in squirrel and titi monkeys: titi monkeys are predicted to show greater sensitivity to chronic stress than squirrel monkeys, especially with respect to transient changes in reproductive, immunological, and social processes. However, squirrel monkeys may be expected to exhibit more permanent changes owing to high levels of HPA hormones and a more prolonged response to each exposure to stressor. Testing both species will illuminate the respective roles of physiological predisposition and social relationships in mediating the consequences of chronic stress. To the extent that species respond similarly, I will be able to generalize the effects of chronic stress in social animals. ',\n",

Current evidence indicates that in the adult primate and cat cortex, receptive field properties show a significant degree of integration occurring in the primary visual area (V1). The degree of receptive field modifiability and its neurological substrate, however, remain controversial. The goal of this project is to determine the role of the long range lateral connections in generating receptive field malleability after exposure to an artificial scotoma. The study will investigate three possible synaptic mechanisms by which intrinsic horizontal connections could modify the RF properties. Their effect may be due to an increase in synaptic efficacy, due to a general increase in excitability, or due to specific inhibitory and or excitatory postsynaptic input. The experimental approach of this study incorporates the artificial scotoma electrophysical techniques. However, this proposal expands upon their methodology in two different ways: 1) Pharmacological manipulations will be used to explore the possible synaptic mechanisms. 2) Tetrodes will give a more complete picture of the scotoma's effects on the population of cortical neurons. These two modifications will help to obtain greater insight to the degree of RF malleability and the possible mechanisms generating these changes. Ultimately, this information will help to give a deeper understanding of how the primary visual cortex integrates information to form visual perception and imagery. \",\n",

Early estrogen treatment masculinizes telencephalic song nuclei in genetic females, but blocking estrogen does not demasculinize these nuclei in genetic males. Studies have suggested that the existence of a genetic factor intrinsic to the brain underlies the masculine pattern of song system organization. Recently, a sex difference has been seen in transcriptional levels of 17 alpha hydroxylase (CYP 17), the enzyme that makes androgen, in the telencephalon of developing zebra finches. It is hypothesized that GYP 17 expression extends through the steroid sensitive period of song system development, and is distributed near the song nuclei. This will be investigated using in situ hybridization. It is hypothesized that the different levels of CYP17 mRNA reflect sex differences in protein-mediated transcriptional regulation. DNA sequence from the promoter region of the CYP 17 gene will be determined by screening a cDNA library, performing 5 RACE, and screening a zebra finch genomic library. This represents a first step in identifying the factors that differentially regulate CYP 17 transcription in the telencephalon of developing male and female zebra finch. They will also indicate potential regulatory mechanisms for androgen synthesis in other species, including humans.',\n",

Clinically, it is characterized by mental state abnormalities such as cognitive impairment, psychosis and recurrent hallucinations. The pathologic hallmarks of the disease are cytoplasmic inclusions, called Lewy bodies (LB), that are widely distributed throughout paralimbic and neocortical regions and contain alpha-Synuclein. Based on familial inheritance studies, mutations of the alpha-Synuclein gene have been associated with LB formation.

Additionally, there must be an adequate source of donor cells. The purpose of this proposal is to insert the human telomerase gene (hTERT) into human postmortem-derived neural progenitor cells (HPCPs) in order to improve the survival of transplanted cells and ultimately increase the proliferation of desired cell types.

Determining the effect of ectopic telomerase expression in HPCPs on population doublings, resistance to apoptosis and ability to differentiate into all CNS cell types is the crucial first step in investigating these methods. Assessing the viability, proliferation and differential fates of hTERT+ HPCPs transplanted to a 6-OHDA lesioned rat model of Parkinsons disease, and evaluating functional recovery in transplant recipients will further characterize the extent to which these approaches may contribute to future stem cell therapy for neurological disorders.

       " ' (provided by the applicant): To date, research involving Chlamydia and its host interactions has been hampered by the lack of a functional genetic transformation system. The recently available sequence of the Chlamydia trachomatis genome allows a comprehensive approach in studying this organism. C. trachomatis is an important human pathogen responsible for sexually transmitted disease throughout the world. Current research suggests that chlamydial infections are immunologically mediated. The sequelae of these infections results from a persistent in vivo state where the chlamydial cycle is arrested, while antigen remains a stimulus to the immune response. Many of these infections persist unrecognized for months to years. The biological state of Chlamydia and the factors that lead these persistent infections are unknown. This proposal addresses the study of transcriptional regulation during the chlamydial developmental cycle using a global genomic approach and the determination of whether Chlamydia regulate their developmental cycle to promote persistent infections. These experiments will aid in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms behind chlamydial persistent infections in order to provide new therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat infections caused by this organism.',\n",
       " 'Human diseases that enhance cancer predisposition are associated with increased chromosome rearrangements. Yeast homologs have been found for a number of these disease genes and mutation of the yeast gene shown to cause hyper-recombination. Study of such yeast hyper- recombination mutants will lend insight to the disease processes and cancer etiology in general. The S. cerevisiae Sgs1 DNA helicase is highly homologous to the proteins which are mutated in the Wenner, Bloom and Rothmund-Thomson cancer predisposition syndromes. Sgs1 mutants were identified as suppressors of the slow growth of top3 DNA topoisomerase mutants. top3 mutants exhibit pleiotropic defects including hyper-recombination. The sgsl mutant phenotype is reminiscent of top3, albeit generally less severe. SGS1 epistasis to TOPS indicates that they function in the same pathway. In addition to Top3, yeast also contain the Top1 and Top2 topoisomerases. In pairwise combinations, the three topoisomerases exhibit synergistc defects indicating functional overlaps. Sgs1 physically interacts with Top2 and Top3. sgsl in combination with either topl or top2 mutation exhibits synergistic defects. The functional overlaps antagonisms among Sgs1 Top3 and the other topoisomerases are not understood. The DNA substrates upon which Sgs1 and Top3 act in vivo are not known. Interestingly, Sgs1 Top3 interaction is conserved in humans. The knowledge of when and where Sgs1 and Top3 act during DNA replication recombination in yeast can lend important insight to the human disease process and cancer etiology. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the functions of Sgs1 and Top3 in S. cerevisiae using combined genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches. ',\n",
       " 'The down-regulation of gap junctions has often been associated with cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. In cell culture, closure of connexin 43 (Cx43) channels was found to be an early event in response to activation of oncogenes or growth factor receptors, preceding changes in morphology and growth control. The aim of this study is to systematically characterize the different events in transformation by one particular oncogene, v-src, that has been shown to induce Cx43 uncoupling and to determine to what extent Cx43 uncoupling influences transformation. v-Src uncouples Cx43 gap junctions through activation of the Ras Raf MEK MAPK pathway. MAPK has been demonstrated to directly phosphorylate Cx43 at serine sites within its two SH3 binding domains on the carboxy-terminal domain of the protein. Phosphorylation at these serine sites induces closure of the junctional channel through a \"ball and chain\" mechanism. To eliminate background from endogenous protein, cells that are derived from Cx43 knockout mice will be transfected with temperature sensitive v-src vectors. The various parameters of transformation will be characterized and the importance of MAPK phosphorylation of Cx43 in gap junction uncoupling will be determined. The cells will be transfected with vectors encoding wild type or mutant Cx43 in order to assess the role of gap junction uncoupling in cellular transformation. Based on these results, further experiments are proposed to elucidate the mechanism of Cx43 tumor suppressor activity. ',\n",
       " ' The long-term goal of this research proposal is to elucidate mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis to bone. Approximately, 60-70 percent of breast cancer patients who have died or are dying of breast cancer have bone metastases. Osteonectin (OSN, SPARC, BM-40) is a bone factor that has been found to be a chemo-attractant for breast and prostrate cancer cells. In addition, increased OSN expression has been found in breast cancer, however a connection between increased OSN expression in breast cancer cells and bone metastasis has not been proven. Surprisingly, a cell surface receptor has yet to be identified. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that increased expression of OSN in breast cancer cells increases tumor growth and metastasis to bone, and binding of OSN to its cell surface receptor is important for this process. Specific aim 1 will determine if altered expression of OSN in breast cancer cells will affect tumor cell growth, invasion and protease activity in vitro and specific aim 2 will examine if this altered expression of OSN affects tumor cell growth in the mammary fat pad, in bone and in metastasis to bone in vivo. Specific aim 3 will establish if OSN binds to the cell surface and characterize the cell surface binding protein. A variety of approaches will be utilized to elucidate the role OSN in breast cancer bone metastasis and to identify OSN surface binding proteins. Identification of the OSN binding protein and determining the role of endogenous production of OSN by breast cancer cells may lead to better diagnostic and or therapeutic approaches for breast cancer.',\n",

Following the identification of these proteins, their roles as downstream elements of this pathway will be characterized. The major aim of this proposal is to identify characterize the role of proteins interactive with the cytoplasmic domain of RPTP beta zeta in promoting the PTN signal.

Funding from National Institutes of Health will foster the research proposed here. This work serves multiple purposes. First, significant progress will be made towards the development of a drug that blocks the interaction of the tumorigenic cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2), with its receptor, IL-2Ralpha. Second, we will gain new insights into the nature of small molecule binding at protein interfaces. Third, we will develop a rapid and parallel method for discovering small-molecule protein interactions across a broad range of targets. ',\n",
       " 'Prior exposure either to repeated stress or to stimulants elicits an enhanced behavioral response to an acute amphetamine challenge, suggesting that both stimuli may induce similar neurochemical and or neuroendocrine changes that lead to this sensitized response. One common action of both amphetamine and stress is to stimulate release of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). This neuropeptide is uniquely poise to coordinate the common effects of both stimuli, since CRF acts as both a neurotransmitter within the brain and a regulator of endocrine responses in the periphery. CRF is almost certainly involved in mediating the increase in hypothalamic-adrenalpituitary (HPA) activity that is a common response to both amphetamine and stress. In addition, CRF may also be important in mediating another common effect of amphetamine and stress: an increase in central dopamine (DA) transmission. However, the Dopaminergic actions of central CRF are relatively unexplored and no data exist on the interaction between CRF, DA and the HPA axis in modulating stimulant-induce behavioral phenomena such as sensitization. The proposed studies will directly examine the role of CRF as a mediator of the neurochemical, endocrine and behavioral effects of amphetamine administration in awake, behaving animals, using in vivo microdialysis in conjunction with repeated blood sampling and behavioral testing. It is hypothesized that CRF may directly influence the activity of catecholaminergic neurons, leading to increases in DA-mediated behaviors such as locomotor activity. At the same time, CRF is like to stimulate secretion of adrenal steroids, which, in turn, have been shown to facilitat DA transmission and drug-seeking behaviors. Concurrent examination of the temporal and quantitative characteristics of the DA and HPA responses to amphetamine and CRF should provide valuable information on how these systems are regulated and how this regulation may subsequently be altered by chronic exposure to amphetamine. An increase understanding of the neurochemical and neuroendocrine consequences of stimulant administration will provide valuable insight into how coordinate changes in these pathways may influence drug-related behaviors and may point to novel pharmacological targets for drug abuse therapy.

These studies will characterize neural-hormonal systems determining the expression of incentive relativity effects for sucrose, to show how homeostatic variables normally operate to re-instate the value of typical incentives following exposure to a \"supernormal\" reward, and suggest how they may operate (or fail to operate) during drug abuse. Rats will be trained to devalue a 4% sucrose solution by giving them prior experience with a 32% solution, demonstrated by suppressed intake of the normally rewarding 4% solution relative to controls drinking 4% only. Relativity effects will be exacerbated in a second set of animals by food deprivation. Radioimmunoassays and telemetry will determine whether 32% sucrose solutions entrain circadian feeding rhythms relevant to drugs (corticosterone, insulin, leptin, body temperature, activity), and how major energetic hormone profiles change as reward value for the 4% solution is gradually re-instated over days. C-fos immuno-histo-chemistry will identify brain regions activated by incentive relativity effects, and those activated during recovery from incentive relativity effects. In situ hybridization will be used to identify mRNAs for food-regulatory peptides implicated in drug use (neuropeptide Y, corticotropin-releasing factor, cocaine-amphetamine- regulated transcript) in specific brain circuits. The final pre-shift day (32%) will be compared to Days 1, 2, 4, and 8 of the post-shift (4%), by which time recovery should be complete. ',\n",
       " 'Precise connections established between two auditory brainstem nuclei, nucleus magnocellularis (NM) and nucleus laminaris (NL) are instrumental in conferring time coding in the mature chicken. NM and NL cells are generated from distinct rhombomeric regions in the chick embryo. During development, these cells coalesce within the auditory anlage prior to migrating to their mature hindbrain positions. Given that NM cells synapse onto NL neurons at maturity, the current proposal is designed to test specific hypotheses regarding interactions of NM and NL cells within the auditory anlage. Following rhombomere labeling, cells that give rise to NM and NL neurons can be visualized during migration to mature positions in the hindbrain. During this migratory process, cells will be assessed for functional development of membrane properties. In addition, cell coupling between cells of the same nucleus (e.g. NM to NM) or heterotypic coupling (e.g. NM to NL) will be investigated. The components mediating this communication will be identified and disrupted by gene transfection to investigate the role of cell coupling on migration patterns of these neurons. The proposed studies will provide integral information toward understanding the role of the auditory anlage in the development of these brainstem nuclei. ',\n",
       " ' Sensorineural deafness in adults is primarily due to the permanent loss of sensory hair cells in the inner ear. In this regard, mammals differ from lower vertebrates, which can regenerate sensory hair cells from adjacent supporting cells after injury. It is not known whether this difference arises from a lack of sensory developmental capacity in mammalian support cells, or from a lack of some endogenous stimulus in mammals to provoke regeneration after otic injury. Experiments described in this proposal will mark embryonic sensory and support cell precursors with a fluorescent transgene. These precursors will be purified from embryos using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and differentiated in vitro, using a recently developed culture system. This system will also be used to isolate and differentiate post-mitotic support cells from embryos and from post-natal animals. From these experiments, it will be determined whether post-mitotic mammalian support cells are able to generate sensory hair cells, and if so, how long in development this capacity persists.',\n",

The fulfillment of this goal will occur in two phases. The focus of phase one is the relationship between psychosocial factors and oral health outcomes in adults, and will be investigated through secondary analysis of data from the VA Dental Longitudinal Study (DLS) and Normative Aging Study (NAS). Two sets of questions will be addressed. The first concerns the relationship between three oral health constructs - clinical status, self-report of status, and oral health-related quality of life. The second set of questions concerns the disparity in oral health outcomes by socioeconomic condition. It is hypothesized that factors secondary to socioeconomic condition (e.g., insurance, access) serve as mediators between SES and oral health. Theory-based models of these relationships will be designed and tested using DLS and NAS data, including models of change in oral health status following changes in socioeconomic or mediating variables. The second phase will serve as an orientation to the area of childrens oral health research through the guided development and testing of a measure of oral health-related quality of life in children. This measure will then be used to facilitate future research in oral health-related quality of life, beyond the period covered by this fellowship.',\n",
       " ' Nitric oxide (NO), a gaseous free radical generated by the NO synthase (NOS) group of enzymes, regulates proliferation and function of osteoblasts. The objectives of this proposal are to determine the effect of mechanical stimulation on intracellular distribution, modification and enzyme activity of endothelial NOS (eNOS) and determine whether mechanically-induced regulation of osteoblast-associated genes is dependent upon NO release. Furthermore, the mechanism by which mechanically-inducible genes in osteoblasts potentially mediate osteoclast activity will be explored, and an in vivo model used to determine localization and level of expression of mechanically induced gene product. The study is based on the hypotheses that a response of osteoblasts to mechanical stimulation involves activation of constitutive NOS and regulation of NOS gene expression. The second hypothesis is that mechanically-induced NO release by osteoblasts influences osteoclast development and function. The majority of the proposed experiments will utilize the immortalized mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3P3-E1. Cell monolayers will be mechanically stimulated by application of fluid shear stress and by inducing strain by stretching cells on flexible membranes. Post-translational modifications of eNOS by mechanical treatment of osteoblasts will be examined by determining whether the enzyme is palmitoylated and or myristoylated. Subsequently, the changes in intracellular localization of the modified eNOS protein will be examined by determining the presence of eNOS in Triton-insoluble and Triton-soluble cellular fractions, and by observing the effect of mechanical treatment on eNOS intracellular distribution by immunofluorescence microscopy. The responses to mechanical stimulation of two earlier identified mechanosensitive genes (colony-stimulating factor-I and insulin-like growth factor-I) and two additional target genes (tumor necrosis factor and RANKL) will be assessed using RT-PCR, Northern blotting for mRNA and Western blotting for proteins. Dependence of mechanical responses of these genes upon NO release will be determined and the mechanism by which their protein products influence osteoclast activity will be explored. In addition, the possibility of a direct effect of osteoblastic NO on the formation and function of osteoclasts will be assessed in osteoclast-like cells RAW. Finally, localization and level of expression of NOS isoforms and other targeted osteoblast-associated genes will be evaluated in vivo, using dento-alveolar complex of mouse incisors.

       " ' In the anterior pituitary lactotroph cells, transcription or PRL is regulated in part by a defined group of DNA-binding factors including Pit-1, Ets-1 and ERF. A family of corepressor proteins, including SMRT and N-CoR, interact with diverse classes of DNA-binding factors to silence target genes. Although N-CoR has been shown to repress the activity of Pit-1, the role of corepressors in the inhibition of PRL gene transcription has not been defined. The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that SMRT interacts with multiple DNA-binding factors to inhibit PRL transcription, and that dynamic interactions altering the subnuclear architecture are involved in this process. To begin identifying DNA-binding factors that mediate SMRT-dependent repression of the PRL gene, coimmunoprecipitation from GH3 cell lysates will be used to identify interactions between SMRT and either Pit-1, Ets-1 or ERF. Deletional analysis of the SMRT protein will be used to delineate functional domains. The effect of SMRT on the prolactin promoter and isolated response elements will be examined using reporter gene assays in GH3 cells and in HeLa cells transiently expressing the DNA-binding factors. Importantly, the dynamic sub-nuclear organization of SMRT and associated DNA-binding factors will be determined in living pituitary cells. This will be accomplished by the use of proteins tagged with color variants of the jellyfish green fluorescent protein. Additionally, SMRT subnuclear localization will be correlated with regions of transcriptional silencing. It is expected that these studies will have far-reaching implications for the regulation of PRL gene expression and for mechanisms of transcriptional repression in general.',\n",
       " ' The overall goal is to understand how synaptic pathways in the postnatal mammalian retina develop and to understand how this development is influenced by visual experience. Disruption of the normal sensory experience during development of young animals can lead to permanent defects in nervous tissue including the retina. Rearing animals in the dark \"dark rearing\" interferes with the normal sensory input to the retina and results in an alteration in the excitatory inputs onto the output neurons in the retina, the retinal ganglion cells. Using patch clamp techniques, the ratio of evoked synaptic mediated currents in the retinal ganglion cells will be examined in the retinas of both normal and dark reared retina. The alteration in excitatory inputs onto the retinal ganglion cells suggests that there are changes in the release properties of bipolar cells. Retinal ganglion cells receive input from bipolar cells, which release glutamate in response to photoreceptor activity. The release properties of bipolar cells will be characterized by using patch-clamp techniques to record evoked responses in retinal ganglion cells in normal and dark reared retina. The expression and localization of a protein responsible for transporting the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate into synaptic vesicles of presynaptic terminals will be examined in developing retina, and in normal and dark reared retina. Characterization of the mechanisms involved in regulating synaptic activity in the developing retina is important baseline knowledge for understanding improper synaptic transmission in retinal dysfunction and disease.',\n",

It has been assumed that, because FEF is involved directly in the production of saccadic eye movements, that FEF is an effector specific region. However, this assumption has not been systematically tested. In the proposed research we will determine if the responses of neurons in FEF are effector dependent under varying conditions. First, we will determine whether FEF is an area involved in the maintenance of information in working memory, or is an area involved in the maintenance of information for a goal-directed eye movement. Second, we will examine whether FEF represents a salience map for visual targets in general, or for the targets of eye movements, in particular. Third, we will determine whether FEF is involved in the process by which an effector is selected, in the absence of any spatial information regarding the target of an effector. Finally, will examine how and where spatial information is integrated with information about the selection of an effector in FEF and the lateral intraparietal sulcus (LIP). ',\n",

One essential component of intracellular calcium dynamics is release of intracellular calcium stores via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), the IP3R regulates a behavioral rhythm - the periodic contraction of the posterior body wall muscles. The intestine controls the contraction of the overlying muscles in a nonautonomous fashion and intestinal calcium oscillations directly precede the muscle contraction.

       " ' (provided by the applicant): RNA interference, or post-transcriptional gene silencing, is common to a diverse set of eukaryotes. It is thought that RNAi defends against the invasion of RNA viruses by specifically targeting double-stranded RNA molecules for degradation. RNAi is also speculated to function in the regulation of gene expression and mobilization of transposable elements, but substantive evidence for these roles has not been obtained. This proposal is specifically intended to address the question of whether RNAi serves as a regulator of the expression of endogenous genes, a function implied by the phenotypes of Arabidopsis lines with mutations in genes involved in the mechanism of RNAi. Genes that are differentially expressed in wild-type and mutant backgrounds of Arabidopsis will be identified by hybridization of RNA populations to Affymetrix microarrays and bioinformatic analyses, and the altered expression of candidate genes will be verified by real-time RT-PCR. The function of genes identified by this approach will be examined by analyzing their mutant phenotypes, using an existing collection of transposon-based enhancer and gene trap lines, and by assessing RNA metabolism in wild type and mutant backgrounds. These experiments should yield fundamental insights into how RNAi influences the regulation of gene expression and genome stability, key issues in genome evolution and disease pathogenesis.',\n",

The plant epidermis is a particularly interesting tissue because it one of the first to be established, yet it continues to differentiate throughout the life of the plant, undergoing specialization to take up nutrients, optimize photosynthetic yields, and ensure reproductive success. The objective of this study is to identify molecules required for the initial formation of the epidermis and later for the development of one set of specialized epidermal types, the ovule integuments. The approach will be to identify, by mutation, (1) genes that are required for the correct localization of an epidermally-expressed reporter gene in the embryo, and (2) genes required for the specification of the integuments by screening for mutants that disturb seed shape and mucilage production. The mutants will be characterized with respect to their role in several epidermal patterning decisions, and the most interesting ones cloned. The information garnered by the analysis of these mutations will suggest ways in which a tissue initiates, expands and maintains its identity. This information may reveal regulatory circuits that are common to the establishment of other tissue types, or it may show that the epidermis has unique developmental patterns that relate to its functional role as the interface between the plant and the outside world. For the improvement of crop plants, knowledge about the epidermis is particularly relevant for the understanding and engineering of plant defenses and for production of plant biomaterials. ',\n",
       " ' Humans show considerable variation in trichromatic color vision, which is the presence of three retinal cones tuned to different wavelengths. Approximately 8 percent of Caucasian males, for example, show color vision abnormalities. This variation stands in contrast to the remarkable uniformity of vision found in Old World monkeys, apes, and the Neotropical genus of howling monkeys. Variations in these populations are extremely rare and, at the moment, it is unclear why trichromacy twice evolved so similarly in primates but in no other known mammal. The hypothesis that young, colored leaves may have selected for trichromatic color vision in primates has recently received support. Among mammals, however, molecular evidence on the color vision of specialized, non-primate frugivores and folivores is nonexistent. If indeed trichromacy is found in another mammal, it will refute the dogma that trichromacy is absent in non-primate mammals and, moreover, plausibly support one of the competing hypotheses for why it evolved. The Kloss gibbon, isolated for 500,000 years on the Mentawai Islands of Indonesia, is the most frugivorous ape ever observed. It may therefore model the conditions faced by our human ancestors and, like humans, may exhibit a high frequency of dichromacy. Molecular evidence on the color vision of the Kloss gibbon and a broad array of mammals with specialized diets will be obtained from DNA collected from a variety of sources, including feces and museum specimens. For the middle long wavelength opsin(s), PCR-based gene isolation strategies will be implemented. All exons from the 2-or3 possible opsins will be entirely sequenced. For some of the non-primate species, it will be necessary to develop complete or partial genomic libraries. This study thus aims to explore the issues, implications, and evolutionary significance of color vision variation.',\n",
       " ' In all sexually reproducing species, successful reproduction depends on multiple factors, such as endocrine milieu, the physical environment, and social interactions. It is well understood that individuals of both sexes employ strategies to enhance their own reproductive success. Increasing evidence suggests that often various traits reveal information about a males quality as a mate, either genetically or with respect to caring for offspring. An as yet understudied question concerns what factors affect female preferences for specific male traits. That is, does a females condition (e.g., health, nutritional status) or experience affect her preference for one type of trait over another Furthermore, in many systems, including monogamous species, individuals augment their reproductive success by mating with conspecifics other than their social mates. Another largely understudied question is whether females prefer different traits for social mates and for extra-pair partners. Songbirds provide an excellent system in which to investigate these questions because females often exhibit preferences for both morphological and behavioral traits and males often provide a relatively high degree of parental care. Using the songbird dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) as a model, the hypotheses that will be tested in this proposal are that male traits indicate future paternal care and that the condition and experience of a female affects her preferences for morphological versus behavioral male traits. Also, the male phenotypes that females prefer for their social mates will be compared to those of their extra-pair partners. These studies will further our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying the behavioral regulation of sexual behavior and reproduction, including the influence of the endocrine system, social factors, and the physical environment.',\n",

The overarching hypothesis is that a large source of the variability among individuals is rooted in the ability to resolve the competition that arises as a result of two languages being activated. The proposal is comprised of four experiments, each of which includes a battery of tasks designed to measure individual differences in first language (L1) cognitive processing. Tasks will include working memory span, Stroop color naming, L1 grammaticality judgment, and task switching. The first experiment will assess the degree to which L2 learners rely on their L1 to translate words and name pictures, and to detect grammatical errors in L2 sentences. In the second experiment, participants will learn novel words in association with pictures of either familiar or novel objects, in order to assess whether L2 words can be learned more easily when there are no competing L1 words. Experiment 3 will use a bilingual picture-word interference task and an agent identification task to compare the effects of competition at the lexical and syntactic levels. Experiment 4 will consist of a variety of bilingual switching tasks that will examine the ability of L2 learners to rapidly control the relative levels of activation of each language.',\n",
       " ' (provided by applicant) Because of the numerous functions they perform during morphogenesis, much of the understanding of TGFB signal transduction stems from studies in developing embryos. However, as these observations rely primarily on examination of TGFI3 ligands and their receptors, a more complete understanding of their role in embryogenesis requires direct observation of when and where TGFB signals are activated. To accomplish this, an antibody has been generated recognizing the active, phosphorylated form of Smads 1, 5, and 8, which transduces signaling by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), a subset of the TGFBs. This antibody will be used to characterize the pattern of Smad l5 8 phosphorylation in post-gastrula Xenopus embryos. In addition, methods for conditional gene expression will be validated. These will be used to conditionally activate and inhibit endogenous BMP signaling in order examine functional requirements for BMPs after gastrulation. Finally, preliminary observations reveal a domain of Srnadll5 8 phosphorylation in presumptive neural crest cells. Experiments are proposed to address mechanisms by which domains of BMP signaling are established during neural crest specification and functional requirements for BMPs at specific times during neural crest development.',\n",
       " 'Hematopoiesis is the induction of self-renewing stem cells (HSC), and their subsequent maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation into all the blood cell lineages. Dysregulation of hematopoietic development can lead to leukemia and other stem cell disorders. The HSC are derived from a bipotential precursor, the hemangioblast, which gives rise to both blood and endothelial cells. We have chosen to take a genetic approach in zebrafish and isolate novel genes important in HSC specification. As part of a large-scale mutagenesis screen, we are identifying zebrafish with mutations that result in altered expression of SCL, the earliest known specifier of hemangioblasts, as detected by RNA in situ hybridization, or aberrant blood morphology at day 4 by visual inspection under a dissecting microscope. This will generate a complete collection of mutations from HSC induction through early hematopoietic development. The mutants identified will be further characterized using molecular markers for genes expressed in both ventral mesoderm and blood. The identification and characterization of such novel genes, and the positioning of these genes and known genes in the genetic pathway of early hematopoiesis, will provide potential new targets far drug design in the treatment of leukemia and other stem cell disorders.

       " 'Embryonic blood vessel development requires the differentiation of mesodermal cells into migratory endothelial cells that form tubular vessels, in nearby or distant tissues, in a reproducible manner. The molecular signals involved in this patterning process have not yet been fully defined. We hypothesize that the precursor cells are not intrinsically programmed but respond to exogenous signals for patterning cues, such as vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) secreted from the neural tube. Analyzing mesodermal tissue from mouse embryos in a three-dimensional collagen-gel culture-system will test this hypothesis. Specifically, the aims are to determine if murine paraxial mesoderm has vasculogenic potential in explant culture and to determine if VEGF is involved in the three dimensional patterning of blood vessels.

       " 'The ability to select particular objects or features from the environment which are particularly relevant to a desired behavior is called attention, and is an emergent property of the nervous system. An understanding of the neural basis of attention will have far- reaching implications, since the selection of objects for attention involves systems for learning and memory in addition to sensory processing. Understanding the basic mechanisms in the brain which mediate attention will aid the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders in which attentional mechanisms are affected. This project will investigate how the optic tectum may mediate auditory stimulus selection in the barn owl; specifically, do neural responses in the optic tectum of the barn owl differentiate between attended and ignored auditory targets Previous studies of the role of the optic tectum or superior colliculus in the control of gaze have not examined the representation or selection of multiple targets, as simultaneous recordings from multiple sites of the tectum have not been feasible. In this experiment, the use of multiple, chronically-implanted electrodes will allow examination of how multiple stimuli are represented in the tectum, and whether activity related to target selection may be found therein.

To determine whether IL-1beta is acting at the dorsal hippocampus to produce memory impairments, contextual fear will be tested in rats which receive an (a) LPS (peripheral) or (b) IL-1 beta (central) injection while endogenous dorsal hippocampal IL-1 beta is being inhibited with IL-I receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). To determine whether the source of brain-derived IL-l beta is neuronal and or glial, (a) single- and (b) double-label immunohistochemical studies will be conducted to detect cell type and cell content in hippocampus following a peripheral injection of LPS. To explore whether IL- l beta impairs contextual fear by altering dorsal hippocampal glutamate release, in vivo microdialysis studies will be conducted to measure (a) unstimulated and (b) KCl-stimulated glutamate release following a peripheral injection of LPS. If LPS induces alterations in glutamate release, IL-1ra will be infused into the sampling region to determine whether such alterations are mediated specifically by IL-1 beta. These studies will answer some important questions about where and how pro-inflammatory cytokines may act to impair hippocampal-dependent memory processes.',\n",
       " 'As the numbers of adolescents and young adults with HIV continue to increase, it becomes important to develop medication adherence interventions for a group with historically low rates of adherence. Among adults living with HIV, one of the most consistently significant predictors of medication non-adherence has been depression or the presence of depressive symptomatology (Singh et al., 1996; Chesney et al., 1996). Depression has also been found to be a significant predictor of medication non-adherence among HIV-positive adolescents (Hosek, 2000). This research project aims to expand the existing HIV adherence literature by exploring the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral depression coping skills intervention in increasing medication adherence among HIV-infected youth. Adolescents and young adults infected with HIV will be recruited from a large midwestern public medical facility and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the standard-care comparison group. The results from this project are important in the development and implementation of larger interventions aimed at increasing medication adherence within this population. ',\n",
       " ' An interest in applying behavior genetic techniques to family research and an understanding of the gaps in the sibling and marital literature led to this study of genetic and environmental factors contributing to associations between personality, sibling and marital relationships and adjustment in adults. Three samples from the Swedish Twin Registry will be used to investigate the role that personality plays in associations between adult interpersonal relationships and adjustment: Young Twins, Twin Moms, and the Swedish Adoption Twin Study of Aging. Multivariate analyses will be used to address the specific aims of this study: 1) examine associations between adult interpersonal relationships and adjustment across the lifespan by a) identifying genetic and environmental influences underlying associations of adult sibling and marital relationships with adjustment, and b) examining genetic and environmental on the influence of interactions between adult sibling and marital relationships on adjustment: 2) employ genetically informed designs to specify how personality characteristics influence interpersonal relationships and ensuing adjustment. A review of the family research and behavior genetic literature indicated the following set of expectations. 1) Prior findings of associations between sibling relationships and adjustment will be replicated. Shared environmental influences may be important. but it is not entirely clear how genetic and environmental factors will contribute to these associations. 2) Previous findings of associations between marital quality and mental health will be replicated. It is expected that these associations will be explained by genetic and nonshared environmental factors. 3) The proposed analyses will contribute the first findings on associations between adult sibling relationships and marital relationships, and the genetic and environmental factors contributing to the association. 4) The proposed study will report the first findings on how personality affects sibling relationships in later life. Findings are expected to replicate previous findings of links between personality and marital relationships. Contributions will also be made to the debate on intrapersonal models vs. interpersonal models of influence.',\n",
       " ' Gaining a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which we acquire and process language is a critical first step in the development of strategies to aid those with acquired or developmental language deficits. Many direct methods for investigating the neural basis of language are unavailable because, unlike other domains of cognitive psychology such as vision or memory, language has no real non-human correlate. Therefore, we must rely more heavily on computational models, in conjunction with behavioral measures, to induce the workings of the language system. Connectionist models, in particular, offer the potential to provide novel explanations for many critical questions in the study of language, including the means by which children are able to learn language in noisy environments with limited feedback, how learning of a second language differs in adulthood and childhood, and how semantic, pragmatic, and discourse information is rapidly integrated with syntactic knowledge during comprehension. But connectionist models have so far been applied to only a limited number of the many complex aspects of language. The main goal of this proposal is to further develop, refine, and evaluate a connectionist model aimed at accounting for a broad range of sentence processing phenomena. Predictions of the model will be tested using self-paced reading-time and possibly eye-tracking measures. The model will also be studied to determine the general principles that characterize its behavior. Additional parts of the proposed project will study the induction of word meaning from large text corpora and explore the effects of experience on second language learning in connectionist networks.',\n",
       " ' The project uses a comparative approach to study two behavioral strategies employed in biological systems to optimize the speed and accuracy of spatial search. The two systems studied are human saccadic eye-movement, and path integration in honeybees. Both systems must solve the problems of moving a sensor through an environment to a desired goal. They have separately evolved two strategies to increase the speed and accuracy of this search: an open-loop movement and use of memory. While the open-loop saccadic eye-movement is reasonably well understood, there is very little known about its use of visual memory. In contrast, spatial memory in insect navigation is becoming well understood, but there is still a great deal to understand about how memory interacts with path integration. The experiments in this proposal will attempt to redress the balance by studying the use of spatial memory for saccadic eye-movements, and how spatial memories are used by the insect path integration system. With these studies, the conceptual relationship between two systems, which are occasionally presented together as examples of similar processes, will be better understood.',\n",
       " 'How does a single neuron establish and maintain many functionally distinct synapses How are specific synaptic proteins added and removed from specific synapses to regulate signal transmission efficiency Recent evidence suggests that changes in post-synaptic protein distribution constitute a cell biological mechanism leading to long term potentiation and long term depression, which are believed to form the basis of memory and learning. It was previously shown that a phylogenetically conserved PDZ-domain containing protein (LIN-10) is required for targeting of an AMPA-type glutamate receptor (GluR) to central synapses in C. elegans. This synaptic function of LIN- 10 is likely to be phylogenetically conserved since a human orthologue (X11 Mint) can functionally replace the endogenous worm protein. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism by which LIN-10 regulates the abundance of GluR localization at post-synaptic elements as a step towards understanding the dynamic regulation of synaptic protein localization. A comparison with the function of LIN-10 in epithelial cells will test the hypothesis that a basic mechanism for protein localization is common in both cell types. ',\n",
       " ' The long-term objective of this proposal is to study the role of HuD, a neuronal-specific RNA-binding protein that selectively interacts with GAP-43, during regeneration of axotomized rubrospinal neurons in the mouse. These studies will provide the base knowledge necessary to study molecular events occurring in other motorneuron tracts of the central nervous system after spinal cord injury. The first specific aim is to examine the spatial and temporal expression patterns of HuD protein and GAP-43 mRNA in the red nucleus before and after rubrospinal tractotomy. To accomplish this immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization will be used on tissue sections of mice subjected to a C3 hemisection of the dorsolateral funiculus compared to sham-operated controls. The second specific aim is to use gene-activating matrices (GAM) to overexpress genes and determine the subsequent response both in the red nucleus and in axotomized axons. To achieve this aim a gene-activating matrix containing HuD cDNA will be implanted into the injury site to transduce cells and examine whether this will promote GAP-43 expression and sprouting of axons across the wound. Concurrently, it will determine if exogenous HuD can undergo retrograde transport to the cell body of an injured neuron and become constitutively expressed, thereby altering endogenous GAP-43 expression. In addition, a GAM containing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) cDNA in combination with HuD will be used to amplify and prolong the effects of overexpressing HuD alone. Tract-tracing will be used to determine if regenerating axons sprout into or around the wound site after injury. The third aim will involve the use of ribonomics technology to identify genes target by HuD and BDNF during regeneration of the red nucleus. These studies have the potential of directly impacting SCI in humans as HuD is endogenously expressed in humans and may be a useful candidate in gene therapy to manipulate the temporal expression of GAP-43 during regeneration.

       " ' Parkinsons disease (PD) is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies, the cytoplasmic neuronal inclusions, in the substantia nigra. One major component of the Lewy bodies was identified to be the fibril a-synuclein, thus linked the accumulation of this protein to the pathogenesis of PD. Failure to regulate the concentration of a-synuclein can contribute to the build-up and consequently fibrillization of the protein. The objective of this proposed research is to investigate the degradation process of a-synuclein through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Neuronal ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1) hydrolyzes C-terminal ester and amides of ubiquitin and is believed to play a key role in processing polyubiquitin and or ubiquitylated proteolytic peptide. A mutation (I93M) of the enzyme has been linked to a rare early-onset form of PD, at the same time a polymorphism of the enzyme (S18Y) was indicated to reduce the risk of PD. By direct comparing the specific activities of the wild-type and mutant UCH-L1 enzymes using techniques in biochemistry, biophysics and molecular biology, we hope we will have a better understanding of the degradation pathway of a-synuclein and the role of the UCH-L1 in the proteasome.',\n",

       " 'The overall goal of the proposed research is to understand how the neural system coordinates axial trunk movement. We are currently unable to directly determine the forces produced by muscle activation, nor accurately measure morphology and motion of the skeletal system in-vivo. However, using both inverse and forward-dynamics modeling techniques allows investigation of these variables. We may then explore the relationship between the mechanical requirements of the task, and the coordination necessary to perform the task. The first specific aim is to identify the critical factors that determine success or failure of a normal sit-up. Using the model for simulation allows us to determine the sensitivity of the movement outcome to changes in motor control strategy such as altered muscle activation timing and or intensity. The second specific aim is to characterize task failure in selected groups of subjects. Approximately 5% of the population have difficulties performing tasks requiring movement of the axial trunk, such as the situp. This is possibly due to a mechanical disadvantage caused by their morphology, or by inappropriate coordination of the task. Farther simulation will enable us to determine the changes in motor strategy required to complete the task. In addition, normal subjects have been shown to be able to adapt their motor strategy to overcome novel mechanical conditions. By modeling the changes that occurred, we may begin to understand how the neural system organizes the motor control strategy to perform axial movement. ',\n",

Its overall goal will be to evaluate the limits of adaptive changes in the relationship between spinal circuits and the musculoskeletal system when this interaction is disrupted. In each of the projects this disruption will be studied in model systems using transection and surgical repair of peripheral nerves. In Project I (English), the capacity for spontaneous adaptation, the effects of treadmill training, and operant conditioning of spinal reflexes on the outputs of spinal circuits will be studied after sciatic nerve transection in rats. The effectiveness of combining these approaches with protocols known to enhance the early regeneration of axons in injured peripheral nerves will be determined. In Project II (Gregor), the roles of short term compensatory strategies on longer term adaptive changes will be studied after transection and surgical repair of a single muscle nerve in cats. Using kinetic, kinematic, and EMG analyses, the extent of compensation by connective tissues, the effects of enhancing axon regeneration, and the roles played by cutaneous sensory systems in these changes will be studied. In Project III (Nichols), the roles played by different forms of proprioceptive feedback in the functional deficit following surgical reinnervation of the main cat plantar flexor muscles will be studied. Using acute and chronic experiments in conjunction with biomechanical modeling, the mechanisms underlying both short term compensation and longer term adaptation will be elucidated. Using intense treadmill ramp training during the recovery period, the preservation of normal reflexes will be studied.

       " 'Fragile X syndrome is a leading cause of mental retardation in humans. The molecular basis of fragile X syndrome is the expansion of a trinucleotide repeat within the FMR1 gene, leading to the absence of the encoded protein, FMRP. Although there has been a spectacular increase in the understanding of this disorder in recent years, it is now time for a well focused, multidisciplinary group effort to further elucidate the molecular basis of fragile X syndrome. Seven interrelated and collaborative project at Emory University School of Medicine are proposed. These projects dramatically expand the scope of contemporary fragile X syndrome research and specifically address issues crucial for future investigation and intervention. Clues to the mechanism(s) of repeat expansion will be sought and exploited. The consequence of repeat expansion, the transcriptional suppression of FMR1, will be investigated to understand the mechanism leading to the absence of FMRP. Understanding the biochemistry of FMRP will be highlighted with studies aimed at understanding the structural determinants of FMRP:RNA interaction, including the role of FMRP isoforms; the role of FMRP on protein translation and the consequence of its absence on neuronal protein synthesis; the localization of FMRP in mammalian brain, particularly within neuronal somatal-dendritic compartments, and the consequence of its absence on dendritic complexity and dendritic spine morphology. Model systems are proposed to further drive these studies to greater levels of understanding. A model system will be developed in yeast investigating yeast genes whose products are of similar structure to FMRP and the result of vertebrate FMRP expression within yeast will be investigated. A mammalian cellular system to assess FMRP function will be developed based upon the ability of excess FMRP to transform 3T3 cells in culture. Finally, a new generation of Fmr1 knockout mice will be developed in which FMRP expression can be temporally and quantitatively controlled, both pre- and postnatally, by drug exposure. Fundamental questions relating to future therapeutic strategies will be directly addressed. It is anticipated that this proposed investigation into fragile X syndrome by a highly interactive and multidisciplinary team of proven collaborative abilities will result in a synergistic increase in knowledge of this important disorder and a broader understanding of a common form of mental retardation.

In this Center we exploit functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neurobiological mechanisms, specifically, the functional organization of linguistic processes in children and young adults with a range of reading abilities and disabilities (including RD and hyperlexia). Project I uses fMRI to begin to examine the neural basis of attentional processes in ADHD, to determine the neurobiological \"signature\" for ADHD; the same cohort is studied in Project II using event related potentials (ERPs). Project IV examines the functional organization of brain in children with RD, before, during and after a highly focused phonological intervention. In Project V we use fMRI to study phonological and semantic processing in a group of hyperlexics. Finally, in Project III, the availability of an epidemiologic sample followed longitudinally with yearly measures of reading, offers an unprecedented opportunity to link neural mechanisms of reading ability and disability in children to the developmental course and longterm outcome of reading from kindergarten through young adulthood. In Project III, we use fMRI to study the neurologic residua of childhood RD in both compensated and persistently poor readers. ',\n",
       " 'The goal of this SCOR application is to identify and characterize key risk factors for thrombosis that will improve methods for its prevention and treatment. The SCOR is specifically designed to promote synergy between basic and clinical research. It includes a randomized, prospective clinical trial to address the optimal duration of oral anticoagulant therapy for venous thrombosis (Project 1), a physiological study of the role of IL-6 in augmenting thrombosis (Project 4), and biochemical projects that examine the role of phospholipids and anti- phospholipid antibodies in the protein C pathway (Project 2), the membrane requirements for the tissue factor factor VII pathway (Project 3), and the role of cytokines and other mediators in regulating the expression of P-selectin (Project 5). There is significant overlap in the scientific goals of the laboratory-based projects. In addition, an essential link for all SCOR components is the Assay Core, which will perform coagulation, ELISA, and DNA assays on blood samples from the patients in Project 1. The data from these assays will help answer mechanistic questions in the laboratory-oriented projects, which, in turn, will help define specific risk factors for recurrent thrombosis in the patients of Project 1. The SCOR is organized to facilitate generation and testing of hypotheses that will move between the basic and clinical arenas. The long-term objective is better understand the etiology of thrombosis, thereby allowing design of better treatment strategies. ',\n",
       " 'This proposal combines basic and clinical research approaches to the development, injury and repair of the perinatal lung that underlie bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), the major causes of chronic lung disease (CLD) of infancy. Project 1 employs a mouse model of glucocorticoid deficiency based on targeted deletion of the corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) gene. The role of glucocorticoids in normal and dysplastic fetal lung development will be analyzed by identifying cellular targets of steroid action, characterizing the role of cell-cell interactions and paracrine factors in downstream signaling, and determining whether lung-derived CRH plays a role in lung maturation. Project 2 analyzes the role of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, syndecans, their shedding into the extracellular spaces, and their inducers in modifying the action of heparin-binding effectors involved in the developmental response to injury. Project 3 explores the possibility that heparin- binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a potent mitogen for smooth muscle (SM) cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, is involved in the response of the lung to injury. Mechanisms that regulate HB-EGF synthesis and bioactivity in normal and abnormal lungs, and HB-EGF antagonists that might control abnormal lung cell proliferation will be studies. Projects 4 and 5 will function in concert to analyze the cellular and molecular mechanisms that the lung uses to control pulmonary vascular SM cell contractility and growth. These responses to injury become deregulated during the pathogenesis of PPHN. Project 4 focuses on gene regulation by hypoxia, and the interaction of endothelial-derived vasoconstrictors and vasodilators in a rat model of hypoxia-induced pulmonary remodeling as well as in infants with PPHN. Project 5 is based on the finding that changes in cell-extracellular matrix interactions in response to these endothelial-derived factors can modulate pulmonary vascular SM cell by altering integrin-dependent signaling mechanisms. These signals, elicited by ECM and soluble vasoagonists, may be blocked by integrin antagonists, possible inhibitors of hypoxia-induced pulmonary remodeling in the rat model. Each project will have a close collaboration with the Clinical Core which will (i) formulate testable clinical hypotheses based on insights from the laboratory studies, (ii) provide samples and data from patients with BPD and PPHN, and (iii) generate statistical analyses and study designs. Project 7, the Administrative Core, will orchestrate these interdisciplinary efforts, manage the distribution of funds and efforts and create a SCOR research community. Our integrated search approach to the critical problem of CLD of infancy will facilitate development of new methods for its prevention and therapy. ',\n",
       " 'Biochemical and molecular processes related to initiation and progression of the atherosclerotic lesion have yet to be fully defined. This SCOR program is an interdisciplinary approach to the study of thrombotic disease and angiogenesis as it relates to atherogenesis. How these processes relate at the cellular and molecular level will be a significant theme of the program. Our investigation will include a genetic engineering approach employing several animal models of the disease (mouse CD36 and apo E knockout models, rat angioplasty model, and the rabbit atherosclerosis model) to address: scavenger receptors in foam cell development, fibrinolytic factors and tissue-remodeling in angiogenesis, mitogenic factors in the formation of the coronary network and patterning of coronary vessels, and the molecular deficiencies associated with growth control of atherosclerotic cells using dominant-negative constructs to specific growth factor receptor genes. To address these objectives, a Molecular Biology Gene Transfer Core has been constructed to facilitate investigations involving gene transfer, gene regulation, and maintenance of the genetically-modified animal models. In addition, a gene therapy approach will be used to develop clinical strategies for the induction of angiogenesis. Emphasis has also been placed on the use of clinical samples consisting of human atherosclerotic and restenotic tissues. These materials will be studies in an effort to extend the paradigms resulting from the use of genetically modified animal models to advance our understanding of human lesion progression. Our SCOR program has been crafted to capitalize on the complimentary research expertise of our cardiovascular biology group at Cornell. Together, our synergistic efforts have culminated in over 100 peer-reviewed, basic research papers in the past 5 years, underscoring the success of our scientific collaborations. As a testament to our achievements, Cornell Medical School has recently developed a new Center of Vascular Biology, headed by Dr. David Hajjar.

       " 'The experiments proposed in this SCOR in Molecular Medicine and Atherosclerosis share common themes and focus in a highly interactive program to investigate signaling involved in normal growth and differentiation of vascular tissue as well as abnormal growth that leads to atherosclerosis. A two pronged approach to atherosclerosis is proposed: 1) By understanding the growth factors, receptors and signaling proteins involved in normal vascular development and abnormal angiogenesis it may be possible to stimulate capillary growth in damaged tissues. A clinical project to investigate this possibility in human heart is proposed. 2) An understanding of the factors and signaling proteins involved in regulation of growth, migration and adhesion may also provide novel drug targets to block atherosclerosis and restenosis. Six related projects are proposed: 1) The Role of TIE-1 and TIE-2 in Pathological Blood Vessels; 2) Genetic Disorders of Vascular Development and Signaling; 3) Regulatory Elements in the PDGF-A Chain Gene and their use in directing Cell-Type Specific Gain and Loss of Function Mutations into the Vascular System of Mice. 4) The Role of PTP1 mu and SHPTP2 in Endothelial Cells, 5) Pathways of Integrin Activation and Actin Polymerization in Vascular Cells and 6) Stimulation of Human Coronary Angiogenesis with Basic FGF. These projects are enhanced by a Transgenic and Tissue-Specific Expression Core, a Protein Expression Core and an Administrative Core. Experiments will use the tools of cellular and molecular biology, protein chemistry, pathology, and clinical medicine. The program will be synergistically facilitated by exchange of reagents and technology, by extensive internal and external review, and by common core programs. It is anticipated that this program will advance research in this area by an emphasis on common themes and interactions, sharing the results of research efforts both within the SCOR and elsewhere and training of new scientists with interests in related basic and clinical areas within the rich environment of Harvard Medical School.

Resources of the John A. Burns School of Medicine, the Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) Program, and the Hawaii State Department of Health are integrated to provide infrastructure for the Hawaii ACTU. The project will be directed by Dr. Margo Heath-Chiozzi who has five years of prior ACTG experience. Current procedures will be used for the conduct of clinical trials including data management, quality assurance monitoring, investigational drug management, and laboratory specimen processing. Immunologic and virologic laboratory tests will be conducted in ACTG-certified laboratories at the University of California, Los Angeles. The Hawaii ACTU plans to enroll approximately 80 patients per year in phase II III antiretroviral studies, opportunistic infection treatment and prophylaxis studies, and Kaposi's sarcoma treatment studies. Outreach strategies will be specifically focused for statewide recruitment from Oahu and the Neighbor Islands of under-represented groups including Asian Pacific Islanders, injection drug users, women and adolescents. The scientific capabilities of the Hawaii ACTU will be utilized to develop new protocols which examine the unique aspects of HIV-infected patients in Hawaii such as the use of antiretroviral agents in minority patients who have concurrent infections with Hepatitis B or HTLV-I. The professional development of minority investigators from Hawaii will be facilitated through participation on protocol teams and ACTG scientific and resource committees.

       " \" The objective of the Specialized Cooperative Centers Program in Reproduction Research (SCCPRR) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine is to conduct innovative basic and clinical research on female and male reproductive biology and to apply the knowledge gained from these studies to improve understanding of the etiology and treatment of reproductive dysfunction and infertility in women and men. The thematic focus of this proposal is the role that estrogen plays in regulating maturation of primate fetal ovaries and testes during intrauterine development and vascular remodeling of the uterine endometrium during the menstrual cycle. In Project I (Gerald J. Pepe), the regulatory role of estrogen in utero in programming fetal ovarian follicular and oocyte development and the impact this has on fertility in adulthood will be assessed in the baboon. In Project II (Eugene D. Albrecht), the regulatory role of estrogen in utero in programming baboon fetal testicular and excurrent ductule epididymal development and the impact this has on fertility in adulthood will be assessed. A combined clinical-basic research study is proposed in Project III (Robert D. Koos), to determine the role of estrogen and progesterone, acting via expression of angiostimulatory and angioinhibitory factors, on endometrial angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in vivo in baboons and in vitro in cocultures of human endometrial and vascular endothelial and mural cells. We will collaborate with experts in human and nonhuman primate reproductive biology at the University of Maryland SCCPRR, Eastern Virginia Medical School, the University of Pittsburgh SCCPRR, and the Johns Hopkins University SCCPRR. Each of the research projects will draw heavily upon the immunocytochemistry Core (Gloria E. Hoffman) for the cellular localization expression of regulatory factors and receptors. Integration of the scientific effort in this SCCPRR will be achieved through the thematic focus on estrogen's role in developmental maturation of the reproductive system, use of the baboon as a nonhuman primate model, and an established tradition of collaborative research. The discoveries obtained in the baboon primate model are expected to translate to the human to advance knowledge of human reproductive biology. \",\n",
       " 'The study of human eye movements provides an extremely useful approach to the examination of a variety of cognitive functions. It is obvious that the latency and goal saccadic eye movements are related to attention. What is not so obvious is that other aspects of cognition such as short term memory, preparatory set, and inhibition of context inappropriate responses can also be assessed using eye movement techniques. Short term memory, preparatory set, and inhibition of context inappropriate responses constitute core functions of the prefrontal cortex, the brain region most involved in the control of higher order cognitive processes. We have used a number of different tasks to elicit saccades. Primary among these have been a variety of delayed response tasks. These tasks allow us to independently assess core functions of the prefrontal cortex by measuring the accuracy and latency of memory guided saccades, as well as the frequency of context inappropriate saccades that interrupt the delay period. Using these tasks we have demonstrated that schizophrenics are impaired in all three core aspects of prefrontal cortex function while children with ADHD are impaired in only their ability to inhibit context inappropriate saccades. Studies of alcoholics and children at risk for alcoholism are planned. ',\n",
       " 'NMR experiments were performed to study the influence of the degree of fatty acid unsaturation and headgroup composition on (i) lipid-lipid interaction, (ii) peptide-lipid interaction, and (iii) alcohol-lipid interaction. (i) Lipid-lipid interaction. The influence of polyunsaturation on the conformation and motional properties of phosphatidylcholine bilayers is being studied. The investigation of the phase diagram of (18:0) (22:6) PE is in progress. Changes in the average order of hydrocarbon methylene segments are interpreted as a change in the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer. The lamellar-hexagonal phase transition temperature is used to quantitate membrane stress acting on proteins incorporated into bilayers of polyunsaturated lipids. (ii) Peptide-lipid interaction. Secondary peptide structure, lipid organization, and the strength of peptide-lipid interaction are strongly correlated. The amphipathic peptide P828 changes its secondary structure upon interaction with negatively charged DOPG and causes formation of DOPG domains in DOPG DOPC mixtures. Experiments with tannic acid show that high concentration of hydroxyl groups at molecular surfaces facilitate the interaction of molecules with the lipid water interface. NMR methods have been developed to verify the transmembrane orientation of a hydrophobic helical peptide. A small amount of the peptide alamethicin in DEPE or DOPE DOPC (3 1) membranes converts the lamellar lipid phase into a cubic phase. (iii) Alcohol lipid interaction. The interaction of ethanol with phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine is being studied. Partially hydrated membranes interact strongly with ethanol. The amount of bound ethanol decreases with increasing water lipid ratios. We speculate that the strength of ethanol-lipid interaction is related to water activity. ',\n",
       " \"The molecular mechanisms of alcohol's actions in the nervous system are not known. This project combined molecular, biological and electrophysiological techniques to study the mechanisms of alcohol action on neural systems. The recombinant NMDA receptor subunits ~1, n1 ~1, n2 ~1, n3 ~1, were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and their sensitivity to ethanol was investigations using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. NMDA-activated currents associated with n1 ~1 or n2 ~1 subunits, were significantly inhibited by 50 Mm ethanol, whereas NMDA currents associated with ~1 or n3 ~1 subunits were not. Since NMDA receptor subunits are differentially distributed throughout the brain, the observations suggest that the differential sensitivity of NMDA receptor subunits to ethanol may contribute to the differences in ethanol sensitivity observed in different types of neurons. A possible role of phosphorylation in ethanol inhibition of NMDA-activated ion current was investigated using subunits n1 ~1. Phorbol 12-myristrate 13-acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), increased the amplitude of NMDA current. After treatment with 1 uM TPA for 10 min, the inhibition of NMDA current by 100 Mm ethanol increased from 32% to 47%. Staurosporin, an inhibitor of PKC, had no significant effect on the inhibitory action of ethanol, but blocked the effect of TPA. The effect of ethanol was also studied on recombinant 5-HT3 receptors in Xenopus oocytes. Ethanol concentrations from 20 to 40 Mm potentiated, in a concentration-dependent manner, currents activated by 250 Nm or 500 Nm 5-HT; the EC50 was 126 Mm. With 1 Um or greater, potentiation of 5-HT current was not observed. The observations suggest that molecular biological techniques may be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of alcohol's actions on neurotransmitter receptors. \",\n",

This involves development of a battery of 200 highly polymorphic marker loci that span the human genome at approximately 10-15 centimorgan intervals. We are using florescent dye technology and constructing panels of 10-20 loci that can be run simultaneously in one gel lane. This will facilitate fast and accurate data collection. Computer programs are being written to interface between the gel analysis machinery and a statistical database. In addition, we are developing methods for PCR-STR optimization and for precise STR allele determinations. As more genotypes are collected in the next year, we will begin linkage analyses using sequential likelihood and affected relative pair methods. The informativeness of STR markers bestows new and heretofore unattainable power for establishing, and excluding, genetic linkage between definable chromosome segments and genetic vulnerability to disease.

Tests for allele frequency differences between tribal groupings based on cultural and linguistic affinities will be performed. This information is important to genetic linkage and disease association studies on Native Americans because poor estimates of allele frequencies can result in false evidence for linkage, and allelic heterogeneity among groups can create spurious associations with disease.

       " \"In Orientals, genetic deficiency of ALDH2 is associated with the flushing reaction, an adverse response to alcohol. The allele ALDH-2-2 with the transition G C-greater than A T 12 bp from the 3'-end of exon 12 is responsible for the deficiency. Our primer-allele-specific amplification assay (PASA) of exon 12 did not reveal the existence of the same allele in South American Indians in whom the enzyme deficiency has been reported. This negative finding prompted further search for the possible mutations across the entire coding sequence of the ALDH-2 gene within a sample of 35 South American Indians from seven tribes. A RT-PCR assay detected low levels of ALDH-2 expression in human lymphoblasts. This allowed us to develop a RT-PCR-SSCP assay to detect mutations in the coding sequence. The coding sequence of ALDH-2 cDNA was PCR amplified as partially overlapped fragments. Each fragment was digested with restriction endonuclease, and subfragments of 148-285 bp in length were subjected to single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Thus far, two rare SSCP variants have been detected in the proximal (3'-end) part of ALDH-2 gene that corresponds to exons 11-13. These variants are being sequenced and the search for mutations is being continued in the middle part of the coding sequence and in the 5'flanking (promoter) region. \",\n",
       " 'Using a whole genome scan, we will assess genetic linkage to alcoholism and associated psychiatric disorders in Choctaw American Indians. Choctaw is a large Eastern North American Indian tribe with over 30,000 enrolled members living within tribal boundaries in Oklahoma. By contrast to neighboring American Indian tribes that have high prevalences of alcoholism, this tribe stands out because alcoholism has a low prevalence, about 1% and 10% of females and males, respectively. By studying American Indians in the context low alcoholism, we can expect to reveal different insights into the roles of genetic and or environmental determinants of alcoholism. Genetic analysis is to be conducted using three samples from the tribe: a small random sample (N=100), 3 large extended families (N>80 per family), and a sample of more than 150 admixed nuclear families. The admixed nuclear families will be selected to have some Euro-american ancestry and at least one alcoholic family member. The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) is the linkage analysis method of principal interest, because it has been shown to have increased power with population admixture. However, the sampling design will also accommodate standard non-parametric two- and multi-point linkage methods. These methods will be useful for high resolution mapping of promising chromosomal regions identified by the TDT. In order to perform the analyses outlined above, individual psychiatric interviews and blood samples will be collected. Research diagnoses will be made from the psychiatric interviews and DNA for genotyping will be extracted from the blood samples. For the linkage analysis, we expect to type up to 500 short tandem repeat DNA polymorphisms spanning the entire human genome. ',\n",
       " 'We previously cloned and demonstrated four distinct types of regulation of P450llE1. During the past year, we demonstrated two additional mechanisms of P450llE1 regulation: translational activation of P45OllE1 by isoniazid and pyrazine; and pretranslational suppression of hepatic P45OllE1 during pregnancy. Specific translational induction of P45OllE1 by isoniazid and pyrazine was demonstrated. However, pyridazine and pyrimidine, two stereoisomers of pyrazine, did not activate P45OllE1, indicating a more inflexible structural requirement for P450llE1 mRNA translation into its protein. In contrast, pyrrole with five-membered ring structure reduced P45OllE1 activity resulting from rapid reversal (within 1 day) upon parturition were also demonstrated. Exogenously administered steroids (progesterone, estrogen, and thyroxine) and peptide growth factors (placental lactogen, prolactin, and growth hormone) did not cause significant changes in P45OllE1 level. The changes in P45OllE1 was only observed in liver but not in extrahepatic tissues, suggesting a potential role of hepatocyte growth factor in P45OllE1 regulation. In collaboration with Dr. Ravindranath, the presence of P45OllE1 in brain and its induction after chronic ethanol drinking were demonstrated. We also showed that P45OllE1 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C, cAMP dependent protein kinase or calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. ',\n",

The principal focus of these studies is the measurement and correlation of regional cerebral glucose metabolic activity, using positron emission tomography (PET), cerebrospinal fluid metabolites and measures of impulsive aggressive behavior and excessive alcohol consumption. Past studies have correlated decreasing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) with increasing lifetime histories of aggression. We demonstrated that decreased rCMRglu in the orbital- frontal and right temporal regions of the brain is associated with increased lifetime history of aggression. We have also shown differences in orbital-frontal glucose metabolism between men and women; similar gender-related differences in CSF 5-HIAA have been documented. The intent of the present project is to correlate CSF 5-HIAA levels and RCMRGLU in the orbital-frontal and right temporal regions with impulsive aggressive behavior. Subject accrual continues. Scan data comparing alcoholics and normal volunteers is under analysis. When a statistically significant number of research subjects have completed the study, CSF samples will be analyzed in one batch. ',\n",
       " 'Alcohol-induced depletion of polyunsaturated lipids alters the physical and functional properties of biological membranes. Chronic alcohol exposure is known to cause resistance to ethanol-induced membrane disordering measured in vitro. Fluorescence studies in our laboratory confirm that this response recovers 2 to 3 days post-withdrawal in rat liver microsomes. Bulk membrane \"fluidity\" measurements with DPH detect no difference in basal membrane order between controls and liver microsomes from the withdrawal group. However, a localized membrane probe, TMA-DPH, detected a significantly higher basal membrane order in the 24 hours post-withdrawal group. Motions of fluorescent probes localized in specific areas of these bilayers suggest that alcohol-induced changes in lipid composition affect membrane organization in very distinct lipid domains. Furthermore, our laboratory has shown that alcohol depletes the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids such as 20:4n6 and 22:6n3 from membranes. We hypothesize that there is a specialization in the localization and function of the 22:6-phospholipids in biological membranes. To test this hypothesis, the physical environment of 22:6n3 and other polyunsaturated phospholipids have been studied using fluorescence anisotropy and differential scanning calorimetry of membrane preparations. We have found that under defined conditions, bilayers containing 22:6n3 species become more highly packed than bilayers containing species with fewer double bonds. However, correlation times of the same labeled samples indicate that the local environment along the fatty acyl chains becomes increasingly disordered with increasing unsaturation. ',\n",
       " \"During the past year, our research has continued its investigation of central nervous system (CNS) serotonin correlates of low CSF 5-HIAA and tolerance to the intoxicating effects of alcohol. To assess the role of impaired serotonin functioning and intrinsic tolerance on excessive alcohol consumption and the related high levels of aggression, CSF was obtained from alcohol naive rhesus macaque subjects and assayed for CSF 5-HIAA concentrations. Subjects were then dispensed identical doses of IV alcohol and rated for levels of intoxication. Following the ratings for intoxication, subjects' were allowed to consume an alcohol solution. (1) Subjects with lower ratings for intoxication and low CSF 5-HIAA were more likely to consume alcohol to excess. (2) Peer-reared monkeys (monkeys reared without adults, with only age-mates present), were also more likely to consume alcohol to excess. (3) Rates of aggression measured while the subjects were intoxicated were correlated with lifetime rates of severe aggression, suggesting that high rates of aggression during intoxication are an extension of a lifelong pattern of severe aggression, rather than a special form of aggression. (4) As an extension of these findings, interindividual differences in CSF 5-HIAA concentrations were also shown to correlate with time to recover from ketamine anesthesia. (5) Subjects with low CSF 5-HIAA concentrations also showed high serotonin transporter binding, as measured by beta-CIT uptake in SPECT imaging. High beta-CIT uptake was correlated with high rates of aggression and minimal intoxication following a modest dose of alcohol. (6) Studies were initiated that investigated neuroanatomical differences in frontal serotonin functioning in monkeys with low or high CSF 5-HIAA concentrations.

       " 'G protein-coupled receptors are ubiquitous components of signal transduction systems. This project includes an assessment of the role of polyunsaturated phospholipids in modulating G protein-coupled signal transduction and an elucidation of the mechanism of action of ethanol in these systems. In these studies, the visual transduction pathway, a prototypical G protein-coupled system, is being used as a model system. The effect of alcohols, anesthetics, and lipid composition on: the kinetics and extent of formation of metarhodopsin II (MII), the G protein activating form of rhodopsin; MII G protein complex formation; the rate of G protein activation; cGMP phosphodiesterase activation; and the GTPase activity of the G protein are being studied. We have shown that short chain alcohols, such as ethanol, promote MII formation, while longer chain alcohols, such as decanol, are inhibitory. Intermediate length alcohols show a smooth transition from excitatory to inhibitory. The magnitude of the observed effects are dependent on the phospholipid acyl chain composition. The effects of ethanol, acyl chain composition, and cholesterol are well correlated with changes in phospholipid acyl chain packing free volume, as characterized by the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy behavior of the membrane probe, diphenylhexatriene. Our results strongly support a lipid-mediated mechanism of action for alcohols in modulating the activation of a G protein-coupled receptor. Our observations are best explained by a novel lipid packing model developed in this laboratory, in which the presence of polyunsaturated acyl chains, in mixed saturated-unsaturated and dipolyunsaturated acyl chain phospholipids, leads to the formation of lateral domains or clusters in the surface of the membrane. Many published studies demonstrate a requirement for higher than physiological ethanol doses to produce an observable response. We have shown that increasing the osmolality of the sample solution, so as to better simulate cytosolic conditions, increases the efficacy of ethanol, thereby reducing the ethanol requirement to achieve the same response observed in standard buffer solution.

       " 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Olfactory Stimulus Processing D. Hommer Unlike visual or tactile perception, the functional anatomy of odor perception in humans has received very limited attention. This is unfortunate because the brain regions involved in odor perception appear to overlap with the brain regions involved in motivation and emotion. Since, in alcoholics, states of craving for alcohol can be induced by the odor of alcoholic beverages and these states involve both motivational and emotional components, we felt, as a prelude to studies of the functional neuroanatomy of alcohol craving, it would be important to develop techniques to examine brain changes associated with olfactory perception. Normal volunteers were exposed to various odorants using a continuous airflow system, while lying in a standard 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. A pulse sequence developed at the In Vivo NMR Center was used to image blood volume under controlled conditions. This type of scan does not require injection of contrast or labeling agents. For each subject, 24 functional image data sets were acquired, in addition to anatomical images. Each trial consisted of one \"rest state\" scan (odorless air), followed by one \"activated state\" scan (odorant). Three types of odors were used eight times each: pleasant, unpleasant, and alcohol beverage odors. Each scan lasted 20 seconds, during which a three dimensional volume-image of 64 by 64 by 10 voxels was acquired. Significant changes in signal intensity were found almost exclusively in brain structures involved in olfactory processing. Most foci of signal intensity change were located in secondary olfactory areas, such as amygdala, entorhinal cortex, nucleus accumbens septal nuclei, and some in orbital frontal cortex. Different sites of changes were found in different subjects, possibly due to the relatively low sensitivity of this novel brain imaging method. Pleasant and unpleasant odors generally activated different olfactory structures, possibly reflecting the difference in affective evaluation. In addition to functional MRI we are also using 15-0 PET scans during olfactory stimulation in order to compare the distribution of changes in cerebral blood flow measured during PET with the results obtained by fMRI.

       " 'The aim of this project is the development of statistical methods that either take into account interpixel correlation, or apply global image transform methods that permit an analysis of uncorrelated image components. Of typical interest is the investigation of differences between either images from individual subjects acquired under different experimental conditions, or between average images of subjects from different diagnostic groups. Three different statistical methods have been developed, based on the Fourier transform, the wavelet transform, and the theory of Gaussian random fields in the spatial domain. In the Fourier domain, the statistics at different wave numbers are uncorrelated and inference tests can be performed unencumbered by spatial correlations. This method provides for rigorous statistical tests with well-known properties and interpretations, but results in spatially uniform image blurring and may yield relatively poor spatial localization. For the wavelet-transform based analysis, a mathematically rigorous theory has been established that applies parametric statistical tests on wavelet coefficients and results in estimates of local image differences by inverse wavelet transform of only significant coefficients. The method provides for good spatial localization and the implementation of locally adaptive image smoothing, but there has not been much experience accumulated for the interpretation of test outcomes and estimates of image differences. Gaussian random field analysis has good spatial localization properties and permits the investigation of correlations with external variables (e.g., age), but it results in spatially uniform image blurring and does not provide for statistically reconstructed estimates of images differences (either across group or conditions). All three methods have been applied to the analysis of PET and MR images from normal and alcoholic subjects and have identified significant differences in generally the same brain regions. Current research on these topics includes the development of a 1-D Gaussian random field method to analyze fMRI time series data. This methodology can be used to analyze fMRI data acquired from experiments designed to incorporate a long (that is long enough, as determined experimentally, to estimate the variance associated with the acquired data) baseline condition and transition to another activated state such as one produced by drug or alcohol administration. It uses the long baseline data to estimate the variance measure associated with the temporal data from a voxel within the image and sets a statistically rigorous threshold for activation in spite of the known temporal correlation in the data. This analysis technique is being validated with simulated and experimental data. Furthermore, this analysis technique is being incorporated into numerous experiments including one designed to look at the blood flow changes in the brain associated with alcoholic intake in normal subjects. This presents an ideal demonstration of this analysis technique to basically establish a response curve for alcohol intake. Finally, statistical analysis in the temporal domain based on traditional time series analysis in the Fourier domain have been developed and given similar results in terms of localization of the signal in fMRI blood flow studies to other less rigorous and generalizable techniques. This analysis methodology has the potential to (1) localize fMRI activation changes, (2) estimate or reconstruct the activated signal without the associated noise, (3) estimate the hemodynamic response function locally without prior assumptions as to its structure, and (4) detect multiple responses to multiple input stimuli. Currently this technique is being used to study experimental designs including slides of visual stimuli designed to elicit different emotions or alcohol craving.',\n",
       " 'Alcohol consumption produces a variety of pathological effects, including fetal alcohol syndrome, liver and brain damage and an increased risk of certain types of cancers. The association between ethanol consumption and cancer indicates that alcohol intake results in effects on genomic DNA. Mechanisms by which ethanol can produce DNA damage are: 1) direct adduction of DNA by acetaldehyde, the major metabolite of ethanol; 2) the generation of DNA damaging oxygen radicals via by cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), which is induced by ethanol in liver and brain. Our hypothesis is that genotoxicity occurs when the level of ethanol-induced DNA damage overwhelms the capacity of the relevant DNA repair systems. Thus the level of DNA repair activity in cells is a crucial determinant of alcohol-induced DNA toxicity. Ongoing work focuses on a detailed understanding of DNA repair mechanisms in target tissues for ethanol toxicity, in particular, the brain. We have developed the first in vitro assay for the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway in adult brain tissue. NER repairs some types of oxygen radical damage to DNA and is critical for protecting neurons against endogenous oxidative DNA damage. Induction of CYP2E1 by ethanol would also result in increased levels of reactive oxygen species and oxidative DNA damage. This system is being used to better characterize the NER pathway in brain cells. To better understand the role of different DNA repair pathways in addressing ethanol-induced DNA damage, we are examining the effects of ethanol, acetaldehyde and elevated levels of CYP2E1 on cellular toxicity in cell lines and whole animals lacking specific DNA repair pathways. These experiments will determine the relative role of the different DNA repair pathways in protecting cells against different types of ethanol-induced DNA damage. This work may have important implications for human beings with deficiencies in these pathways. Another major focus is on N2-ethyl deoxyguanosine, the major DNA adduct produced by acetaldehyde. This adduct is undetectable in normal liver but accumulates in the DNA of mice fed alcohol. We are assessing whether the adduct is a substrate for DNA repair and what type of repair is involved. We are also assessing the mutagenicity of this adduct in mammalian cells. ',\n",

       " 'The major enzymes involved in ethanol metabolism in mammalian liver are the alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) and the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). ADHs oxidize ethanol into acetaldehyde and ALDH2 catalyzes the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetic acid. Both human ADH and ALDH have been reported to be polymorphic with alleles with different kinetic properties. It was proposed that the individual differences in the response to ethanol consumption may be genetically controlled. The most noted variant that influences alcohol metabolism is Glu487Lys, the \"Oriental Variant\" of ALDH2. The ALDH22 (Lys 487) allele has a relative high frequency among East Asian populations (30% to 50%) and has been extensively studied. The Glu 487 Lys substitution is due to a single nucleotide change (G to A) which resulted in an inactive enzyme under physiological conditions. Clinical studies also indicate that individuals who are either homozygous or heterozygous for the ALDH22 allele have altered acetaldehyde metabolism. Although it has been suggested that ALDH2 allele is a protective allele against the development of alcoholism, many questions remain unanswered. This is mainly due to the difficulty of dissecting the effects of altered A activity and other complicated variables such as the social, cultural and environmental influences on drinking behavior. In addition, the physiological consequences of altered acetaldehyde metabolism in human subjects are unclear. Moreover, it is difficult to obtain tissue samples from human subjects. Therefore, animal models with the same genetic background that can be studied under defined experimental conditions are needed to study the effects of reduced A activity on drinking behavior, the tissue damage resulting from ethanol consumption, and the natural role of ALDH2 under conditions when exogenous alcohol has not been administered. Currently, we have established two independent transgenic mice lines carrying the human ALDH2 (Lys487) allele. A genomic clone coding for the mouse ALDH2 gene was obtained. Two knock-out cassettes for the mouse ALDH2 gene were constructed. These are being introduced into embryonic stem cells to disrupt the mouse ALDH2 gene. ',\n",
       " \"The purpose of the project is to examine measures of heart rate variability (HRV), continuously and noninvasively, in male and female alcoholics admitted for drinking cessation. The project serves to test the hypothesis that measures of HRV might serve to distinguish a priori sub-groups of patients at risk for more severe alcohol withdrawal in the absence of clinically apparent symptomatology. The peripheral manifestations of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) are characterized by rapidly changing autonomic influences. These may vary, minute to minute and hour to hour, depending on the severity and stage of AWS. Consequently, the development of HRV measures, which are relatively insensitive to non-stationarity of signal and could capture relevant data during short periods of measurement, was necessary prior to the protocol implementation. An algorithm, using phase-space decomposition, was developed that characterizes the type of noise exhibited in time-series measures such as inter-beat interval (IBI). In agreement with other workers using different methodologies, it was found that healthy subjects generate IBI time-series with noise characteristics between noise and noise. The algorithm was found to be sensitive, distinguishing between healthy comparison subjects measured in an eyes open or eyes closed paradigm. Relatively short measurement times are required to extract the noise characteristics from the time-series within an acceptable degree of error. Relative insensitivity to non-stationarity of signal was demonstrated. A manuscript outlining this method and its application is in preparation. The methodology was used to retrospectively analyze the IBI from EKG's obtained from 264 subjects performed under eyes-open and eyes-closed paradigm. Subjects were stratified based on demographic parameters and presence absence of alcohol dependence. As this data is analyzed, it will provide additional information on the validity and stability of the method. Noise parameters are being compared and contrasted adjusting for age, gender, years of alcohol use, and psychopathology. The results of this analysis will provide valuable information regarding population-based variances of the noise parameter. These results will be applied to the design of the inpatient phase of the study, which will compare and contrast HRV parameters studied in healthy comparison subjects and alcoholics. IBI will be measured in patients for three consecutive 96-hour periods every 7 days during the course of treatment. Application of the phase-space algorithm to a heart beat window of 250 - 350 beats throughout the periods of measurement will allow the analysis of correlations between the noise characteristics and symptoms of AWS. Coarse-graining spectral analysis (CGSA) methodology will also be utilized to simultaneously evaluate parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system (PNS SNS) indicators. \",\n",
       " 'Certain types of cellular cysteine proteases may play an important role in modulating the activity of G-protein coupled receptors. The activity of this class of enzymes is closely regulated by cytoplasmic and nuclear inhibitors. The interaction of these inhibitors with the target proteases is in part mediated by strong hydrophobic interactions. The effects of ethyl alcohol exposure on cysteine protease activity has been studied in cell culture utilizing a PC12 cell line. Activity of these proteases appears to be strongly affected by alcohol exposure. ',\n",
       " 'Based on our previous research findings, we developed and published a model to understand how biological abnormalities can potentially explain the behaviors and diagnoses exhibited by perpetrators of domestic violence. According to this model, changes in neurotransmitters lead to a heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli, anxiety, and conditioned fear which in turn gives rise to either innate behaviors (e.g., fight, flight, and shut down) or learned fear avoidant behaviors designed to avoid anxiety ( e.g., alcohol consumption, self-injurious acts, and obsessive behaviors). Currently, we are analyzing cerebral spinal fluid metabolite concentrations for various excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters consentrations in alcoholics with and without a history of aggression, and healthy controls. Preliminary analyses show there are no significant group differences for Substance P, CRF, and NPY. There is a group difference in the concentration of glutamate. Brain MRI scans from 115 participants have been processed. Data from these brain scans will be used to determine if there are any structural differences between violent and non-violent alcoholics.',\n",
       " 'During FY97 our work exploring the extent to which thermodynamics and kinetics can describe the control of flux in complex systems including glycolysis (J Biol Chem 1994;269: 25502-14) and its interaction with the tricarboxcyclic acid (TCA) cycle, electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation (FASEB J 1995;9:651-8) continued. Most particularly, these studies concentrated upon the limited extent to which alterations in a so-called \"rate-limiting\" enzyme can alter the overall flux in a metabolic pathway. Rather the control of flux, and with it the control of phenotypic expression, is a result of the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of each component in the system. It follows from such an analysis that the actions of drugs or hormones cannot be understood simply in terms of changes in one or a combination of \"signally pathways.\" An example of how the complex hormonal signally pathways, initiated by binding of insulin to its receptor, may be duplicated by metabolic substrates was developed (Am J Cardiol 1997;80:50A-64A). Substrate overload is, of course, particularly relevant to alcoholism, where much of the toxicity results from the presence of abnormal levels of normal metabolic substrates. In the coming year, the role of substrate depletion in TCA cycle of brain during alcohol withdrawal will be explored with the aim of finding alternative, non-addictive treatments. ',\n",
       " 'The goal of this project is to determine the effects of membrane composition and fatty acids on the function of the GABA(A) receptor, particularly with respect to changes in membrane composition associated with chronic ethanol exposure. The GABA(A) receptor is a ligand-gated ion channels and conducts chloride ions in response to binding the neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). GABA(A) receptors are among the most sensitive neuronal signaling systems to ethanol and play a role in the neural adaptation which underlies ethanol dependence. Changes in GABA(A) receptor function are associated with ethanol tolerance and dependence and these changes may be due to the altered neuronal membrane composition associated with chronic ethanol exposure. Dietary n-3 fatty acid (n-3FA) deficiency impairs normal development and learning, and causes a significant reduction in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n3), which is normally present at high concentrations in the mammalian CNS. GABA(A) receptor function may be mediated in part by DHA through effects on membrane composition or via direct interactions with transmembrane regions of the protein. We examined the consequences of DHA phospholipid depletion resulting from an n-3FA deficient diet on GABA(A) receptor function in rats raised on an n-3 FA deficient diet. The predominant change in brain FA composition for rats fed an n-3 FA deficient diet was a 60% depletion of brain DHA compared to controls. Purified rat brain synaptosomes were microtransplanted into Xenopus oocytes for electrophysiological assessment of GABAergic function. This technique yielded surface expression of functional GABA(A) recptors that elicited current in response to GABA. This current could be inhibited by the competitive antagonist SR-95531 and potentiated by the benzodiazepine flurazepam. The GABA EC50 for oocytes injected with adult female n-3 FA deficient rat brain synaptosomes was significantly increased compared to controls (280 and 100 microM, respectively). Maximum current elicited by GABA was also increased in these oocytes compared to controls (60 and 35nA, respectively). These results suggest that GABAergic function is sensitive to the presence of DHA-containing phospholipids in the synaptic plasma membrane. Neuronal membranes are abundant in polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs), particularly the n-3 FA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n3) and the n-6 FA arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n6). AA and or DHA influence the function of several important neuronal transmembrane proteins such as G-protein coupled receptors and some voltage-gated ion channels. We determined the effect of direct application of PUFAs on the function of the inhibitory LGICs, the alpha1,beta2,gamma 2 GABA(A) receptor and the alpha1 homomeric glycine receptor. These receptors are pentameric transmembrane proteins with a total of twenty transmembrane regions, thus it is likely that membrane components play important roles in modulating their function. Receptors were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and two-electrode voltage clamp was used to measure neurotransmitter concentration response curves in the absence and presence of the free FAs DHA, AA, docosapentanoic acid (DPAn6, 22:5n6), DPAn-3 (22:5n3) and oleic acid (OA, 18:1n9) (10 microM). OA, DPAn3 and DPAn6 had no effect on the function of either receptor, demonstrating that effects of the other FAs are not simply due to the prescence of a hydrophobic compound. For the GABA(A) receptor the maximum current was decreased by more than 50% by DHA (22:6n3), AA (20:4n6) and EPA (20:5n3), but OA (18:1n9), DPAn-6 (22:5n6) and DPAn-3 had no effect. The same pattern of effect was observed for inhibition of the GABA EC50. For the glycine receptor only AA and EPA reduced the maximum current by more than 25%, while all 5 PUFAs reduced the EC50 for glycine. The reduction in EC50 values indicates that the effective PUFAs enhance ligand-receptor interactions, while the reduced maximum currents indicate a reduced efficiency of the channel gating processes.',\n",
       " ': Metabolic control analysis is the formal application of kinetics and thermodynamics to determine the extent to which the control of flux through a metabolic pathway is determined by a particular enzymatic step in that pathway. Reviews of the central energy producing pathway, the citric acid cycle, and of mitochondrial bioenergetics have been published. What is found by performing a formal metabolic control analysis is that, in contrast to the widely held view that there is a \\'rate controlling step\\', control of flux in a pathway is distributed across many enzymatic steps in a pathway and varies depending upon conditions. It is this change in flux in a metabolic pathway which often defines the phenotype of a disease process. Further, these insights suggest that a drug or gene therapy directed at a single enzymatic step may not correct a disease phenotype, but rather a number of steps in a single or in several linked pathways would have to be altered in a disease phenotype. This lead to an investigation of several degenerative neurological and cardiac diseases which might be treated by alteration of the substrate provided, among them were Alzheimer\\'s and Parkinson\\'s disease, type I and II diabetes and heart failure. The possibility of treating Parkinson\\'s disease with mild ketosis has been strengthened by subsequent work in outside laboratories where MPTP induced death in hippocampal neurons in C57 black mice was reduced by Na D-R-hydroxybutyrate. Feeding a hyperketogenic diet to a small group of Parkinsonian patients resulted in an approximately 60% reduction of symptoms in a preliminary trail. These concepts were discussed in two meetings sponsored by the NIH Office of Rare Diseases and the disease phenotype targets more fully outlined. Among the fatal diseases for which there is no current effective therapy is Duchenne\\'s muscular dystrophy affecting 1 3000 male births in the United States. Work done in this laboratory and in the laboratory of Professor Kieran Clarke in Oxford have found that lack of dystrophin in the MDX mouse, the rodent analogue of Duchenne\\'s, results in a failure of insulin to induce translocation the insulin responsive GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. As such, these patients fall into the disease phenotype potentially treatable by ketosis. We have been examining the degree to which mild ketosis can improve the hydraulic efficiency of the isolated working perfused MDX mouse heart, a technically difficult preparation which is unique to this laboratory. This material has been the subject of 2 meetings sponsored by the NIH Office of Rare Disease over the past 2 years. More recently, we have examined the effects of the use of ketone bodies on altering the survival of hippocampal neurons exposed to hypoxia in culture. We found that acute cell death in hippocampal cells could be prevented during 2 hours of hypoxia and that apoptotic cell death could also be decreased for a long period of time. This raises the possibility of the use of ketones in the treatment of acute stroke or cerebral hemorrhage or in the treatment of traumatic brain injury. We currently are scheduled to develop oral preparations of D-R-hydroxybutyrate for use in military applications. There is no provision in this project for the use of these materials in disease states. It is hoped that various relevant institutes within the NIH may wish to consider the use of these materials in clinical trials of human subjects. Of particular relevance here would be the possible treatment of Parkinson\\'s disease in the light of the recent publications from other labs following our work in this area. Likewise the possible treatment of Duchenne\\'s muscular dystrophy should be considered in view of the absence of any currently effective therapy. Significance to the Programs of this Institute The research reported in this section, by applying a rigorous metabolic control analysis, allows the definition of disease phenotypes which may be amenable to new therapeutic approaches in a variety of common and rare diseases, which share a common pathophysiological basis. This approach defines a new way of approaching therapy which aims at changing interlinked and interdependent metabolic pathways rather that attempting to define one key \"rate limiting step\" as causative in a disease state.',\n",
       " 'Chronic excessive alcohol consumption depletes brain stores of omega-3 fatty acids which are necessary for optimal neural function. In our ongoing clinical trial of aggressive alcoholics, we determine if treatment with 2.8 g d of omega-3 fatty acids will reduce 1) aggressive behaviors, 2) improve neurochemical measures of serotonergic function as well as other neurotransmitters associate with impulsivity and alcohol use 3) reduce measures of craving 4) reduce risk of relapse. This protocol is active and has enrolled 96 subjects with 100% tracking of data. Preliminary results indicate that anger is reduced by 33% (p<0.0008) in 12 weeks and a trend towards reduction in number of relapse days (55%, p= ns). Pilot analyses also suggest a substantial reduction in craving measures. Greater omega-3 fattty acid plasma status on admission correlated with less brain atrophy indicating that these fatty may protect from alcohol induced brain atrophy. The study has completed enrollemnt and is under analysis. These findings complement a placebo controlled clinical trial conducted with collaboration with Laure-Budens Branchey, M.D., among polysubstance dependent subjects where omega-3 fatty acids reduced anger scores by 50% over 4 months. In a collaborative trial among subjects admitted to an emergency room with deliberate self harm, we found that 2 g d of omega-3 fatty acids reduced future suicidal thinking, anger and depression scores while improving positive outlooks to life. Extending these findings to normative populations, we found that lower plasma levels of omega-3 fatty acids correlated with greater neuroticism and less agreeableness among healthy controls. In an observational trial conduced with Dr. Muldoon at the University of Pittsburgh. These data indicate that deficiencies impair affect in otherwise normal populations. Mothers can become depleted of omega-3 essential fatty acids during pregnancy when their dietary intake is inadequate. Dietary deficiencies may increase the risk of depressive symptoms for the mothers. Preliminary data is available from an open trial of omega-3 fatty acids among women with depression during pregnancy currently being conducted in collaboration with Marlene Freeman, MD at the University of Arizona. Depressive symptoms were reduced an average of 43.5 % during 8 weeks of treatment. These findings are significant as they offer a treatment for depression during pregnancy that is not only non-toxic, but has additional health benefits to pregnant women and their babies. These findings are being followed up with a randomized, controlled trial which has enrolled n=60 subjects. The results of these interventional trials were predicted from data from an epidemiological study of the dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy among nearly 14,500 women enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Findings were robust after rigorous examination of potential confounding factors. In a major publication we found that the 2004 FDA and EPA advisory for women to limit seafood consumption during pregnancy inadvertently creates neurodevelopmental harm to the children. The children of mothers who ate seafood below the limit advised had greater risks of peer problems, poor prosocial behaviors and low verbal IQ and poorer performance on British nationally administered standardized academic tests. The work was conducted in collaboration with the ALSPAC study and examined nearly 9,000 children. These data can be evaluated to determine if inadequate intake during pregnancy or early childhood is a risk factor for future substance abuse. We have collaborated with Marc Schuckit, M.D and Jean Golding, Ph.D. in designing a study to prospectively capture initial drinking behavior of these children as they enter adolescence. If this is identified as a risk factor, prevention studies can be planned. Dietary intakes that meet criteria for Recommended Daily Intakes (RDAs) have been calculated from two spopurces of data: cross-national data sets and the ALSPAC cohort study. Dose response relationships were derived comparing greater intake of seafood and lower prevalence rates of four psychiatric disorders and lower mortality rates of eight major causes. In order to further refine this finding we utilized the observation that the omega-6 fatty acids from seed oils compete for inclusion in tissues with omega-3 fatty acids, which are rich in seafood. The amount of omega-3 fatty acids required to reduce risk of illness can be reduced 10-fold by consuming fewer omega-6 fatty acids from seed oils.',\n",
       " \"Alcoholism is frequently associated with aggressive behaviors and dietary changes or deficiencies. It has been shown that there is a strong association between alcohol consumption and the violent behaviors exhibited by perpetrators of domestic violence. However, the actual mechanism(s) by which alcohol induces aggressive behavior is poorly understood. Currently we are conducting a study to determine if treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor can reduce aggression in individuals characterized by frequent episodes of domestic violence. To date, 42 subjects have been enrolled in the study. Functional MRI (fMRI) is being used to assertain if there are significant differences between perpetrators, non-violent alcoholics, and healthy controls when participants interpret threatening and non-threatening stiumli. The fMRI is repeated after perpetrators have been on placebo or fluoxetine for three months. Participants' aggression will be examined in relation to: fMRI results, drug effect, and genotype of the serotonin transporter. Results from MRI imaging are also being analyzed to determine if perpetrators of domestic violence have differences in brain structures associated with fear conditioning and fear avoidance. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) an essential omega-3 fatty acid that is selectively concentrated in the brain. Because DHA is a potentially important factor in the etiology of violence and hostility, we have analyzed cerbrospinal fluid and plasma samples from perpetrators of domestic violence. Currently, we have a manuscript in press showing that low plasma DHA levels were correlated to higher cerebrospinal fluid corticotropin releasing hormone levels in perpetrators of domestic violence. A second manuscript has been submitted for publication showing that red blood cell folate levels were significantly correlated with plasma DHA. In a recent publication, we showed that in healthy controls peripheral blood glucose concentrations are significantly correlated with the CSF concentrations of the dopamine metabolite, HVA and the noradrenaline metabolite, MHPG. These correlations may represent a homeostatic relationship between brain neurotransmitter activity and blood glucose.\",\n",
       " 'It is our hypothesis that alcohol abuse leads to the depletion of polyunsaturated lipids from many tissues. Such changes in the liver and brain as well as in other organs and tissues may cause or contribute to the pathological changes associated with alcoholism. Previously, we have shown that there are losses in arachidonic acid (20:4n6) and other n-6 fatty acids in alcohol exposed rat tissues as well as in the blood cells of alcoholics. Animals fed borage oil rich in 18:3n6 during the ethanol inhalation period (7 d), did not have as great a loss in 20:4n6 as those fed 18:1n9 or long chain n-3 fatty acid-based diets and these losses were traced mainly to the phospholipid and cholesterol ester pools. Similarly, losses in n-3 fatty acids subsequent to alcohol exposure were not as great in animals fed a menhaden oil-based diet. The rodent model of alcoholism has been improved with the use of 12 hr per day of inhalation rather than continuous exposure, a longer duration of exposure and the control of the diets, particularly with low essential fat formulation. Human studies have shown that our species are capable of a complete spectrum of essential fatty acid metabolism and that polyunsaturates in the diet regulate the activity of this pathway. ',\n",
       " 'The essential fatty acids (EFA), linoleate (18:2n6) and linolenate (18:3n3), are desaturated and elongated to arachidonate (20:4n6) and docosahexaenoate (22:6n3), respectively. A stable isotope gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method is being used to examine these processes in vivo. Studies in mice, rats, cats, rhesus monkeys and humans have suggested that all mammals have elongation and desaturation capability and that their products may be monitored in the blood. In general, ethanol consumption lowers the levels of 20:4n6 and 22:6n3 in the blood cells and livers of animals. We have shown that the mechanisms underlying the disruption of the essential fatty acid levels in these tissues are, in part, due to the inhibition of the elongation desaturation of 18-carbon essential fatty acids by alcohol. A study in felines given alcohol for six months showed marked reductions of 20:4n6 and 22:6n3 in the liver and blood compared to controls. In the brain and retina the levels of 22:6n3 decreased, however, 20:4n6 levels remained unchanged. In a rhesus monkey study where the diet contained low but adequate amounts of essential fatty acids and minimal levels of antioxidants, 12 months of alcohol exposure led to sharp declines in the level of 22L6n3 in the liver and plasma. The level of 20:4n6 in the plasma also decreased by about 50%. The levels of 22:6n3 in the brain and retina of an alcohol exposed monkey were much lower relative to chow-fed animals. It is suggested, therefore, that chronic alcohol exposure causes an EFA deficiency in animals which leads to lower amounts of 22:6n3 in the nervous system. A related study in felines indicated that the maintenance of neural long chain polyunsaturates is necessary for the proper development of retinal function. ',\n",
       " 'During the past year, our research has included studies of: (1) Etiological mechanisms underlying individual differences in alcohol consumption including the effects of age, alcohol exposure, setting, sex, and paternal genetic contributions; (2) The effect of early experience on the development of the nervous system and on the acquisition of social competence and aggressive behaviors; (3) The relationship between serotonin (SHT) and aggression in laboratory and free-ranging rhesus macaques. To obtain a subject pool of aggressive rhesus macaques, we continued to investigate free-ranging adolescent males drawn from a subject pool of 4500 free-ranging rhesus macaques; (4) Developmental patterns of rhesus macaques selectively bred for extremes in CSF 5-HIAA.

       " 'The goal is to use genes determining genetic variants of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and evoked responses of the EEG and to identify vulnerability genes for alcoholism and related behaviors with genetic components. This initiative is being pursued by: 1) family transmission and association studies on families identified by a population-based survey for probands with EEG variants. 2) a genetic linkage study to map the genes determining the variants. In the genetic epidemiological study, the low voltage alpha (LVA), EEG variant was confirmed to be transmitted in autosomal dominant fashion at least in some families. Alcoholism and anxiety disorders were more frequent in individuals with the LVA trait, identifying a more homogeneous subgroup of alcoholics with a genetic vulnerability. Families with the LVA variant and alcoholism have been collected and families are being analyzed for genetic linkage to dispersed and candidate gene DNA and protein markers. ',\n",
       " \"The problem of alcoholism in American Indians has been comprehensively addressed in three family linkage datasets: 1] SW tribe; 2] Eastern Oklahoma tribe with low prevalence of alcoholism; 3] Plains Indian tribe with neuropsychological data [EEG] - analytical studies in progress; and also in a large cross-population study - the Ten Tribes Study which systematically compares 1800 randomly sampled subjects from seven tribes. In addition, LNG is the genetics collaborating laboratory on the first pharmacogenetic study on alcoholism treatment response [to naltrexone and sertraline]. This study, on Alaska Natives, is led by S. O'Malley [Yale]. We are assessing genetic linkage to alcoholism and associated psychiatric disorders in a Southeastern Oklahoma Indian tribe with over 30,000 enrolled members living within tribal boundaries in Oklahoma. Psychiatric assessment was with the SSAGA semi-structured interview. By contrast to neighboring American Indian tribes that have high prevalences of alcoholism, this tribe stands out because alcoholism has a low prevalence, about 1% and 10% of females and males, respectively. By studying American Indians in the context of low alcoholism, we can expect to reveal differences in the roles of genetic and or environmental determinants of alcoholism. Genetic analysis is being conducted using two samples from the tribe: a small random sample (N=100) and large extended families (N=200 tested subjects). The sampling design accommodates case-control association analyses and non-parametric two- and multi-point linkage methods. In order to perform the analyses outlined above, individual psychiatric interviews and blood samples have been collected. Research diagnoses are made from the psychiatric interviews and DNA for genotyping is being extracted from the blood samples. We are also examining individual differences in cultural experience and how they relate to vulnerability to alcohol related problems. This year we have begun collection of EEG, ERP and heart rate variability data on the individuals we previously interviewed. This project includes population genetics analysis of numbers of alleles, allele frequencies, and haplotype differences among American Indian tribes. This includes studies focused on genes involved in behavior [e.g. COMT] and gene cluster regions [e.g. chr 5 GABAA cluster]. This information is important to genetic linkage and disease association studies on American Indians because failure to account for population diversity can result in false evidence for linkage, and allelic heterogeneity among groups can create spurious associations with disease. The genetic systems being typed are the same as those being used currently in our genetic linkage analyses. We are also able to study comparison populations, including Asians. Some of this work is being carried out in collaboration with Kenneth Kidd, at Yale. Various tests for allele frequency differences between tribal groupings based on cultural and linguistic affinities are being performed. In order to more fully quantify isolate structure, and exploit such populations for linkage analyses, we have developed a maximum likelihood method to characterize populations by their levels of gene identity. We have applied this method to microsatellite typings for three American Indian and three European populations. Low gene identity was observed in Europeans, approximately 28%. By contrast, gene identity was higher in all American Indian populations, about 39%. We have studied local patterns of gene diversity in 7 samples from populations in the Southwest and Alaska. These populations all speak closely related Athabascan languages, despite their dispersed geographic locations. When compared to non-Athabascan speaking neighbors, we do not find a strong tendency for these populations to comprise a unified gene pool. Rather, geographic proximity is the best predictor of the genetic relationship. In AAmerican Indians, reduced haplotype diversity was observed at several loci, including DRD2 and ADH. Large differences in the frequencies of several functional alleles as compared to Caucasian populations were detected. These include DRD2 Ser311Cys, COMT Val158Met, and HTTLPR. The whole genome scan for the SW tribe detected two potential new loci for alcoholism: the DRD4 region at the chromosome 11p telomere, and the region of the GABAA cluster near the chromosome 4p centromere. The SW Indian sample is a large family (N=582) comprising a sizeable fraction of a Southwestern tribe with a high rate of alcoholism (85% of males, greater than 50% of females). This family was systematically interviewed, substantial evidence for familial transmission of alcoholism was found, and then it was evaluated for genetic linkage in collaboration with investigators from NIDDK and, using a large (N=517) panel of DNA markers that covered the genome. A linkage hotspot in the GABA receptor clustervregion on Chrc4 was followed up with high density mapping, revealing an LD signal at the GABA alpha 2 gene. This is in line with results from investigators at the University of Connecticut and the University of Indiana. A similar whole-genome scan is underway in the Plains Indian tribe, where EEG intermediate phenotypes were also collected. Candidate gene linkage findings include two that are anxiety-related: serotonin transporter anxiety and a sex-specific association of COMT Val158Met to anxiety. The HTR1B gene appears to be linked to antisocial alcoholism. The SW tribe studies were informative for the meaning and consequences of alcohol-related diagnoses in American Indians. The results are representative because 1] the very large family was ascertained solely on the basis of structure and availability, 2] the family is representative of the tribe in coefficient of relationship and demography, and 3] CAGE scores do not differ from a random sample of 3112 individuals studied collaboratively by NIDDK [Hanson et al]. The evidence from the SW tribe is that binge drinking is neither benign nor beneficial, that alcoholism is familial, and that the same patterns of psychiatric comorbidity seen in the general U.S. population [National Comorbidity Survey] are seen in Indian alcoholics. Almost all of the large fraction of the population who were binge drinkers were also alcoholics, and binge drinkers tended to become alcoholic at a younger age. Regardless of whether binge drinkers met criteria for alcoholism, they were dramatically worse off in each of the four symptom categories evaluated in the SADS-L: social, work, violence lawlessness and physical. We found the same heavy clusterings of psychiatric disorders with alcoholism as previously observed in the general population of the U.S. These results may help lay to rest the misconception that drinking, particularly binge drinking, is other than deleterious to American Indians and regardless of whether binge drinking is culturally determined or congruent. Finally, stress trauma -common in these communities and often a consequence of alcoholism and heavy alcohol use, was shown to be critically important risk element in the development of alcoholism and other psychiatric disorders. These findings, which we reported from the SW Indian tribe, have now been verified in the Ten Tribes dataset, and a large-scale gene-environment interaction study is underway using two functional polymorphisms: COMT Val158Met and HTTLPR, which alter stress and anxiety responses.\",\n",
       " 'The principal objective of this study is to elucidate metabolic functions of polyunsaturated fatty acids and phospholipids in nervous tissues with particular reference to their modulation by ethanol. Our studies focused on the oxygenation, release, incorporation and remodeling of the major polyunsaturates in the brain, docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n3) and arachidonic acid (20:4n6). We found that the major free fatty acid in brain was 20:4n6 and that chronic ethanol exposure increased the free 20:4n6 level in he brain considerably. Endogenous PLA2 activity, which hydrolyzed 20:4n6 preferentially, was found in the brain mitochondria and synaptosomes. On the contrary, cobra venom PLA2 hydrolyzed 22:6n3 faster than 20:4n6 in vitro from mixed liposomes or synaptosome preparations. We did not find any selective reincorporation of these fatty acids into synaptosomal lipids, indicating that the substrate specificity of the cobra venom PLA2 is different from that of the rat brain PLA2. In continuation of the study on characterization of pineal lipoxygenation, we found that 18 carbon fatty acids were also well-metabolized by the rat pineal primarily to 13-hydroxy derivatives. Platelets metabolized both substrates to 13- and 9-hydroxy compounds and leukocytes metabolized 18:2n6 to both 9- and 13-, and 18:3n3 to 9-, 12-, 13- and 16-hydroxy derivatives, respectively. These results indicated that the property of 15-LO in pineal differs from that of leukocytes or platelets. In order to understand the enrichment process of the major polyunsaturated fatty acids in brain, incorporation of 20:6n3 and 20:4n6 from diet underwent the chain shortening and elongation processes before incorporation into the brain. This oxidation was especially active for 22:6n3 and during the first week after birth. ',\n",
       " \"Consumption of ethanol (Et) alters certain regulatory aspects of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA). Because the integrity of this system depends on the coordinated synthesis and secretion of specific regulatory substances at the hypothalamic [(e.g., corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH); vasopressin (AVP); biogenic amines)], pituitary-gland [(e.g., beta endorphin (BE); ACTH)] and adrenal gland (e.g., catecholamines; glucocorticoids) level, we have been evaluating the impact of Et at each level of the HPAA. Activation of the HPAA or hypercortisolism accompanies both short- and long-term consumption of Et and the Et withdrawal syndrome. Alcoholics often present with a pseudo- Cushing's syndrome in which some 17-40% of alcoholics do not respond to the dexamethasone suppression test during the first week of abstinence. Since a relative state of elevated glucocorticoids (chronic continuous or chronic intermittent) can lead to neural changes and even cell death, particularly in the hippocampus, the progressive loss of cognitive capacity in many alcoholics may indeed be due in part to hypercortisolemia and subsequent irreversible neural damage in the hippocampus and other areas of the central nervous system. Furthermore, armed with the concept of the bidirectional communication between the HPAA and the immune system. We are exploring whether or not certain immune system-derived cytokines may be ameliorating or accelerating neural death through endocrine or paracrine actions. Certainly cytokines stimulate diverse cell types in an attempt to repair cellular damage through intracellular signal amplification which could in concert with Et and glucocorticoids overstimulate selected neural populations leading to their demise. \",\n",
       " 'Studies on individuals and animals with genetic defects in serotonin function can shed light on the role of this neurotransmitter in behavior and on the role of milder functional variants in serotonin genes in predisposing individuals to psychopathologies and to alcoholism. We are identifying probands for family studies who have several behavioral disorders and by measuring the serotonin metabolite 5HIAA in cerebrospinal fluid. Probands and family members receive detailed neurologic and psychiatric assessment and familial transmission and comorbidity is concurrently assessed. Subjects with aberrant serotonin function and their families will be the focus for genetic linkage analyses using dispersed probes and direct studies (for example, sequencing) of candidate genes such as tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). We are also studying animal behavioral genetic models in which serotonin function may be perturbed. A TPH polymorphism was found to be associated with low CSF 5HIAA and suicidality in impulsive alcoholic Finns. Coding sequence polymorphisms of 5HTIA, 5HTIDalpha and 5HTIDbeta were identified by SSCP analysis. In mice, TPH was identified as a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for sleep time following ethanol injection. ',\n",
       " 'Dysfunctions in serotonergic pathways may underlie several psychiatric disorders. The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) plays a critical role in the termination of serotonergic neurotransmission by Na-dependent uptake of serotonin by the presynaptic neuron. 5-HTT also represents the initial site of action of certain antidepressant drugs and neurotoxins. A functionally significant polymorphism in the 5-HTT promoter was identified (5HTTLPR). The polymorphism affects 5-HTT transcription and, ultimately, 5-HTT function. Frequency of the 5-HTTLPR was determined in a variety of clinical psychiatric populations including alcoholics; linkage and association studies were performed. Positive linkage was detected between 5-HTTLPR and the two anxiety-related personality traits available on the TPQ, at least partially replicating the reported association of this variant to behavior (see bibliography). In contrast, no association was found in Italian patients with obsessive compulsive disorders, panic disorders and eating disorders. However, two additional disease-specific findings were made: 1) in a collaboration with A. Malhotra and D. Pickar, 5-HTTLPR was found to be significantly associated with BPRS-rated psychoticism in schizophrenia and 2) in a collaboration with N. Rosenthal, HTTLPR was significantly linked with seasonal affective disorder and seasonality rating in SAD patients. ',\n",
       " 'Nonhuman primate behavioral models offer a unique opportunity for understanding the role of gene x environment interactions in behavior. Higley and colleagues [LCS] are the principal collaborators. They have collected dense neurochemical and behavioral data on animals raised by their mothers, cross-fostered and peer reared. We have established over 200 fibroblast cell lines and assisted with collections of DNA from the Poolesville and Morgan Island colonies. Heritability of aspects of macaque behavior [e.g aggression, alcohol consumption] and neurochemistry [e,g. CSF 5HIAA levels] were established. They detected effects of rearing environment on alcohol consumption and demonstrated interaction with serotonin transporter and MAOA genotype. Drs. Newman and Barr from the Higley lab work directly in LNG towards the studies on the relationship of candidate genes to behavior. We have detected both interspecific and intraspecific sequence variations in HTR1A in macaques and other nonhuman primates. HTR1A is the intronless coding locus (1266 base pair - 422 amino acids) for a 5HT1A, a G protein-coupled serotonin receptor which serves as the autoreceptor on serotonin nerve terminals. Previous work in this laboratory discovered two variants (Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1995;210(2):530-6), characterized their frequency and distribution in human populations (Human Mutation 1996;7:135-43) and investigated their functional effects (Neuropsychopharmacology 1997; 17:18-26). In order to assess the polymorphic spectrum of this locus in a primate animal model heavily used in neuroscience research, we cloned and sequenced the highly conserved 5HT1A gene from four macaque species (Macaca fascicularis , Macaca maura, Macaca mulatta and Macaca nemestrina) and from the vervet monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops). The interspecific variation supports the known phylogeny of Macaca. The relationships of these sequence variants to behavior is being studied. An STR panel was developed by T. Newman to determine paternity relationships in macaques. In addition to HTR1A, several other neurogenetic candidate genes [e.g. COMT, DAT,CRH] are being sequenced and studied in parallel fashion in various primate species. Remarkably, functional polymorphisms similar to the human MAOA and HTTLPR loci are found in the macaque. and these are being followed for linkage to behavior, including G x E interactions. The macaque HTTLPR variant was shown to predispose to increased alcohol consumption only in the context of early life stress.',\n",
       " 'Sequence variation in genes within the non-pseudoautosomal region of the Y chromosome within and between Hominidae and other species can elucidate Y chromosome evolution and paternal population history and can help make sense of phenotypic variation in the male. A Y chromosome haplotype was associated with antisocial alcoholism in Finns. Y chromosome haplotypes indicated that the Finnish population- frequently used as a semi-isolated population in genetic studies- has a dual Northern European and Asian origin. Further, it has undergone a male-specific population bottleneck. The sequence of the coding region of the RPS4Y locus, a ribosomal protein gene, was determined in 4 non-human primate species and in 59 individuals from three human populations. Sequence analysis of RPS4Y in the Hominidae suggests that the RPS4Y protein is under relaxed functional selection compared to its highly conserved homolog, RPS4X, and predicts that the gene transposed to the Y chromosome approximately at the prosimian-simian divergence. Sequence variation at RPS4Y was detected both within and between human populations. One RPS4Y variant, C711T, appears to be the first common coding sequence polymorphism on the Y chromosome. The coalescence of human sequences (175,000 + - 125,000 years) at this locus is similar to estimates derived from different Y loci and different human population samples. The ethnographic distribution of this Y chromosome substitution identifies a paternal lineage ancestral to Asian and Native American populations. Other genes in the non-pseudoautosomal region of the Y chromosome are being evaluated for variation, informativeness for evolutionary history of the Y chromosome and relationship to behavior.',\n",
       " 'In order to follow-up a linkage finding on chromosome 11p15.5 to alcohol dependence (Long et al., submitted), two short tandem-repeat marker panels for semi-automated fluorescent genotyping containing 15 loci distributed over the distal 20 cM of chromosome 11p15.5 have been created. One panel (six loci) has been typed in approximately 500 psychiatrically-interviewed individuals from a Southwest American Indian tribe. A second panel (nine loci) has been optimized and typing will begin soon. In addition, two coding polymorphisms and one promoter polymorphism at DRD4, a candidate gene for involvement in vulnerability to alcohol dependence, have been typed in order to develop haplotypes at this locus, distal to the short-tandem repeat locus linked in the whole genome linkage scan. Haplotype construction, sib-pair linkage analysis and map construction will be performed to confirm the primary linkage finding and define intervals of maximum linkage to alcohol dependence. ',\n",

       " 'The mu opioid receptor is implicated in the reward, tolerance and withdrawal effects of alcohol and other drugs of abuse. We directly sequenced the human mu opioid receptor locus, OPRM1, to detect natural variation that might affect the function of this receptor or be associated with psychiatric phenotypes related to opioid function. Four DNA sequence variants were found: three amino acid substitutions (Ala6Val [rare], Asn40Asp [frequency 10%], Ser147Cys [rare]) and one intronic variant (IVS2+691G C [frequency 50%]). OPRM1 alleles, genotypes and haplotypes from three psychiatrically characterized population samples (N = 791) were used to perform association and sib-pair linkage analyses to alcohol dependence. There was no significant association or linkage between OPRM1 and alcohol dependence in any of the three population samples. These results and power calculations strongly suggest that variation at the mu opioid receptor is not involved in vulnerability to DSM-III-R Alcohol Dependence. Variation at this gene could be investigated for possible association to response to opiate pharmacotherapy and to variation in opioid function, that is, pain or nociception and the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary function.

       " 'Genetic variations in the enzymes involved in serotonin metabolism may contribute to a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, from eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and alcoholism to autism. Tryptophan, obtained only from the diet in humans, is converted to serotonin by tryptophan hydroxylase, or to kynurenine by tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2). Both enzymes are rate limiting in their respective pathways. The purpose of this study is to screen the TD02 gene for polymorphisms, assess functionality, and search for disease associations. The original research method was single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Most of the coding region (11 of the 12 exons), the intronic sequence and the promoter region was successfully amplified and screened across populations with alcoholism, impulsivity, anorexia or bulimia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, major depression and suicidality, and subjects enrolled in a tryptophan depletion study. No associations were found for polymorphisms in introns 5, 6 or 11 nor for a variant in exon 7 (A to C, 749 Asn to His). In the SSCP screening of the promoter region no polymorphisms were found in the regions of two TATA boxes. Two variants have been detected in the putative promoter glucocorticoid response elements. The promoter, coding region and introns have been screened by Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC) to look for further polymorphisms and confirm those already found. 5 exonuclease assays have been developed for 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the coding region of the gene and for 2 SNPs and one GTT insertion in the promoter region. These 17 polymorphisms have now been genotyped in 4 populations; 673 Finnish Caucasians, 220 US Caucasians, 337 Plains American Indians and 280 African Americans. Haplotype blocks have been identified and haplotype-based association studies for alcoholism are underway.',\n",
       " \"HIGH THROUGHPUT SNP IDENTIFICATION. LNG has discovered over 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in more than 50 neuro-genetic candidate genes for addictive behaviors, including alcoholism. Approximately 20% of the SNPs discovered by LNG result in non-synonymous amino acid changes that may alter function of the encoded protein or alterations in expression of the gene. The implications of detected sequence variation have been profound: for example a rare serotonin transporter variant we found was shown to be functional and discovered to lead to severe pathology: Asperger's syndrome, treatment resistant OCD, and anorexia nervosa, in two families in which it is segregating, and a third common allele of the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (HTTLPR) which leads to altered function and enabled detection of linkage of the gain-of-function LA allele to OCD in two populations. For example, the common HTR2C Ser23Cys and HTR2A Asn452His alleles have been shown to be functional and linked to the clozapine responsiveness of schizophrenics. Genes for SNP screening were selected on the basis of postulated roles in alcohol, treatment response, identification in whole genome or candidate linkage or association study, and the availability of genomic sequence data. Because a goal of the project is to determine the role of SNPs in complex genetic disorders, we focused our screening in efforts on protein coding portions of the candidate gene and possible regulatory regions within and flanking the protein coding regions. We used a DNA panel composed of 477 genomic DNAs enriched for clinical and ethnic diversity. HIGH THROUGHPUT GENOTYPING. Central issues in high throughput genotyping procedures are accuracy, flexibility, and cost. Because of its assay design flexibility, low error rate, and potential for performing 96 to 384 assays simultaneously, we have used some 1,000 individual 5' exonuclease assays. We also use SNPlex, a DNA ligation method, in which pools of 48 SNPs are simultaneously genotyped, with detection on an ABI capillary sequencer and DNA preparation using robotics. Regarding array-based genotyping, we have created a 1536 SNP Addictions Array. This array enables haplotype-based and candidate locus coverage of some 122 genes, including genes important in the domains of alcohol metabolism, stress anxiety, monoamine function, and signaling. The array also includes 200 genomic control loci for detecting, and correcting, ethnic stratification in case control studies. Use of the Addictions Array by Extramural investigators will be facilitated.\",\n",
       " 'Candidate allele & gene hypotheses developed from pharmacological & genetic findings are tested. Also, we follow up on whole genome linkage findings. Candidate gene linkage investigations included: DRD2 Ser311Cys and haplotype alcoholism and opioid addiction, HTR1B antisocial alcoholism, SLCA4 anxiety, SLCA4 OCD, HTT and severe serotonin-associated behaviors, BDNF Val66Met and episodic memory, NPY anxiety, & COMT opioid addiction Schizophrenia anxiety dysphoria Executive cognition, TPH2 anxiety-dysphoria, GABAA alpha 2 and alpha 6 alcoholism, and DISC1 schizophrenia. Phenotype, sampling framework, genetic structures [e.g. TDT, sibpairs], & power are evaluated. Assessment is generally by structured interview, & usually with intermediate phenotypes and or additional end-phenotypes. The Finnish dataset was ascertained from criminal alcoholic probands & is thus enriched for Type II [early onset] alcoholism. SW Indian, Plains Indian, Ten Tribes, & Finnish datasets are derived from isolates; psychiatric interviewed controls are available from source populations. Chinese and German case control datasets are in use as is a predominantly African American cocaine dataset [N=1000]. Remaining datasets are almost entirely Caucasian. Some 980 psychiatrically interviewed Caucasian population controls are available. The SW Indian dataset includes 600 sibpairs, the Finnish dataset used in the SLCA4 study included 366 sibpairs, & the Plains Indian EEG dataset contains a large number of sib & relative pairs. Both schizophrenia datasets [Egan & Weinberger, Malhotra] enable TDT sTDT analysis. A publicly available portion of the COGA datset (Collaboration on the Genetics of Alcoholism) is also used. Power for case control association is dependent on allele frequency, association strength, & desired level of alpha. Functional alleles tested have moderate [HTR2C, HTR2A, mu opioid receptor: 0.1] or high [SLCA4 & COMT: 0.4] frequencies, & functional polymorphisms known to affect alcoholism ADH2 Arg47His & ALDH2 Glu487Lys have 5-10 fold effects. Therefore, our smallest datasets [n=50] have 58% power at the p less than 0.01 level; power is essentially 100% for larger datasets available for alcoholism [several datasets], schizophrenia, OCD, anorexia nervosa, SAD, & bipolar. For lower effect size, power at p<0.01 remains > 0.8 for the association strength of 0.1, in the larger datasets. Relationship of candidate genes and alleles to behavior: DRD2. The DRD2 dopamine receptor, \"Reward Deficiency Gene\" hypothesis, was tested in SW Indians with three markers: the Taq1A marker previously implicated, an STR, & Ser311Cys, which impairs signal transduction & which is far more abundant [0.16] in this particular population as compared to Caucasians [0.03]. Because it impairs function, Cys311 is a surrogate for unknown DRD2 alleles that attenuate function to a similar extent or by the same mechanism [transduction]. There was neither sibpair linkage nor association, although the dataset included 15 Cys311 Cys311 homozygotes. Previously, we reported early negative results for DRD2 & alcoholism in ethnically matched, psychiatrically interviewed alcoholics & controls, in severe alcoholics, & in alcoholics with parental alcoholism. We identified large ethnic differences in DRD2 allele & haplotype frequencies, & helped discover Ser311Cys. The results suggest there is scant evidence for a substantial role for DRD2 variation in alcohol vulnerability. However, to monitor functional variants at DRD2, wedeveloped high throughput assays for Ser311Cys & -141DelT. With a ten-locus DRD2 haplotype, we find positive linkage to opioid dependence in two large datasets. Candidate alleles to behavior: Serotonin transporter. A functional serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism was associated with dimensionally measured anxiety. Quantitative linkage in 366 Finnish sibpairs linked this polymorphism to the two anxiety-related subscales of the TPQ [Mazzanti]. Function was further pursued by in vivo B-CIT SPECT imaging of transporter density. In controls [but not alcoholics], the lower transcribing s allele was associated with lower brain transporter density. Alcoholics experience sustained changes in serotonin transporter function, for example due to alcohol-induced serotonin release or effects of withdrawal. The polymorphism was linked to metabolic activity in amygdala induced by a cognitive fear challenge. A rare SERT missense variant was linked to severe psychopathology in two families. Discovery of a new common functional SERT HTTLPR allele enabled linkage to OCD in two populations. We built on findings from mouse genetic models to identify a potential role for the 5HT1B receptor in a subtype of alcoholism. HTR1B was implicated as an alcohol preference gene by a mouse alcohol preference QTL & subsequent discovery that the HTR1B knockout mouse exhibited increased aggression & preference for alcohol. As a terminal autoreceptor, 5HT1B modulates serotonin release & was an excellent candidate for variation in alcohol preference & aggressivity, independently of the mouse findings. Aggressive & impulsive behaviors are represented in two psychiatric diagnoses - ASPD & IED [Intermittent Explosive Disorder] & alcohol preference is a component of alcoholism. We studied 640 Finnish subjects included 350 sibpairs [220 unaffected, 79 discordant & 51 affected] & 418 Southwestern Indians including 305 sibpairs [223 unaffected, 71 discordant & 11 affected pairs] & classified for the presence absence of antisocial alcoholism [DSMIII-R alcoholism plus either ASPD or IED]. In this single-locus study, evidence for i.b.d. linkage was found in both datasets [p=0.04 & p=0.01] & association to HTR1B was also detected in Finns. Relationship of candidate genes and alleles to behavior: TPH2 was linked to anxiety dysphoria in multiple populations and the linked haplotype was shown to be associated with low serotonin turnover as indexed by 5HIAA levels, a DISC1 haplotype linkage to schizophrenia by Peltonen et al was replicated. COMT Val158Met & Frontal lobe function: Executive cognitive functions are thought to be impaired in several psychiatric diseases: alcoholism, ADHD, & schizophrenia (SZ). Patients with SZ, & to a lesser extent their healthy siblings, have deficits in working memory & show excess cortical activity [& are thus said to be inefficient] during these tasks. We found an allele-dosage relationship of a functional COMT variant to frontal cognitive function. The relationship is seen across several populations differing in baseline cognitive function: SZ, moderate-severe head injury, & controls. Dopamine enhances prefrontal cortical efficiency. Met158, a common COMT variant, leads to four-fold reduction in COMT activity & was thus an excellent candidate allele for frontal lobe cognitive function. Wisconsin Card Sort performance was evaluated versus COMT genotype in 75 controls, 184 SZs, & 222 siblings of SZs, with discovery of a remarkable allele-dosage relationship was found to perseverative errors in each group. This finding was replicated in controls and head-injured patients, and expanded by study of frontal metabolic activity during the N-back task. The Val158 allele was associated with increased metabolic activity in frontal lobe consistent with the hypothesis of diminished cortical efficiency. Val may have counter-advantages: in a two populations Met predicted anxiety in women and decreased frontal EEG coherence, and in two other populations the Met allele was associated with lower resiliency to pain stress. The GABAA alpha 2 (chr 4 cluster) and alpha 6 (chr 5 cluster) recptors were linked to alcoholism. These linkages followed up our earlier whole genome scan in SW Inddians. The alpha 2 finding replicated the haplotype found by Edenberg and showed the linkage may be mediated through the anxiety dimension.',\n",
       " 'LNG is a groundbreaking laboratory for studies relating brain gene polymorphisms to in vitro function as well as in vivo functional measures. The polymorphism function associations are congruent with the known molecular neurobiology of the transmitters and proteins and include dopamine transporter genotype dopamine transporter density in striatum, serotonin transporter genotype serotonin transporter density in raphe nucleus, COMT genotype metabolic activity in frontal lobe, and the relationship of COMT to pain stress and ability to activate endogenous opioid release and metabolic activity in amygdala and other parts of the limbic system. Functional variants are the endgame of positional cloning and are invaluable for selecting the appropriate phenotypes for linkage studies. LNG is screening noncoding sequences for effects on transcription and RNA processing, and evaluating certain coding variants of GPCRs for altered ligand affinity, signal transduction and receptor downregulation. To evaluate effects of sequence variants [including unknown ones] on imprinting or DNA transcription and RNA processing, we created a 5\\' exonuclease-based method differential allele expression using transcribed SNPs as endogenous reporters. This method was validated and used to detect haplotype effects on expression of COMT alleles previously implicated in behavior. This work raises the possibility of a double-hit for COMT in individuals who more highly express the high activity Val158 allele. Due to neuroadaptation, phenotypic effects of functionally significant alleles may be difficult to discern except in cellular expression systems in which the genetic background on which the various alleles are assayed is identical. We use transfected cells for this purpose. To measure \"downstream\" effects mediated through activation of adenylcyclase, we developed a reporter gene construct incorporating a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) promoter flanking the coding sequence for a red-shifted variant of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which allows quantitation of gene expression in living cells. 5HT1A is a somatodendritic autoreceptor on serotonin neurons in the raphe nuclei and is also expressed postsynaptically with highest densities in the limbic system. Pharmacobehavioral studies have revealed a significant role for 5HT1A in irritable aggression. We detected two rare amino acid substitutions in the amino-terminal, extracellular domain. Gly22Ser [rare allele 0.002] was observed in three Finnish Caucasians. Ile28Val [rare allele 0.005] is present in various populations. The Ser22 allele was ineffective in down-regulating the receptor after exposure to the agonist 8-OH DPAT. We detected two missense substitutions in an intracellular loop of the 5HT2A receptor: Ala447Val [allele frequency 0.007] and His452Tyr [allele frequency 0.093. Due to the high frequency of Tyr452 and the expression of authentic 5HT2A in platelets, we were able to compare the functional properties of the His452 and Tyr452 alleles in eight His452 Tyr452 heterozygotes to eight His452 His452 homozygotes matched for sex, age and diagnosis. After 10 mM serotonin, calcium mobilization was reduced in His452 Tyr452 heterozygotes and decay of stimulated intracellular levels was prolonged. These observations were replicated in transiently transfected cells. A 5HT2C Cys23Ser variant we detected has an allele frequency of 0.13. HTR2C is X-linked; therefore, 13% of males are hemizygous for Ser23 and 87% are hemizygous for Cys23. Both alleles were expressed in two highly distinctive cellular environments: cos-7 kidney cells and Xenopus oocytes, and we found that Ser23 allele is constitutively active and therefore downregulated. Other SNPs we detected which alter ligand affinity are OPRM1 Asn40Asp, shown by Bond et al to alter ligand affinity and the DRD2 dopamine polymorphism Ser311Cys, which alters affinity and transduction. The functionality of the serotonin transporter [SLCA4] polymorphism which is associated with anxiety and alters in vitro transcription was pursued. If the mechanism of the SLCA4 linkage to anxiety is to alter transcription, a validating step would be to demonstrate an effect of the polymorphism on serotonin transporter density in human brain. B-CIT SPECT imaging was used for genotype transporter density studies of both the dopamine transporter [visualized in striatum] and serotonin transporter [quantitated in midbrain]. We found a significant relationship of dopamine transporter allele to dopamine transporter density, the direction congruent with dopamine transporter allele associations to ADHD and with the relationship of the allele associated with reduced DAT density to cocaine-induced paranoia. Next SLCA4 was found to be related to serotonin transporter density in midbrain of alcoholics and controls. In controls, the lower transcribing s allele was indeed associated with lower transporter density. Serotonin transporter genotype predicted amygdala metabolic activity to a cognitive fear challenge, providing a bridge between the functionality of this variant and the complex behavior. A serotonin transporter amino acid substitution was detected in two families. This allele leads to higher transporter function and to severe behavioral problems: Asperger\\'s Syndrome, severe,treatment resistant OCD, and anorexia nervosa. Frontal cognitive function is critical in alcoholism and other substance abuse, where impulse control may be impaired, in SZ, where specific deficits have been identified, and in behavioral disinhibition syndrome following head injury. The HTTLPR locus has been the object of over 300 geteic studies, but we discovered a new, common allele. This A>G SNP in the first of two extra repeats defining the L allele alters mRNA expression by creating an AP2 binding site. Using this new information, we linked the high activity HTTLPR genotype to OCD in both an NIMH case control dataset (D. Murphy) and replicated this finding in a transmission equilibrium dataset from Toronto (J. Kennedy). The common (allele frequency=0.42), functional COMT Val158Met was linked to frontal cortical function in datasets with widely differing baseline performances. Gene dosage relationship to frontal lobe cognitive performance on was seen in controls, head injured patients, schizophrenics, and siblings of schizophrenics. COMT genotype was linked to frontal cortical coherence. These studies were followed by metabolic brain imaging (BOLD, MRI) during a working memory task which accesses functions of the frontal lobe. As predicted, the Val158 allele correlated with cortical inefficiency during the working memory task. Recently, we have linked Met158 to effects which may be evolutionarily counterbalancing: namely, anxiety in women and diminished pain stress tolerance and ability of the endogenous opioid system to activate after a painful stimulus. BDNF Val66Met was found to impair trafficking and secretion of the peptide, and was linked to Hippocampal metabolic activity and volume. Using differential allele expression in postmortem human brain, functional haplotypes were defined for both MPDZ and NPY and we discovered linkage of NPY (a peptide involved in stress anxiety response) to anxiety.',\n",
       " \"A strategy of LNG is to test candidate alleles against intermediate phenotypes including alcohol response and benzodiazepine response, which are predictive of vulnerability. Datasets for these two intermediate phenotypes have been developed in collaboration with their acknowledged experts: M. Schuckit who has prospectively followed a cohort of 450 men and has available psychophysiological and subjective measures of response as well as clinical outcome, and D. Cowley, who had collected sensitive and accurate eye-movement measures following benzodiazepine challenge [using the paradigm originally developed and brought to Seattle by D. Hommer, now Acting Chief of LCS]. Thus far we have reported preliminary, but positive results with a common, non-conservative GABAA alpha6 amino acid substitution discovered by LNG as well as with the functional serotonin transporter polymorphism HTTLPR described by P. Lesch [Schuckit et al; Iwata et al]. The linkage to HTTLPR was improved by use of a new functional allele we discovered at this locus. The GABAA alpha6 gene represents an example of where we have been able to find convergence between a rodent genetic finding and the human. Korpi et al detected a GABAA alpha6 amino acid substitution altering the sensitivity of this receptor to alcohol and benzodiazepines and this substitution predicts the difference in alcohol sensitivity observed between alcohol accepting and non-accepting Finnish rats. The GABAA clusters on human chromosomes 4 and 5 are implicated by linkage studies in the human [LNG, Long et al] and in the rodent [Portland group], respectively. Nevertheless, except for the GABAA alpha6 result in the rat, alpha6 might not have been the first GABAA receptor we evaluated in the human because the GABAA alpha6 is restricted in its expression to cerebellum. As discussed above, LNG was able to detect a common, non-conservative amino acid substitution Pro385Ser and obtain preliminary evidence for involvement in alcohol and benzodiazepine sensitivity The alcohol response dataset is being expanded according to M.Schuckit's resources to collect these individuals. We now have convergent data from two human isolates for a role for GABAA receptors in alcoholism. Using a six-locus haplotype for the Chr 5 GABAA gene cluster, we detected linkage and linkage disequilibrium in alcoholism in both Finns and SW American Indians. TrimHap (MacLean et al, 2000) was used to establish the most likely location of a gene influencing alcoholism. In both samples, this location was in the alpha6 or in the region of alpha6 and the adjacent gene for the alpha2 subunit, a subunit which is necessary for modulation of GABAA receptor function by ethanol. This work has recently been expanded with multi-locus dense SNP maps for both the chr 5 cluster and chr 4 clusters. Pharmacogenetics of treatment response. A radical change in alcoholism research is that several pharmacological treatments have recently become available that improve the ability of alcoholics to maintain abstinence. The previously available drug - disulfiram - had a direct counterpart in the ALDH2 Glu487Lys variant which created a natural blockade of the same metabolic enzyme. The new drugs, particularly sertraline and naltrexone, could also point directly to molecular targets which could be either sources of variation in treatment response or sources of differential vulnerability. Two principal gene targets are the serotonin transporter [sertraline] and the m opioid receptor [naltrexone], and other gene targets are also directly inferred: HTR1A and HTR1B autoreceptors, postsynaptic serotonin receptors, opioid propeptides, and various genes involved in the function of interacting neurotransmitters such as dopamine. LNG is focusing efforts in sequence variant detection towards these genes and by initiating a major collaboration led by Dr. S. O'Malley towards the pharmacogenetics of naltrexone and sertralinne response among alcoholics in a NW Indian tribe and towards the pharmacogenetics of naltrexone and acamprosate in the COMBINE multicenter study. The human research protocol for the O'Malley study is now approved by the NIAAA IRB and this study is underway. LNG's molecular studies have already yielded a common, nonconservative mu opioid receptor variant which M. Kreek and colleagues have reported alters affinity of the receptor for endomorphin. Effect of this polylmorphism on phenotype is now being studied in large cohorts of alcoholics and opioid addicts. Ten Tribes Study. LNG is a leading exponent of gene environment interactions in alcoholism, including the use of cross-population studies. The Ten Tribes Study is a gene environment interaction study encompassing the collection of the first large multi-population dataset specifically suited for evaluation of gene environment interaction: the Ten Tribes Study. This study, which is approximately 2 3 complete involves the collection of DNA and psychiatric interview [AUDADIS] data on 300 demographically sampled individuals from 10 different American Indian tribes, including tribes with widely disparate rates of alcoholism and alcohol associated problems. This dataset will be used to study the effects of social and historical determinants on alcoholism, effects of alcoholism on communities [especially rates and types of trauma], and interaction of genetic factors with environmental loadings and thresholds.\",\n",
       " 'We hypothesized that genetic variation among receptors excitatory neurotransmitter receptors, growth factor, and growth factor receptor genes play an important role in modifying neuronal plasticity. It is also plausible that allelic variation in shared signal transduction pathways among different neurotransmitters (such as glutamate and serotonin neurotransmitters) and their receptors are critical to creating and maintaining neuronal connectivity may also play a role in mediating early responses (sensitization) or conditioned responses (addiction) to alcohol or other drugs. The NMDA class of glutamate receptors, named for the specific compound (or agonist) that activates the receptor, is directly inhibited by ethanol (an antagonist) and it is thought that changes in NMDA receptor activity is involved in ethanol-induced adaptations, such as tolerance and dependence. Recent findings have bolstered the idea that chronic ethanol changes NMDA receptor subunit composition, particularly of NR2 subunits in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala (brain regions known to have critical roles in anxiety behaviors, emotion, response to stress, and drug dependence). In addition, a characteristic or so-called intermediate phenotype, associated with increased risk of alcohol consumption and dependence in family history positive individuals is the reduced sensitivity of individuals to the dysphoric effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, which may signal a reduced response to ethanol. To capture sequence variant data at glutamate receptor genes, we initially surveyed the entire family of ionotrophic glutamate receptors (IGR), composed of the NMDA, AMPA, and KA subtypes. We used screening technologies, including denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, DNA melting analysis, and direct sequencing as well as information mining of public (e.g. dbSNP, ENSEMBL) and private (i.e. Celera Discovery System) sequence databases to discover novel coding region and promoter regions single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A collection of 38 missense variants were identified by the informatics and resequencing approaches in several of these receptor genes. Of particular interest were eight SNPs in NR1 and NR2B subunit genes. Four of the variants resulted in an amino acid change (missense variants). Three are candidate promoter variants. All of the variants were previously unidentified. In particular the NR1 gene variant 8396G>A resulted in a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at position 744. When expressed in human embryonic kidney cells with a native NR2A subunit, this receptor variant demonstrated prolonged desensitization to agonist (glutamate) and showed increased resistance to NMDA-mediated excitotoxcity. The three GRIN2B missense variants, Ser116Thr, Leu120Ile, and Thr275Ala are localized to the extracellular ligand binding or modulatory domain of the NR2B subunit. Of the variants we identified by resequencing approaches, only NR2B Thr275Ala had a minor allele frequency above 1% (0.02 in U.S. Caucasians). This variant, however, may be of particular interest since the amino acid residue involved maps near the ifenprodil binding site on the NR2B subunit. Also of note was the low rate of SNP confirmation using computational SNPs from public databases. Using direct sequence analysis, on 50 individuals, only 18% of the computational SNPs could be confirmed. Each of the variants discovered and validated must now be functionally characterized in order to determine its potential impact on IGR function and to determine it contribution to alcoholism-related phenotypes.',\n",
       " 'A study documenting for the first time the role of the liver as a target of the metabolic effects of endocannabinoids in diet-induced obesity has now been published. In this study we found that endogenous cannabinoids acting at CB1 receptors (CB1) stimulate appetite, and CB1 antagonists show promise in the treatment of obesity. CB1 knockout (CB1- -) mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity even though their caloric intake is similar to wild-type mice, suggesting that endocannabinoids also regulate fat metabolism. We investigated the possible role of endocannabinoids in the regulation of hepatic lipogenesis. Activation of CB1 in mice increases the hepatic gene expression of the lipogenic transcription factor sterol response element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) and its targets acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Treatment with a CB1 agonist also increases de novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver or in isolated hepatocytes, which express CB1. High fat diet increases hepatic levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide, CB1 density, and basal rates of fatty acid synthesis, and the latter is reduced by CB1 blockade. In the hypothalamus, where FAS inhibitors elicit anorexia, SREBP1c and FAS expression are similarly affected by CB1 ligands. We conclude that anandamide acting at hepatic CB1 contributes to diet-induced obesity, and that the FAS pathway may be a common molecular target for central appetitive and peripheral metabolic regulation. Endocannabinoids acting at CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1) increase appetite. In view of the predominant presynaptic localization of CB1 in the brain, we tested the hypothesis that the orexigenic effect of endocannabinoids involves inhibition of the release of a tonically active anorexigenic mediator, such as the peptide product of the cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript (CART). The CB1 antagonist rimonabant inhibited food intake in food-restricted wild-type mice, but not in their CART-deficient littermates. Mice deficient in fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for the in vivo metabolism of the endocannabinoid anandamide, have reduced levels of CART immunoreactive nerve fibers and terminals in several brain regions implicated in appetite control, including the arcuate, dorsomedial and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, the amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the nucleus accumbens, and treatment of FAAH- - mice with rimonabant, 3 mg kg day for 7 days, increased CART levels toward those seen in FAAH+ + wild-type controls. In contrast, no difference in the density of CART immunoreactive fibers was observed in the median eminence and the paraventricular nucleus of FAAH+ + and FAAH- - mice. Acute treatment of wild-type mice with the cannabinoid agonist HU-210 resulted in elevated CART levels in the dorsomedial nucleus and the shell portion of the nucleus accumbens. These observations are compatible with CART being a downstream mediator of the CB1-mediated orexigenic effect of endogenous anandamide We have continued a phase I II clinical trial testing the safety and efficacy of the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant in reducing the desire to drink among heavy drinkers. The study, approved by the institional IRB, will include 40 subjects on a double-blind, placebo controlled basis. Subjects take 20 mg rimonabant daily for two weeks, following which they participate in a test where they have the option to drink 8 glasses of liquor over a 4 hour period, followed by a neuropsychiatric assessment for their subjective desire and response to drinking as well as a neuroendocrine evaluation. The study is currently in progress, we have just enrolled subject #24 and are aiming to complete the study by late next spring. If found effective, rimonabant may become only the fourth drug to be used for the treatment of alcoholics in the United States (after disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate).',\n",
       " 'Earlier studies provided evidence for a novel endothelial cannabinoid receptor mediating vasodilation in certain vascular beds (Offertaler et al., Mol Pharmacol 63:699-705, 2003; Begg et al., J Biol Chem 278:46188-94, 2003). In more recent experiments we found that a receptor with the same pharmacological properties mediates stimulation of endothelial cell migration, as quantified in a transwell chamber, and thus may be involved in angiogenesis. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), abnormal cannabidiol stimulates migration, an effect that is blocked by the compound O-1918, by pertussis toxin, or by PI3 kinase inhibitors, but not by CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonists. In CHO cells stably transfected with the EDG-1 receptor, sphingosine-1-phosphate, but not abnormal cannabidiol, stimulated migration. Thus, an endothelial receptor sensitivie to abnormal cannabidiol and distinct from CB1, CB2 or EDG-1 may regulate cell migration and angiogenesis. The endogenous ligand for this receptor remains to be identified. Our earlier studies implicated endocannabinoids and CB1 receptors in endotoxin (LPS)-induced hypotension (FASEB J 12:1035-44, 1998; J Biol Chem 278:45034-39, 2003). Recent evidence indicates the existence of cannabinoid receptors distinct from CB1 or CB2 which are inhibited by SR141716 but not by other CB1 antagonists such as AM251. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, i.v. injection of 10 mg kg LPS elicits hypotension associated with profound decreases in cardiac contractility, moderate tachycardia and an increase in lower body vascular resistance. Pretreatment with 3 mg kg SR141716 prevented the hypotension and decrease in cardiac contractility, slightly attenuated the increase in peripheral resistance and had no effect on the tachycardia caused by LPS, whereas pretreatment with 3 mg kg AM251 did not affect any of these responses. The LPS-induced hypotension and its inhibition by SR141716 were similar in pentobarbital-anesthetized wild-type, CB1- - and CB1- - CB2- - mice. We conclude that SR141716 inhibits the acute hemodynamic effects of LPS by interacting with a cardiac receptor distinct from CB1 or CB2, which mediates negative inotropy and may be activated by anandamide or a related endocannabinoid released during endotoxemia. Anandamide and cannabinoid receptors have been implicated in the hypotension in various forms of shock and in advanced liver cirrhosis. Anandamide also activates vanilloid TRPV1 receptors on sensory nerve terminals, triggering the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide that elicits vasorelaxation in isolated blood vessels in vitro. However, the contribution of TRPV1 receptors to the in vivo hypotensive effect of anandamide is equivocal. We compared the cardiac performance of anesthetized TRPV1 knockout (TRPV1- -) mice and their wild-type (TRPV1+ +) littermates and analysed in detail the haemodynamic effects of anandamide using the Millar pressure-volume conductance catheter system. Baseline cardiovascular parameters as well as systolic and diastolic function at different preloads were similar in TRPV1- - and TRPV1+ + mice. The predominant hypotensive response to bolus intravenous injections of anandamide and the associated decrease in cardiac contractility and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were similar in TRPV1+ + and TRPV1- - mice, as was the ability of the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716 to completely block these effects. In TRPV1+ + mice, this hypotensive response was preceded by a transient, profound drop in cardiac contractility and heart rate and increase in TPR, followed by a brief pressor response, which were unaffected by SR141716 and were absent in TRPV1- - mice. These results indicate that mice lacking TRPV1 receptors have a normal cardiovascular profile and their predominant cardiovascular depressor response to anandamide is mediated through CB1 receptors. The role of TRPV1 receptors is limited to thhe transient activation of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex by very high initial plasma concentrations of anandamide. We examined the possible role of the endocannabinergic system in cardiovascular regulation in hypertension. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), CB1 receptor antagonists increase blood pressure and left ventricular contractile performance. Conversely, preventing the degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide by an inhibitor of fatty acid amidohydrolase reduces blood pressure, cardiac contractility and vascular resistance to levels in normotensive rats, and these effects are prevented by CB1 antagonists. Similar changes are observed in two additional models of hypertension, whereas in normotensive control rats the same parameters remain unaffected by any of these treatments. CB1 agonists lower blood pressure much more in SHR than in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), and the expression of CB1 is increased in heart and aortic endothelium of SHR compared to WKY. These findings indicate that endocannabinoids tonically suppress cardiac contractility in hypertension, and that enhancing the CB1-mediated cardiodepressor and vasodilator effects of endogenous anandamide by blocking its hydrolysis can normalize blood pressure. Targeting the endocannabinoid system offers novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of hypertension.',\n",
       " \"The cellular and molecular mechanisms of alcohol's actions in the nervous system have not been established. This project investigated alcohol's effects on synaptic mechanisms using the patch-clamp recording technique. Ethanol inhibits NMDA-activated ion current over a concentration range associated with intoxication (5-50 Mm). In addition, the potency of several alcohols for inhibiting NMDA current is related to their intoxicating potency, suggesting that alcohol-induced inhibition of NMDA channel function may contribute to intoxication. Analysis of mechanism indicates that ethanol inhibits NMDA current by altering gating of the channel, rather than by affecting channel conductance, ion permeance or regulatory sites on the channel. Ethanol concentrations associated with general anesthesia (50-100 Mm) inhibit kainate- and quisqualate-activated currents. The anesthetic agents, trichloroethanol, pentobarbital and volatile anesthetics, also inhibit kainate- and quisqualate-activated currents, suggesting that inhibition of these channels may contribute to the anesthetic effects of ethanol. The current associated with GABA-A channels is potentiated by ethanol (1-40 Mm) in some neurons, but is not affected in others. Since benzodiazepines selectively potentiate GABA-A current, the potentiation of this current by ethanol may contribute to the anxiolytic effects of ethanol. Behavioral studies have implicated 5-HT3 channels in the reinforcing properties of several drugs. Ethanol (25-200 Mm) potentiates 5-HT3 current; whereas, cocaine competitively inhibits serotonin activation of 5-HT3 channels (pA2=5.4; Kb=3.8 Um). Several types of ATP-gated channels can be identified; one type is inhibited by ethanol (IC50=68 Mm). Methanol is less potent, and propanol is more potent; however, 1-butanol and isopentanol are without effect on this current, suggesting that alcohols with 3 carbons or less interact a small hydrophobic pocket in the channel protein. The observation suggest that neurotransmitter-gated ion channels are molecular sites of alcohol action in the nervous system. \",\n",
       " 'Alcohol is classified as a central nervous system depressant. The mechanisms that underlie this alcohol-induced depression of nervous system excitability, however, are poorly understood. This project investigated the intrinsic mechanisms involved in the regulation of nerve cell excitability and the effects of ethanol on those mechanisms. To identify neurons that have been isolated for patch-clamp recording, neurons were retrogradely labeled in vivo using fluorescent dyes. Fast blue was found to be a suitable tracer for studying the electrical properties of identified neurons after isolation in vitro. To study the regulation of excitability mechanisms, neurons were dissociated from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of adult rats and maintained for over three weeks in tissue culture without serum or added growth factors. Under these conditions, the Na currents of all neurons studied were sensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX). By contrast, in neurons freshly isolated or cultured in the presence of serum and nerve growth factor (NGF), both TTX-sensitive and TTX-insensitive Na currents were observed. The effect of NGF was tested by culturing adult rat DRG neurons in the presence or absence of NGF in a defined medium without background cells. In the absence of NGF, only TTX- sensitive Na currents were observed; however, in the presence of NGF, both TTX-sensitive and TTX-insensitive Na currents were elicited. The results suggest that NGF may regulate the expression of voltage-gated ion channels in adult mammalian neurons. In addition, several types of voltage-gated ion channels have been characterized in adult mammalian neurons. These include: TTX-sensitive and TTX-insensitive Na channels; transient (T type) and long-lasting (L type) Ca channels; and transient (A), sustained (delayed rectifier), calcium-activated (C) and muscarine inhibited (M) K channels. The effect of ethanol was tested on these voltage-gated ion channels in different types of mammalian neurons and it was found to have little or no effect in a pharmacologic concentration range (5 to 100 MM).

       " \" of Work: The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), the NIA's major research program on human aging, has been conducted at the Gerontology Research Center since 1958. The study represents a consortium of scientists who work to characterize normal and pathological aging. The BLSA consists of a series of longitudinal and cross-sectional studies oriented toward description, identification of mechanism, prediction and intervention in human aging processes. The scientific goals include identifying age differences among individuals and changes in individuals over time; to characterize transitions from normal to pathological aging; to determine the relative contribution of aging, disease processes, cohort effects and secular effects; to expand scientific understanding about predictors and risk factors for specific diseases and for other end points related to successes and failures of adaptation to aging processes; and where possible to explore mechanisms for normal and or pathological changes. Scientists working with BLSA are assigned to 11 sections of 7 laboratories in addition to the LSB. The Chief, LSB, is the Associate Scientific Director, NIA for the BLSA and LSB staff administer and manage the BLSA operations and the clinical evaluations of the research volunteers. LSB scientists also conduct research with the BLSA. Responsibility for data management of the BLSA was transferred to the Research Resources Branch. The BLSA Steering Committee, an internally compromised committee of GRC scientists and the ASD, is responsible for reviewing new proposals for research with the BLSA to determine the relevance of the research for the BLSA. An external scientific advisory board has been identified for the BLSA. A plan has been devised and implemented to increase active participation by BLSA research volunteers who have had difficulty getting to the GRC by arranging their transportation. \",\n",
       " ' of work: This project focuses on the mechanism involved in regulating the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin and the transport of oxygen to the tissues. Emphasis is placed on ways in which these functions are impaired and change with age. These studies have focused on the oxidation of hemoglobin, which produces nonfunctional hemoglobin and the simultaneous release of oxyradicals. The enhancement of these oxidative processes under hypoxic conditions is being explored as a possible source of tissue and organ damage, which would be exacerbated during aging. Studies are also included which are directed at the stability of the entire erythrocyte and the erythrocyte membrane. Animal and human studies are performed to investigate possible functional impairment associated with red cell damage. Erythrocyte nitric oxide is being studied as a measure of nitric oxide synthesis and nitrite reduction in order to oxplore the possible role of the erythrocyte in regulating blood flow by releasing nitric oxide. The interaction of amyloids with the erythrocyte is being investigated to determine whether the red cell plays a role in the transport of amyloids and in amyloid induced oxidative stress.',\n",
       " 'Age-associated changes in immune function in humans and animals are quite important with regard not only to the general health of aged persons but also to the general features of the immune system itself. Elderly subjects have been shown to be more susceptible to viral and bacterial infections and are believed to be more susceptible to cancer. There have been a number of hypotheses for the diminished immune responses observed in elderly subjects including involution of the thymus, active immunosuppression, replication senescence of immune cells, cellular signaling defects, and alterations in cytokine expression profiles. A series of clinical studies has revealed that elderly subjects, in contrast to their younger counterparts, exhibit poor cellular and humoral immune responses to vaccines even in the presence of standard adjuvants. Currently, many laboratories are focusing their research efforts into developing more effective stimulants for use with known vaccines to be tested with elderly populations. However, the poor description of alterations in innate and acquired immune function during the aging process has limited therapeutic intervention. The ongoing work utilizes either peripheral white blood cells obtained from normal healthy volunteers of different ages or lymphoid tissues and celsl from aged rodents and primates to gain insight into the biological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms underlying age-associated changes in human immune function. In comparison with immune cells obtained from younger individuals, aged leukocytes also display distinctive patterns of protein phosphorylation, cytokine synthesis and gene expression, effects on cell migration and trafficking, and cell-cycle progression. As several immune subpopulations (e.g., CD28-, CD25+) have been shown to be dramatically increased in the circulation during various disease states (including arthritis, AIDS, and aging), we believe that more detailed molecular and biochemical analysis of these subsets will not only yield valuable information about the immune deficits associated with aging and disease but may also lead to possible immunotherapeutic interventions to boost immune responses.',\n",
       " 'The vast majority of solid tumors have a very low growth fraction at the time they become clinically evident, usually in the range of 3-7%. When the tumor is treated, the growth fraction increases in an effort to maintain the tumor cell mass. This is reminiscent of the organization of most organ systems. Resting bone marrow stem cells are recruited into cycle when under the influence of a myelotoxic stimulus. Surgical removal of a portion of the liver stimulates the recruitment of hepatocytes into the cell cycle to replace the removed tissue. Other examples could also be cited. What is of interest to us is how a tumor cell, with its many genetic abnormalities that tend to promote proliferation, is pulled out of the cell cycle in the first place. Some gene product that is working in the resting tumor cells has managed to antagonize all the oncogene mutations and missing or malfunctioning tumor suppressor gene products and stop the cell from dividing; and it does this reversibly. When the tumor perceives an attack that reduces its volume, cells can be recruited back into the cell cycle. We are separating fresh lymphoma specimens into dividing and nondividing populations, isolating total RNA, and using RAGEtag techniques, characterizing genes that are expressed in resting cells but not in dividing cells. Such messages will be isolated, their genes identified, and then the cDNA will be introduced into dividing cells to look for growth arrest.',\n",
       " 'We initially observed, and it has been widely reproduced, that T cells from tumor-bearing hosts are defective in their signalling in response to antigen and in their function. A variety of defects are noted including defective nuclear translocation of the p65 NF-kappa B transcription factor, shortened half-lives for a number of cellular proteins such as TCR-zeta chain and signalling kinases of the src family, among others, and a deviation of the cytokine production profile toward Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) and away from Th1 cytokines (interferon- gamma, TNF). Evidence of suppression of immune function in mice in whom tumor is growing in hollow fibers in the peritoneal cavity without any cell-cell contact in the host suggest that a soluble tumor factor is responsible for the defect in cellular immunity. We have devised a method of reproducing these tumor- induced changes in normal T cells in vitro and are in the process of isolating the tumor-derived factor(s) responsible for the changes. In agreement with this finding, we are able to demonstrate the immunosuppressive properties of the pleural fluid isolated from cancer patients, and we are in process of isolating and characterizing the tumor-derived factor(s) from the pleural fluids.',\n",
       " 'CD28-mediated costimulatory signal plays a pivotal role in the outcome of many immune responses including cytolytic responses in tumor and autoimmune diseases. Depending on the primary stimulation, CD28 can initiate multiple intracellular signaling pathways including a pathway that is insensitive to immunosuppressive drug, Cyclosporin A (CsA). This CsA- insensitive pathway is believed to be involved in graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) during allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Our current objectives focus on three areas: (1) characterization of the CsA-resistant rapamycin-sensitive pathway of T cell activation; (2) examination of the physiological significance of this pathway; and (3) the effect of aging on the rapamycin-sensitive pathway. Our recent work has demonstrated that the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin selectively affects the CsA-resistant pathway. Our initial studies have focused on the mechanism of activation of the IL-2 gene in a CsA-resistant manner. We found that the effects of rapamycin on the IL-2 expression was due to alteration in IL-2 mRNA stability. More recently, we have also shown that activation of T cells by IL-12 is resistant to CsA, but sensitive to rapamycin. As the intracellular target of rapamycin is mTOR, we are investigating the mechanism of activation of mTOR, particularly the role p85S6K1, an isoform of p70S6K1, in turning on mTOR downstream signaling leading to protein translation. Regarding the physiological role of the resistant pathway, we have observed the effect of cytokine signaling, particularly the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 but not individual cytokine alone, in activating resting human peripheral blood T cells in producing IFN- in a CsA-resistant, but rapamycin-sensitive manner. This cytokine-mediated activation of resting T cells was independent of antigen. We are currently investigating the in vivo physiological role of this cytokine signaling pathway.',\n",
       " 'One of the most effected genes in the human tumors is p53. About 60% of human cancers contain mutation in p53 gene. Although the regulation of p53 is well studied, very little is known about the regulation of mutant p53. We have shown previously that a human B-lymphoma cell line (RL) harboring mutant p53, which is refractory to the growth inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta),can be rendered sensitive to TGF-beta by induction of receptors for TGF-beta with low concentrations of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). We have also shown the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-beta was associated with a down regulation of mutant p53. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms involved in the down regulation of mutant p53 by TGF-beta, and to examine whether the down regulation of mutant p53 is responsible for the TGF-beta-mediated growth suppression. We are also interested in identifying the gain-of-function properties of mutant p53 in RL cells. The mutant p53 from RL and wild type p53 will be transfected separately in a human colon tumor cell line, HCT 116, which has p53 null background. The RNA from these cells will be used in micro array analysis using home made cDNA array chip to examine the expression pattern of several thousand genes. Genes that are differentially regulated by different p53 will be identified, and the roles of some of the candidate genes will studied.',\n",

Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we demonstrated atrophy of the corpus callosum, a marker of neocortical neuronal loss, in nondemented Down syndrome (trisomy 21) adults compared with age-matched healthy controls. Down syndrome subjects are at risk for Alzheimer disease, due to duplication of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21. Measuring corpus callosum volume with MRI could help to identify subjects in the general population with mild cognitive insufficiency who later will develop Alzheimer disease. 2. Automated voxel-based morphometry was used to analyze structural magnetic resonance images of brains from 27 non-demented Down syndrome adults, an at-risk group for Alzheimer disease, of different ages. In this group, grey matter volume declined with advancing age in numerous cortical regions, suggesting that brain atrophy occurs and progresses before clinical dementia becomes evident in Down syndrome.',\n",
       " \"1. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a nutritionally essential n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) that is concentrated in brain synaptic membranes and is thought to be deficient in patients with bipolar disorder and Alzheimer disease. It is important to understand how brain DHA is regulated. In post-weaning rats diet deprived of n-3 PUFAs for 15 weeks, we showed with radiolabeled DHA and kinetic modeling that brain DHA is lost 2-3 fold more slowly than in control diet rats. We are examining how the brain reduces it's rate of DHA loss. (DeMar et al 2004) 2. Alpha-linolenic acid, a n-3 PUFA precursor of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), does not contribute appreciably to DHA synthesis in brain phospholipids of adult rats fed a diet containing DHA. Attempts to replenish purported low levels of brain DHA in patients with Alzheimer disease or bipolar disorder should add DHA rather than its shorter chain precursors to the diet. (Demar et al 2005) 3. Arachidonic acid (AA) participates in neuroreceptor initiated brain signal transduction. We applied our fatty acid method with PET to quantify atrophy-corrected AA incorporation rates into brain phospholipids of young and elderly healthy human volunteers. We also measured their regional cerebral blood flow with radiolabeled water. Both AA incorporation and blood flow did not differ significantly between the two age groups. Thus, brain energy and lipid metabolism remain intact with healthy human aging (Giovacchini et al 2004) 4. We used our in vivo fatty acid model to image brain arachidonic acid metabolism in an animal model of neuroinflammation (rats in which bacterial lipopolysaccharide was infused into the cerebral ventricles for 6 days). In these rats, arachidonic acid incorporation was elevated in relation to increased brain activities of phospholipase A2 enzymes that release arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipid. These positive results suggest that the fatty acid method can be used to image neuroinflammation diseases like Alzheimer disease, in which postmortem evidences suggest that neuroinflammation occurs. We have published a way to do this with positron emission tomography (PET) and intravenously injected radiolabeled arachidonic acid. (Lee et al 2004; Rosenberger et al 2004)\",\n",

       " \"1. It has been hypothesized lithium may be effective in treating bipolar disorder by reducing brain dopamine signaling. We used our in vivo fatty acid method in unanesthetized rats, to show that it specifically reduced dopamine D2-like receptor signaling coupled to phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation and the release the second messenger, arachidonic acid, from brain membrane phospholipid. (Basselin et al 2005a) 2. With regard to dopamine receptor activation (see #1), We used our fatty acid method in unanesthetized rats to demonstrate that brain D2-like but not D1-like receptors are coupled to phospholipase A2 activation and arachidonic acid release. This is consistent with the literature suggested that D1-like receptors are preferentially coupled to adenylate cyclase activation. We now have a pre-clinical basis for imaging disturbed D2-mediated signal transduction using positron emission tomography, in patients with Parkinson disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. (Bhattacharjee et al 2005). 3. We used our fatty acid method to show that chronic administration of lithium to rats modified signal transduction via post-synaptic serotonergic 5-HT2A 2C receptors, coupled to phospholipase A2 activation and arachidonic acid release. This effect may be related to lithium's ability to ameliorate hallucinations in bipolar disorder. (Basselin et al 2005b) 4. We proposed that drugs used to treat the mania of bipolar disorder - lithium, carbamazepine and valproic acid - selectively target arachidonic acid turnover in brain phospholipid. This proposal was supported by three recent papers. (1) Chronically administered carbamazepine in rats selectively downregulated expression of brain cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2. cPLA2 selectively releases arachidonic acid from brain phospholipids, and cyclooxygenase-2 converts released arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2. (2) Topiramate, suggested for use as a mood stabilizer but since withdrawn, had no effect on these enzymes. (3) Valproic acid, which reduces arachidonic acid turnover in brain phospholipids, did not affect turnover of docosahexaenoic acid, which is susceptible to a non-cPLA2 enzyme. (Ghelardoni et al 2005; Ghelardoni et al 2004) (Bazinet et al 2005) 5. Downregulation of brain cPLA2 expression by chronic lithium administration to rats was associated with decreased expression of the transcription factor AP-2, which regulates cPLA2 transcription. This may represent a primary affect of lithium on the arachidonic acid cascade. (Rao et al In press)\",\n",
       " '1. Studies using positron emission tomography (PET) have reported that global and regional values for cerebral blood flow and metabolic rates for glucose decline with human aging. Using PET to measure brain glucose metabolism in healthy normotensive men of different ages, we determined that, whereas age-declines occurred in measurements uncorrected for atrophy, they were absent after atrophy correction. This argues that healthy human aging is not accompanied by reduced brain glucose metabolism, a marker of local functional activity. (Ibanez et al 2004) 2. We reviewed functional imaging and postmortem data to conclude that brain failure in Alzheimer disease occurs in two stages. The first stage is associated with reduced synaptic efficacy and reduced glucose metabolism, and is potentially reversible. The second stage, in moderate-severe dementia, is associated with neurofibrillary tangle formation, cell death and synaptic dropout, and is irreversible. The brain can be almost normally activated in the first but not the second stage. (Rapoport 2005a) (Rapoport 2005b).',\n",

Subjects with diagnoses of AD had larger changes in immediate memory performance over the six-year interval prior to the estimated onset of their disease than subjects without AD. Six-year longitudinal change in immediate visual memory performance also predicted 6-15 and 16-22 year subsequent cognitive performance, even after adjusting for the influences of age, general ability, and initial immediate memory.

       " \" of work: The neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic underpinnings of age-associated cognitive and memory change remain unclear, as there is little information on longitudinal brain changes in the scientific literature. We are performing annual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and neuropsychological assessments over 9 years in participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), aged 55 and older, to investigate the neurobiological basis of memory change. These evaluations will allow us to examine changes in brain structure and function which may be early predictors of cognitive change and impairment, including Alzheimer's Disease. An understanding of these associations and early detection of brain changes will be critical in identifying individuals likely to benefit from new interventions. In addition, we are using neuroimaging tools to investigate brain changes in response to estrogen and testosterone therapy in older women and men, respectively, from a local retirement community. These recently initiated studies are a follow-up to our observations that estrogen may protect against memory change and Alzheimer's Disease in post-menopausal women. We have examined the effects of age, sex, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype on brain structure measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the first 2 years of the neuroimaging study of BLSA participants. Cross-sectional analyses from 104 participants who completed two annual MRI assessments reveal significantly greater atrophy in older (age 70-85) compared with younger (age 55-69) participants and in men compared with women. Measurements of regional brain volumes show that the effects of age and sex are not uniform across brain regions. Age differences are greatest for the temporal region and smallest for the occipital region. Sex differences are larger for parietal and occipital regions than frontal and temporal regions. The presence of an ApoE 4 allele, a putative risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease, is associated with reduced temporal and parietal brain volumes. Analysis of one-year longitudinal change indicates no detectable one-year change in total or regional brain volumes. In contrast, there is a small but significant increase in ventricular volume over the one-year interval. Associations between these brain changes and cognitive and memory change will be investigated as the longitudinal study progresses. \",\n",

Most research on both pathophysiological disorders such as hypertension and psychopathological disorders such as anxiety and depression has viewed the cardiovascular and autonomic concomitants of these disorders in terms of sympathetic nervous system activity. However, our work based upon solid theoretical and empirical foundations has sought to re-frame the extant literature in terms of a parasympathetic or vagal deficit (Thayer and Lane, 2000). Individuals with these disorders have been shown to have decreased parasympathetic control of the cardiovascular system. This work has helped to clarify the increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with these disorders. Recent work has shown how this re-framing may be instantiated in a computational neural network model of cardiac and emotional regulation. Based upon our previous experimental work we have hypothesized a reciprocal inhibitory cortical-subcortical network associated with autonomic, emotional, and cognitive regulation. We modelled this network with Affective Feature units that were analogous to amygdala activity and Decision Output units that were analogous to activity of the prefrontal cortex. Activity in the Decision units inhibited acivity in the Affective units as an analog to the idea that prefrontal cortex inhibits amygdala activity. Output was modelled as changes in vagally-mediated heart rate variability (HRV). We presented this network with emotionally positive, negative, and neutral inputs and observed the effects on the Affective, Decision, and output units. In response to positive or negative inputs, activity in the Affective Feature units (amygdala) quickly increased and rapidly decayed relative to neutral inputs. Similarly, activity in the Decision units (prefrontal cortex)in response to positive or negative inputs relative to neutral inputs increased after a short delay and then decreased as would be expected in this reciprocal inhibitory network. HRV decreased in response to positive or negative inputs relative to neutral inputs. Importantly when depression was modelled by both over-exposure to negative inputs (as might be the case when people ruminate) and by decreased inhibitory input from the Decision units, activity in the Affective units was increased in response to negative inputs relative to positive or neutral and HRV was concomitantly decreased. Thus this computational network supports our model of neurovisceral integration in which activity in a reciprocal inhibitory cortical-subcortical circuit can be indexed by HRV. Individuals with decreased parasympathetic control of the heart show less ability to adapt both physiologically and psychologically to environmental demands leading to a rigid, inflexible response disposition. Recent studies have extended this model to cognitive processes including working memory. Results indicate that those with higher HRV perform better on tasks that require executive processes and working memory. These findings may guide us as we examine the central and peripheral concomitants of autonomic, emotional, and cognitive regulation.',\n",
       " 'A major component of our research in the Diabetes Section is understanding what controls beta cell mass of the pancreas. With age and type 2 diabetes, there is a failure of expansion of beta cell mass. This is possibly due to increased apoptosis of existing beta cells as well as decreased beta cell neogenesis. We have been investigating the mechanisms of action of GLP-1, a gut hormone, as they relate to insulin release. We found that not only is GLP-1 a potent insulinotropic agent, it upregulates insulin biosynthesis, increases translocation of pdx-1, a transcription factor necessary for maintenance of the beta cell phenotype, to the nucleus and it increases glucokinase protein levels (the essential glucose sensor in beta cells). We also found that it increases beta cell mass by increasing beta cell proliferation in islets of Langerhans. Other investigators demonstrated antiapototic effects of GLP-1 in beta cell lines and whole islets. A GLP-1 receptor agonist, exendin-4, has recently become available for treating type 2 diabetes. A component of our basic work is investigating how GLP-1 increases beta cell turnover. Of relevance to aging, we have found that the ability of GLP-1 receptor agonists to increase beta cell turnover is reduced in islets from old rodents: however, continuous, unremitting treatment of the animals with GLP-1 receptor agonists can overcome this. In addition to defective beta cell function and proliferation, we have found that alpha cells are increased. This led us to speculate that proper beta cell function is needed to control alpha cell function and numbers. Additionally, free fatty levels are increased in aging and type 2 diabetes. We are hypothesizing due to insulin resistance, a unifying hypothesis covering beta cell dysfunction, alpha cell hyperactivity insulin resistance and increased cytokine levels. Eventually, we hope to outline novel therapeutic targets within this concept.',\n",
       " 'A comprehensive examination of basal insulin levels and insulin responses to oral glucose loading has been carried out in 472 men and 299 women aged 20 to 96 years. Men had significantly lower body fat content than women, but higher plasma glucose levels, and a much higher waist hip ratio. Both fasting and past-glucose insulin levels were higher in men, but when adjusted for the sex differences in obesity and glucose levels, this sex difference disappeared. Insulin levels fell progressively with age even when \"corrected\" for differences in body composition and glucose variables, from 323 pM to 267, 253, and 228 in young (20-39 yr) middle-aged, old, and very old (80-96 yr) individuals. Thus the decline in insulin response cannot be attributed to other age-associated changes. In essence, this demonstrates that a defect in insulin secretion occurs in addition to the previously demonstrated defect in insulin sensitivity with aging. Data from the 30 year experience of the BLSA were used to provide the evidence needed to remove the upper age limit from the collaborative clinical trial on prevention of diabetes (conversion of subjects from Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) to WHO-classifiable Diabetes Mellitus. The BLSA data set provides the most extensive experience on Caucasian subjects across the adult span of years. Data provided include: (1) conversion rates as modified by sex, BMI, fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, and family history of diabetes; (2) incidence rates of development of coronary heart disease in IGT; (3) conversion formulae of plasma creatinine levels to 24-hr creatinine clearance for potential dry studies; (4) mortality rates in IGT subjects compared to those with normal glucose tolerance. Data from BLSA participants on incidence of development of diabetes are included in a publication under the auspices of the Diabetes Prevention Program which examines this incidence rate as influenced by age, sex, and race in a summary of the several studies that provide reliable incidence data from various ethnic groups world-wide.

       " \"Anthropometry and cardiovascular risk factors were measured in men and women of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Cross-sectional and longitudinal statistical analyses examined the relationships among body habitus (body composition and fat distribution) and aging, mortality, and selected cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, glucose tolerance, lipid levels). The abdominal sagittal diameter is a simple anthropometric measurement that can be used in population studies. Its use as a surrogate for intra-abdominal fat measurement (by CT or XRI) was suggested from studies conducted by Gothenburg, Sweden scientists. It was therefore used as an index of an individual's central adiposity. SXR was significantly correlated to the risk factors in both younger and older men and women. However the correlations were considerably stronger in the younger subjects. Increasing abdominal sagittal diameter was associated with increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in younger BLSA men ('55 years-but not older men (adjusted for age, height and body mass index). From the findings of this project, it can be concluded that: (1) the abdominal sagittal diabetes is positively correlated to cardiovascular risk factors in men and women; (2) the strength of this relationship decreases with age; (3) and the abdominal sagittal diameter is a strong predictor of mortality in younger adult men, independent of the degree of obesity. \",\n",
       " 'Muscle stretch is a principal determinant of cardiac performance. Lengthening the sarcomere, the basic contractile unit in cardiac muscle, results in enhanced Ca2+-binding to Troponin C and an immediate increase in contractile force in response to the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Cardiac muscle stretch also modulates contraction via enhancement of excitation-Ca2+-release process, but how this occurs remains obscure. We found that myocyte stretch modulates the elementary Ca2+-release process from ryanodine-receptor-Ca2+-release-channels (RyRC), Ca2+-sparks, and the electrically-stimulated Ca2+-transient. Stretch induces PI3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of both Akt and eNOS, NO production, and a proportionate increase in Ca2+-spark frequency that is abolished by inhibiting NOS and PI3-kinase. Exogenously-generated NO reversibly increases Ca2+-spark frequency without cell stretch. We propose that myocyte NO produced by activation of the PI3-kinase-Akt-eNOS axis acts as a second messenger of stretch by enhancing RyRC activity, contributing to myocardial contractile activation. This set of mechanisms could serve as a physiologic sensor of cardiac stretch by generating NO, providing a novel link between cardiac muscle length and EC coupling. This stretch-mediated NO pathway could also be viewed in the larger context of a spectrum of adaptive myocardial load-dependent signalling events involving autocrine paracrine activation of the PI3K-Akt axis diverging to various downstream effectors. The resultant eNOS activation could modulate contractility in the near term but also the induction of genes leading to hypertrophy in the longer term, and promote cell survival. Accordingly, alterations in these mechanisms could contribute to pathological changes in cardiac performance and or structure. For instance, defects in EC coupling due to a reduced ability of ICa to trigger calcium release from the SR in hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure could be correlated with decreases in eNOS protein abundance proportional to the severity of LV dysfunction. Thus, based on the mechanisms identified here, we would propose that the loss of the endogenous NO mechanisms could contribute significantly to the development of functional impairments of cardiac muscle when other compensatory mechanisms fail.',\n",
       " 'Although normative aging is accompanied by increases in arterial stiffness,the relationship between stiffness and cardiac structure and function is not known. The ultimate goals of this project are to determine how arterial stiffness properties influence myocardial structure and function and predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Several sub-projects are described below.A.To determine whether arterial stiffness per se exerts an independent influence on left ventricular (LV) mass,we derived LV mass index (LVMI) from echocardiograms and arterial stiffness from pulse wave velocity (PWV) and applanation tonometry-derived augmentation index (AGI) in 133 normentensive BLSA subjects age 23-87 yrs. Age-associated increases were seen in LVMI (r=0.24), systolic blood pressure(SBP, r=0.31), PWV (r=0.66) and AGI (r=0.53).By multiple regression analysis, AGI (p=.004), SBP (p<.03) and male sex (p=.04) but not age or PWV were independent predictors of greater LVMI.B.To test whether the blunted LV emptying and LV ejection fraction(LVEF) response to exercise in older versus younger subjectscan be ameliorated by reducing central arterial stiffness,we performed maximal upright cycle exercise in 9 healthy subjects 64-82 years old and 8 subjects <40 years old before and after adminstering the vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (N) intravenously.N reduced LV end systolic volume (ESV) and increased LVEF at peak effort in these older subjects, eliminating age differences in these variables noted prior to N.C.We will test the hypothesis that several months of home-based aerobic exercise training can reduce arterial stiffness in an NIH-sponsored multicenter trial of 810 individuals 35-75 years old.D.We have recently completed a study examining the effect of age, sodium intake, body composition and physical activity on arterial stiffness and LV mass in 2 populations in Taiwan.(Cf Contract #N01-AG-02-2118)E.A multicenter study to determine whether arterial stiffness is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events in elderly free-living persons is being developed by the Epidemiology Demography Biometry Program of the intramural NIA.F.A method for calculation of charteristic impedance of the arterial tree from non-invasive measurements of central arterial pressure and flow has recently been developed.

       " 'The aging myocardium expresses many gene transcripts that are normally expressed during embryonic and fetal development. Using transcriptome-based and promoter-based techniques, we have worked towards understanding the mechanisms underlying this control of gene expression both in models of development and in aging. Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) yields a quantitative, representative and comprehensive differential gene expression profile. We have employed SAGE analysis to generate a quantitative transcript assessment that has proven to be much more rapid and economical than other techniques. We used an RT-PCR based technique to determine the time points where a number of mesodermal and cardiac-restricted gene products are expressed in in vitro differentiated EC derived cardiomyocytes. Results show that the earliest contractions occur on Day 5.5 of differentiation (3+2.5 or 4+1.5). Some contractile protein genes (beta MHC) are expressed before the third day of differentiation, but we show that a clear induction of expression of alpha MHC and MLC2V starts relatively later (5+0.5 and 3+1 for alpha MHC and MLC2V respectively). GATA-4, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of cardiac contractile protein gene expression is highly present in the earliest stages of differentiation, and from 3+1.5 days of differentiation, its expression is reduced to the level of adult heart tissue. This indicates that this time period corresponds to an early stage of cardiac differentiation. We have used the protocols of SAGE (and microarrays) to analyze expressed sequence profiles during these time periods. A total of 150,354 tags have been sequenced from three P19 EC cell-based libraries (undifferentiated P19 cells, differentiation Days 3+0.5 and 3+3.0). Ten percent of the 43,432 unique tags matched sequences in the NR GenBank database, while more than 30% of the unique tags did not match any known mouse sequence. Temporally-restricted induction or repression of transcripts at each differentiation stage examined was a common feature of the developmental profiles, suggesting that differentiation-specific processes are necessary for pre- and early cardiac development. Analysis of the normalized tag frequency with differentiation revealed significant changes (p<0.01) in expression of 357 gene products, some of which we now know to also be altered in aging mouse myocardium (microarray-based analyses). We have also utilized quantitative PCR and in situ hybridizations to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution of a number of the most differentially regulated transcripts identified by SAGE, several of which have shown a cardiac predominance in either fetal or adult heart. The novel gene products identified in this study provide a framework for the analysis of pre- and early cardiac developmental processes in human and mouse embryonic stem cells and are the subject of active investigation. Two promoter regions that control the expression of genes important to cardiac function (Na Ca exchanger and the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca ATPase, SERC) have also been analysed. We have shown that an upstream portion of the multipartitite Na Ca exchanger promoter is regulated at least in part by GATA-4 and GATA-6 transcription factors, which may control, at least in part, the expression of the Na Ca exchanger both during development and with aging. Recently we also demonstrated the critical role of SP1 factors in the regulation of the human SERCA2 gene promoter in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The control of this promoter depends on the binding of these factors to specific cis-elements located in the promimal promoter.',\n",
       " 'An important player in the calcium induced calcium release process is the \"cardiac\" ryanodine receptor, RyR2. This is a large protein (500 kD) which forms a tetrameric channel 30x30x15 nm in size. The trans-membrane channel is believed to be formed by the C-terminal. Using standard approaches, we have created and examined ES cells lacking RyR2 to show that this protein is critical in the regulation of heart rate during development. RyR2 null mice produce an embryonic-lethal phenotype by 10 dpc. Functional studies are on-going to determine the reason for the lethality, as it does not appear to be linked to a \\'classic\\' EC coupling mechanism. We have also established a tripartite mouse model system to study the in-vivo function of this channel using a transgenic approach to produce an inducible, tissue-restricted null background by in adult mice hearts. To avoid embryonic lethality, we prepared several transgenic lines that would permit conditional and inducible gene targeting, limited to specific cardiac lineages (e.g. ventricular myocytes) and inducible at a desired developmental stage (particularly in the adult). The tools to accomplish this were the Cre recombinase - LoxP recombination system and the tetracycline trans-activator system. The mutant mice containing the RyR2 targeting vector have been crossed with the regulatory transgenic mice to permit regulated knock-out of the transgene in the adult mouse; however, the animals show incomplete penetrance. Their phenotype, both of individual cardiac myocytes and at a whole animal level, will be examined to determine the essential role of the RyR2 protein on EC coupling. Ultimately, rescue of the null-phenotype will be achieved through targeting of the floxed sequences with chimeric cDNA constructs to permit the endogenous transcriptional machinery of the RyR2 to transcribe mutant forms of the protein. Proof of this system has already been generated in ES cells null for the RyR2 gene, and we will exploit this system to generate transgenic mice with mutant forms of the ryanodine receptor to study specific questions related to the structure and function of the RyR2 protein.',\n",
       " 'There are, at least, two splicing variants of CaMKII-d, dB and dC, located in unclear and cytosol compartments, respectively. Our present in vivo and in vitro studies have provided multiple lines of evidence to demonstrate that CaMKII-dB and CaMKII-dC exhibit opposing functional roles in regulating cardiomyocyte viability with CaMKII-dB protective and CaMKII-dC apoptotic. (1) CaMKII Activation Is Required for b1AR-Induced Apoptosis in Cardiomyocytes and In Vivo. Sustained b1AR stimulation markedly increased CaMKII activity in a time-dependent manner in adult mouse cardiomyocytes; this effect was abolished by a specific CaMKII inhibitors AIP or KN93 but not by specific PKA inhibitors Zhu et al.,J. Clin. Invest. 111:617-625, (2003). Importantly, inhibition of CaMKII fully protected myocytes from b1AR-induced apoptosis. In collaboration with Mark Anderson, we further demonstrated that CaMKII was essential for in vivo apoptotic response to excessive catecholamine stimulation Yang et al., Am. J. Physiol. 291:H3065-H3075, (2006). (2) Increased CaMKII-dC Activity Is Sufficient to Cause Heart Muscle Cell Apoptosis. We specifically enhanced or inhibited CaMKII-dC activity by adenoviral gene transfer of a constitutively active (CA- CaMKII-dC) or a dominant negative CaMKII-dC mutant (DN-CaMKIIdC), respectively. Enforced expression of CA-CaMKII-dC alone caused increased cardiac myocyte apoptosis. The severity of cell apoptosis was closely correlated with CA-CaMKII-dC protein abundance and the kinase activity, suggesting there is a causal relation between activation of CaMKII-dC and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. (3) Activation of Endogenous CaMKII by Various Stimuli That Trigger Myocyte Apoptosis Multiple cell death-inducing stimuli, such as increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, acidosis, and oxidative stress, increased endogenous CaMKII activity by 23-fold over baseline. These stimuli markedly triggered myocyte apoptosis in CaMKII inhibitors sensitive manner. To define the relative contributions of CaMKII-dC versus that of CaMKII-dB to the observed cell death, we suppressed CaMKII-dC activity using the DN-CaMKII-dC, and found that expression of DN-CaMKII-dC inhibited the kinase activity and the associated cell death. These results indicate that activation of CaMKII-dC constitutes a common pathway converging multiple stimuli evoked apoptotic signals in cardiomyocytes Zhu et al., J. Biol. Chem. 282:10833-10839, (2007). (4) CaMKII-dB Protects Cardiomyocytes Against Apoptosis. CaMKII-dB expression is remarkably attenuated at both mRNA and protein levels in rat ischemia reperfusion (I R) and myocardium infarction (MI) models and in cultured cardiomyocytes subjected to oxidative stress with H2O2. The inhibitory effects of MI and H2O2 on CaMKII-dB are fully prevented by ROS scavengers, indicating ROS constitutes a negative regulator of CaMKII-dB gene expression. Concurrently, MI and H2O2 markedly increase myocyte apoptosis in vivo and in culture, respectively, assayed by Hoechst or TUNEL staining and caspase activation. Most importantly, overexpression of CaMKII-dB using adenoviral gene transfer protects heart cells against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, assayed by DNA laddering and PI staining. The CaMKII-dB protective effect is mediated by an HSP70-mediated signaling pathway. Based on the opposing effects of these cardiac CaMKII isoforms, we envision that a combination of activation of CaMKII-dB with inhibition of CaMKII-dC should be superior to isoform-nonselective inhibition of CaMKII as a potential therapy for the treatment of heart failure or cardiac arrhythmia.',\n",
       " 'The Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science has a strong commitment to the study of aging myocardium. To identify gene products in heart potentially involved in aging, functional genomic analyses (cDNA microarrays and Serial Analysis of Gene Expression) have been employed to analyze mRNA from left ventricles of Fisher 344 rats with or without caloric restriction, Wistar rats, C57Bl 6 mice during the perinatal period and with aging, CBA mice treated with biopeptides implicated in gerontoprotection, and human biopsies from failing and non-failing myocardium. The aim of these projects are to determine which gene products are regulated as a function of age or disease, and then use independent methods to determine the underlying mechanisms responsible for the altered changes in gene expression. In 2002, we published a reference dataset (SAGE analysis) of the mouse myocardium that is publicly available, and we have expanded these studies to examine male versus female mice and young versus old mice. We have completed a large-scale transcriptome analysis of an aging Fisher 344 aging rat model and compared these results with other rodent strains. We are completing an extensive quantitative-PCR analysis to validate these data, and by independent techniques, to determine the significance of the changes in gene expression with the aging process. We have expanded our aging studies in rodent to include in vitro analyses of cultured cardiomyoyctes and fibroblasts to delineate mechanisms underlying the aging response of cardiac genes, and are in the process of elucidating genetic correlates underlying these changes in transcript abundance. Finally, we have employed functional genomic techniques (microarrays) to examine the transcriptomes of LVs from failing (n=8) and non-failing human myocardium (n=7). Following identification of a pool of HF-responsive candidate genes by microarrays and statistical methods, we employed Q-PCR on a larger sample population (n=34) to validate and examine the role of contributing biological variables (age and gender). We find that most of the HF-candidate genes (including transcription factors, modifying enzymes, ECM proteins and metabolic enzymes) demonstrated significant changes in gene expression; however, the majority of the putative changes depended on variables such as sex and age, and not on HF alone. Additionally, some putative HF-responsive gene products demonstrated highly significant changes in expression as a function of age and or sex, but independent of HF. These studies with human samples have now expanded to include hypertension, and we have begun a meta analysis of human heart failure data. The data from each of these projects are being compared in an effort to identify and analyze the function of candidate genes in aging and disease.',\n",

Age and sex related differences hormones, nutritional and physiological variables involved in bone turnover are important in elucidating changes in bone physiology in normal aging and disease. Specifically, the relationship age and sex to changes in body composition, both as a marker of obesity and as a measure of the weight bearing load on bone are important factors in bone status and rates of change. The most dramatic rates of change in bone mass occur at the menopause, and changes of body composition, bone mass, and bone markers and hormones are being investigated in a cohort of peri-menopausal women recruited to the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, who will be followed at 3 month intervals as they traverse the menopause. These studies will allow for the interpretation of the changes that occur prior to and immediately around the time of the cessation of menses, changes that can only be appreciated in a prospective longitudinal study.

       " 'Cav1.2 calcium channels are critical for controlling cardiac excitability and excitationcontraction coupling in the heart, while their malfunctions lead cardiac diseases. Cav beta-subunits are powerful natural modulators of the channel. Investigation of molecular correlates of beta-subunit modulation of the channel is crucial from the pharmacological standpoint because it holds promise of new avenues in drug discovery. From the C-tail of the major human cardiac beta2 subunit we have derived a previously unknown 41-amino acid peptide, which stimulates the channel activity, and identified its targeted structure in the channel. Results of this study are used now to engineer the interacting peptides with an aim to reveal structural principles of new potential beta-subunit-based drug(s). Another important regulator of Cav1.2 calcium channels is the calcium-sensing signaling peptide calmodulin. It plays a crucial role in negative feedback regulation of the channel activity preventing highly toxic calcium overload of cardiac cells during action potential. We have discovered the ability of calmodulin to modulate calcium channel expression and activity in a specific way in the absence of beta subunits. Results of this study open new perspectives for a genetically encoded correction of impaired channel functions in cardiovascular diseases. Using laser-capture microdissection of immunohistochemically-identified atrial and ventricular cells from explanted (dilated cardiomyopathy) and rejected for transplantation normal live hearts, we have identified human cardiac genes that are significantly affected by cardiomyopathy in the atrium (12 genes) and left ventricle (4 genes). Our study revealed new unexpected targets that will facilitate drug discovery to combat this major cardiac disease. Also completed is the study of the effects of three major beta-subunits on the distances between and within the proteins composing calcium channels in their natural clusters. The arrangement of these molecules is estimated with a sub-nanometer precision using, for the first time, the three-color FRET microscopy technique and mathematical procedures developed in the lab. This study revealed an important property of human beta subunits to direct the arrangement of the channel clusters in a vascular and cardiac manner, which could explain, in part, the differences in vascular and cardiac EC-coupling.',\n",

       " '1. Alzheimers Disease: Three series of agents are being developed to treat AD. Selective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) production. 1.1. Cholinesterase inhibitors: Compounds were developed to optimally augment the cholinergic system in the elderly and raise levels of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh). Extensive studies involving chemistry, X-ray crystallography, biochemistry and pharmacology resulted in the design and synthesis of novel compounds to differentially inhibit either AChE or BChE in either the brain or periphery for an optimal duration for the potential treatment of a variety of diseases, such as AD, Myasthenia Gravis, and as chemical warfare prophylactics (collaborators: Drs. Brossi, Lahiri, Kulkarni, Sambamurti). In addition, specific and highly selective BChE inhibitors have been designed to characterize the role of this enzyme in brain during health, aging and disease. 1.1A. AChE: Two of our numerous novel synthesized AChE inhibitors are in development for the treatment of AD; specifically, the pure non-competitive inhibitors, phenserine and tolserine. Both are phenylcarbamates of physostigmine that are 70- and 190-fold selective for AChE vs. BChE. They have a favorable toxicologic profile and robustly enhance cognition in animal models (collaborator Dr. Ingram). They possess a long duration of reversible enzyme inhibition, coupled with a short pharmacokinetic half-life. This reduces dosing frequency, decreases body drug exposure and minimizes the dependence of drug action on the individual variations of drug metabolism commonly found in the elderly. In collaboration with industry, phenserine translated from the laboratory and into clinical trials where actions on cognition and levels of CSF and plasma Abeta have been assessed in mild to moderate AD (collaborators: Drs. Bruinsma, Sambamurti, Lahiri). In parallel studies in collaboration with Dr. Utsuki (LSU), Dr. Irie (Kumomoto Univ., Japan) a transdermal patch has been developed to maintain steady-state optimal drug levels and maximize dosing compliance. 1.1B. BChE: In normal brain, some 80% of cholinesterase activity is in the form of AChE and 20% is BChE. AChE activity is concentrated mainly in neurons, while BChE is primarily associated with glial cells. Kinetic evidence indicates a role for BChE, in hydrolysing excess ACh. In advanced AD, however, AChE activity decreases to 15% of normal levels in affected brain regions, whereas BChE activity increases. The normal ratio of BChE to AChE becomes mismatched in AD causing excess metabolism of already depleted levels of ACh. The first available reversible and highly potent BChE inhibitors have been synthesized and are in preclinical assessment to evaluate their potential as AD drug candidates. On going studies are focusing on cognition and the molecular mechanisms underpinning AD with a focus to advance a BChE inhibitor to clinic assessment. The selective BChE inhibitor, (-)-bisnorcymserine, has been chosen and is advancing through required preclinical studies. Additional studies are utilizing these valuable agents to define the role of BChE in brain in health, aging and disease 1.2. Molecular events associated with AD: The reduction in levels of the potentially toxic amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has emerged as an important therapeutic goal in AD. Key targets for this goal are factors that affect the expression and processing of the Abeta precursor protein (APP). Our studies show that phenserine, reduces APP and Abeta levels in vivo and in tissue culture without toxicity. This activity is independent of its cholinesterase action, but is post-transcriptional: lowering APP protein levels without affecting mRNA levels. This is mediated in part via the 5-untranslated region (UTR) of APP mRNA. Current studies are characterizing mechanisms involved and focusing on these in the design and synthesis of agents that lower APP levels as a way of lower Abeta peptide (collaborators: Drs. Lahiri, Sambamurti, Rogers, Giordano, Utsuki). The compound, posiphen, has advanced to clinical trials and backup compounds are being assessed to undertsand molecular mechanisms underpinning activity. A series of new compounds has been designed that combine actions on Abeta with those on AChE or BChE at the same optimal concentration 2. Stroke, Parkinsons disease (PD), brain trauma: Drugs currently used provide temporary relief of symptoms, but do not prevent the cell death. Our target for drug design is the transcription factor, p53. Its up-regulation is a common feature of several neurodegenerative disorders, and is a gate keeper to the biochemical cascade that leads to apoptosis (programmed cell death). We recently designed and synthesized a novel series of tetrahydrobenzothiazole and oxazole analogues that inhibit p53 activity. Compounds are in current assessment for neuroprotective action in tissue culture and animal models (collaborators: Drs. Mattson, Ovadia, Pick, Hoffer, Wang) to select agents of potential for evaluation as drug candidates. Compounds of this calss have demonstrated biological activity in cellular andor animal models of stroke, AD and PD, thet are being assessed in other neurodegenerative diseases to define their optimal use. 3. Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is a prevalent disease in the elderly. Present treatments are unsatisfactory. Our target for drug design is the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (R). GLP-1 is secreted from the gut in response to food and is a potent secretagogue it binds to the GLP-1R on pancreatic beta-cells to induce glucose-dependent insulin secretion, thereby controling plasma glucose levels. We are developing long-acting GLP-1 analogues (collaborators: Drs. Egan, Mattson). This research aided in the development of the peptide exendin-4 (Ex-4) into clinical studies in type 2 diabetes. Novel chimeric peptides that combine the best features of GLP-1 and Ex-4 have also been designed and are under preclinical assessment in a variety models. We are characterizing the role of the GLP-1R stimulation in the nervous system, as it is found present in brain and peripheral nerve. GLP-1 analogues possess neurotrophic properties and protect neuronal cells from oxidative and Abeta-induced cell death. Neuroprotection in cell culture translated to in vivo studies in classical rodent neurodegeneration models, which include AD and peripheral neuropathy (collaborator: Dr. Perry). Current studies are focused on selecting agents for clinical assessment. 4. Inflammation: Inflammation is a critical feature of neurodegereation and also occurs in numerous systemic diseases. Our target is the cytokine, TNF-alpha. Novel, potent TNF-alpha inhibitors are being synthesized on the backbone of thalidomide. They reduce TNF-alpha synthesis post-transcriptionally, via its 3-UTR, in cell culture studies. These are being assessed in vivo to define time- and concentration inhibition of TNF-alpa systemically as well as in brain. Upto 90% inhibition can be achieved in either compartment. Classical animals models are be utilized to aid in the selection of a clinical cadidate for chronic diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and PD, as well as acute events such as head trauma (collaborators: Drs. Pick, Hoffer, Wang, Utsuki, Ingram Gabbita).',\n",

We have found that there are abnormalities in lipid metabolism in the brains of patients with AD. Specifically, levels of cholesterol and long-chain ceramides are increased. Studies of experimental animal and cell culture models of AD suggest that increased oxidative stress, associated with amyloid deposition is responsible for the lipid abnormalities. Antioxidants and drugs that prevent the production of ceramides protect neurons from being damaged and killed by amyloid suggesting an important role for the lipid abnormalities in the disease process. Membrane lipid peroxidation appears to play an important role in amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein as the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal covalently modifies the protein nicastrin and thereby increases gamma-secretase activity. In other studies we have identified a novel protein called Herp (homocysteine responsive endoplasmic reticulum protein) that can protect neurons from being damaged and killed by amyloid and a presenilin mutation. In addition, we have found that dietary restriction can reduce amyloid deposition and protect neurons from being damaged and killed in animal models of AD, and that this beneficial effect of dietary restriction involves stimulation of the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Antidepressant serotonin reuptake inhibitors can reduce amyloid deposition and improve cognitive function in a mouse model of AD, suggesting a potential prophylactic therapeutic use of such drugs.\",\n",
       " \"In neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, neurons may die by a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. A major effort in the Cellular and Molecular Neurosciences section of the Laboratory of Neurosciences is aimed at establishing what triggers apoptosis in neurodegenerative disorders and how neuronal degeneration might be prevented by targeting specific molecular events in the process of apoptosis. We have found that a protein called p53 is involved in the death of neurons in experimental models of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Novel specific inhibitors of p53 were developed and several lead agents were shown to be effective in animal models of stroke and Parkinson's disease. In other studies we established important roles for potassium ion fluxes in the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration in models of stroke. A drug called diazoxide that opens mitochondrial potassium channels was neuronprotective in models of stroke. In studies of the mechanism by which neurons die in Alzheimer's disease we have found that damage to DNA causes the neurons to undergo an abortive attempt to re-enter the cell cycle resulting in activation of the ATM kinase and p53 which trigger apoptosis. Our studies of telomere function in neurons have revealed roles for several telomere-associated proteins in preventing apoptosis. Damage to mitochondrial DNA may also trigger apoptosis, but a DNA repair protein called OGG1 can protect neurons from dying in models of neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, we have identified a mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP4) that can protect neurons in models relevant to stroke and Alzheimer's disease by a mechanism involving suppression of oxidative stress and stabilization of cellular calcium homeostasis. We have also established roles for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in preventing the apoptosis of neurons produced from stem cells in the hippocampus, a finding that suggests the possibility of increasing the capacity of the brain to replace lost and damaged neurons.\",\n",
       " \"We have identified several growth factors and cytokines that can protect neurons against dysfunction and death in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke. These trophic factors activate signaling pathways that stimulate the expression of genes whose encoded proteins increase resistance of neurons to oxidative and metabolic stress. Neuroprotective Actions of BDNF. We have found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key mediator of the neuroprotective effects of dietary restriction in animal models of Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. BDNF protects neurons against excitotoxic and oxidative insults. In addition, we found that BDNF promotes neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and mediates the enhancement of neurogenesis by dietary restriction. BDNF activates a positive feedback loop for the regulation of neurogenesis by inducing the production of nitric oxide by newly generated neurons. The nitric oxide then acts on neural progenitor cells to induce their differentiation into neurons. In other studies we have found that caloric restriction reduces damage to dopaminergic neurons and improves functional outcome in a non-human primate model of Parkinson's disease. The beneficial effect of CR is associated with increased amounts of BDNF and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a growth factor which is now in early clinical trials in patients with Parkinson's disease. In related studies we have found that the antidepressant paroxetine can suppress neuronal degeneration and improve motor function and survival in a mouse model of Hungtington's disease by a mechanism involving increased production of BDNF. In addition, we have identified GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) as a neuroprotective neuropeptide with the potential to ameliorate neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in some neurodegenerative conditions.\",\n",
       " \"In previous studies we had shown that intermittent fasting (IF) is neuroprotective in rodent models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and stroke. The neuroprotective mechanism involves induction of a mild beneficial cellular response as indicated by increased expression of heat-shock proteins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We have found that IF increases BDNF levels in the brain, ameliorates diabetes, suppresses neuronal degeneration in the striatum and cortex, and extends survival in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. In a more recent study we have shown that dietary restriction is beneficial in a monkey model of Parkinson's disease. Monkeys that had been maintained on a reduce calorie diet exhibited increased resistance of their dopaminergic neurons to the parkinsonian neurotoxin MPTP and improved functional outcome. Levels of BDNF and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor were increased in the striatum of the monkeys on the calorie restricted diet, suggesting a role for these neurotrophic factors in the beneficial effects of caloric restriction. We have recently provided evidence that dietary lipids may modulate risk of AD and ALS. Levels of cholesterol and long-chain ceramides are increased in membranes of cells in the brains of AD patients and spinal cords of ALS patients. Additional data in studies of cell culture and animal models of AD and ALS suggest that ceramides may play an important role in the cell death process in these disorders. Because levels of cholesterol, sphingolipids and ceramides can be modulated by changes in diet, our data suggest that dietary lipids may modify the vulnerability of neurons to age-related diseases. In other studies we have shown that IF can improve glucose metabolism (increased insulin sensitivity) and cardiovascular risk factors (decreased blood pressure and superior cardiovascular stress adaptation) in rats. The latter effects of IF were mimicked by intermittent feeding of rats a diet supplemented with 2-deoxyglucoe, a non-metabolizable analog of glucose. Interestingly, IF and caloric restriction also increase heart rate variability in a manner suggesting that these diets increase parasympathetic tone, while decreasing sympathetic tone. Thus, IF and caloric restriction exert physiological actions that would be expected to reduce the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\",\n",
       " \"The ability of synapses to change their properties in response to environmental demands (synaptic plasticity) is essential for learning and memory. Abnormalities in synaptic plasticity are involved in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. In our continuing efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in synaptic plasticity, in the contexts of aging and neurodegenerative disorders, we have made two major advances. 1) During development of the nervous system, the fate of stem cells is regulated by a cell surface receptor called Notch. Notch is also present in the adult mammalian brain; however, because Notch null mice die during embryonic development, it has proven difficult to determine the functions of Notch. Here, we used Notch antisense transgenic mice that develop and reproduce normally, but exhibit reduced levels of Notch, to demonstrate a role for Notch signaling in synaptic plasticity. Mice with reduced Notch levels exhibit impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal CA1 synapses. A Notch ligand enhances LTP in normal mice and corrects the defect in LTP in Notch antisense transgenic mice. Levels of basal and stimulation-induced NF-kappa B activity were significantly decreased in mice with reduced Notch levels. These findings suggest an important role for Notch signaling in a form of synaptic plasticity known to be associated with learning and memory processes. 2) Although ATP is reported to modulate synaptic plasticity, the mechanism of action of ATP on synaptic transmission is not fully understood. Here we show that ATP enhances long-term potentiation (LTP), and P2X receptor antagonists inhibit this ATP effect, but do not affect paired pulse facilitation (PPF) in rat hippocampal slices. ATP rapidly increases intracellular calcium, and P2X receptor antagonists inhibit this increase in cultured dissociated neurons. These results indicate that ATP enhances LTP via activation of postsynaptic P2X receptors. A pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein inhibitor significantly attenuates PPF, although it does not affect LTP, indicating that presynaptic P2Y receptors also play an important role in neuronal plasticity. We conclude that ATP modulates synaptic plasticity via dual effects on pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms.\",\n",
       " \"1. AUGMENTATION OF TISSUE GROWTH ANABOLIC EFFECTS OF ULTRASOUND ON CHONDROCYTES AND CARTILAGE Chondrocyte and cartilage explant studies: Pulsed low intensity ultrasound (PLIUS) was applied to chondrocytes. The effect on cell proliferation and on expression of mRNA for collagen II, collagen X, Sox9, and aggrecan was followed for a period of one week in addition to immunostaining. Anabolic effects of PLIUS were documented; similar results were obtained upon application of PLIUS to chick sternal explants. Animal model study: The Hartley guinea pig model of spontaneous age-associated OA was used to test the efficacy of PLIUS. Groups representing early intervention and treatment of established disease were studied. Histologic evaluation was performed using a modified Mankin scale. PLIUS applied to the knee joint of both young and older animals was found to attenuate the development of OA. 2. ASSESSMENT OF CARTILAGE FT-IRIS CARTILAGE EVALUATION, with Dr. Nancy Pleshko Study of Avian-derived HFBR Tissue We hypothesized that PG content and distribution in tissue engineered cartilage could be determined using Fourier transform infrared imaging spectroscopy (FTIRIS). After 4 weeks of cultur, bioreactor cartilage was sectioned. FTIRIS, histology, and biochemical analyses were performed. We found greater PG absorbance for regions near the tissue culture medium inflow and near the center of the HFBR. Correlations with biochemical assays were also established. We found that we could evaluate developing cartilage at the molecular level, demonstrating that FTIRIS determination of PG correlates with histological determination and biochemical analysis. FT-IRIS and MR Microscopy in a Rabbit Model of OA FT-IRIS and selected comparisons with corresponding MR microscopy were undertaken to evaluate articular cartilage in surgically induced osteoarthritic cartilage in the rabbit. FT-IRIS studies of femoral condyle cartilage revealed that the OA cartilage had significantly reduced PG content 2 and 4 weeks post-surgery, collagen fibril orientation changes 2 and 4 weeks post-surgery, and changes in collagen integrity 2 and 10 weeks post-surgery, but no significant changes in collagen content at any time. MR microscopy studies revealed reduced PG content in the OA cartilage 4 weeks post-surgery. A rend toward higher apparent MT exchange rate, km, was also found in the OA cartilage, suggesting changes in collagen structural features. The MR findings for PG and km paralleled the FT-IRIS findings of reduced PG content and altered collagen integrity, respectively. MR studies 12-weeks after surgery also found a trend toward longer T2 values and reduced anisotropy in the deep zone of the OA cartilage, consistent with increased hydration and less ordered collagen. These FT-IRIS and MR microscopy findings highlight the complementary nature of the two techniques. Statistical Comparison of FTIR Spectra FTIR spectra are sensitive to subtle changes in matrix composition of cartilage. However, statistical comparison of two seemingly different spectra from a given sample is required to determine whether apparent spectral differences arise from true changes in the sample, such as degradation, or can be attributed to noise. We addressed this problem with respect to NMR spectra some time ago, and have now performed comparable analyses for the double-beam transmittance and absorbance spectra typically used for characterization of biological tissue. The approach is based upon the fact that typical FTIR spectra are acquired using signal averaging. For the standard deviation of the ratio of spectral band amplitudes in single-scan absorbance spectra in terms of quantities that are observable from the signal-averaged spectrum, we find, after a rather lengthy calculation, a remarkably simple result which permits statistical comparison of absorbance band ratios. IMPROVEMENT IN SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF MRI CHARACTERIZATION OF CARTILAGE We tested the hypothesis that MT and T2 values in cartilage may depend upon collagen crosslinking status at constant collagen concentration. We used formalin as an agent which is well-known to cross-link tissue proteins. Samples of bovine nasal cartilage were studied prior to fixation, after 9 weeks immersion in formalin solutions at three formaldehyde concentrations and after NaBH3CN reduction and washing. Apparent MT rate increased by 25.93.7% and 52.87.1% over baseline under these conditions, while T2 decreased by 59.41.1% upon fixation in 10% formalin and was 32.25.2% shorter than initial values after washing. Biochemical assays showed no significant differences in water content, proteoglycan, natural crosslink or collagen content between 0% and 10% formalin-treated samples. We conclude that formalin fixation of cartilage results in significant decreases in T2 and increases in MT parameters which persist after removal of unreacted formaldehyde. The new collagen crosslinks thus created are associated with large changes to MT and T2, indicating that interpretation of MT and T2 values in cartilage must be made with caution; these parameters depend upon collagen crosslinking status in addition to collagen content. 3. PERIARTICULAR STUDIES: MUSCLE The effects on periarticular musculature of injection into the knee joint of the rat Bioenergetic reserve in the quadriceps muscle of the rat in response to intraarticular injection of saline (SAL group), papain (papain-induced arthritis; PIA), and sham injection (SHAM) was compared to that of control animals. The degree of cartilage damage was assessed using histology. The three groups that underwent joint invasion exhibited a decreased rate of NMR-determined metabolic bioenergetic recovery as compared to control animals, but did not differ significantly among themselves. Functionally, the bioenergetic deficit seen in the intervention groups corresponded to decreased ability of the quadriceps muscle to maintain force during 8 minutes of muscle stimulation. Finally, measurements of intramuscular IL-1 and IL-6 indicated that invasion of the joint resulted in inflammation of the quadriceps muscles, including those of the sham&#61485;operated animals, but especially in the SAL and PIA groups. This indicates that invasion of the knee joint results in pathologic changes in periarticular muscle. Development of an improved method to determine chemical exchange rates in muscle We have developed a new method for measuring spin-lattice relaxation times and chemical exchange rate constants in multiple-site exchanging systems. CUPS, for chemical exchange and T1 measurement using progressive saturation, was applied to determine T1's and to analyze exchange among phosphocreatine (PCr), ATP, and inorganic phosphate (Pi), mediated by creatine kinase and ATP synthase, using 31P-MRS. 2-site exchange was analyzed in vitro and in the rat leg, and 3-site exchange was analyzed in the rat heart. The method avoids the use of selective irradiation and complex pulse timings or shapes, resulting in lack of RF-related artifacts and experimental simplicity. The analysis is based on a model that describes the observed magnetization of a chemically exchanging resonance subjected to the one-pulse sequence. It is these curves which are simultaneously fit to the mode. For the in vitro system at 8.45 T, we found T1(PCr)=2.86 s and T1(&#61543;-ATP)=1.72 s. For the rat gastrocnemius at 1.9 T, we found T1(PCr)=6.60 s and T1(&#61543;-ATP)=2.06 s. For the rat heart at 9.4 T, we found T1(PCr)=3.35 s, T1(&#61543;-ATP)=0.69 s, and T1(Pi)=1.83 s. All derived T1 values were within 20% of literature values. Similarly, exchange rates were in the same range as published values.\",\n",
       " 'Despite the extensive documentation on HIV-1 infectivity, replication within target cells, mechanism(s) of viral immunopathogenesis, and the development of AIDS in adults, no specific cellular- and or molecular-based studies have been published to date examining any differential infectivity or propagation of HIV-1 within immune cells derived from elderly subjects or within HIV-1-infected elderly patients. Results from our laboratory have demonstrated significant differences in viral growth between young and aged human and primate mononuclear cells. Increased titers of virus were observed in HIV-1-infected aged mononuclear cells and lymphocytes compared to virally infected cells from younger donors. We believe that aged lymphocytes may be less susceptible to HIV-1-mediated cell death and may serve as a reservoir promoting virion production. Given T cell phenotypic alterations that have been observed in various chronic inflammatory disease states and aging, we believe that a similar systemic Th2 polarization may occur in circulating T cells of elderly subjects making them more susceptible to HIV-1 disease. Based on these findings, we are examining various parameters of HIV-1-mediated signaling, replication and immunopathogenesis using young and aged mononuclear cells and T lymphocytes. Additional studies are being performed examining alterations in the circulating homocysteine, vitamin B12, folate, and red blood cell folate levels in these subjects to determine if there are any age- and HIV-related changes in these subjects and any possible correlations with immune phenotypes and cellular apoptosis. In addition, we have continued our research studying the basic biology of the chemokine co-receptors and the various signaling molecules and raft-associated molecules required for their activity. Finally, we have identified several new and novel chemokine receptor antagonists that block several receptors and are capable of blocking HIV infectivity and binding as well as chemokine function. We believe these antagonists may have potential therapeutic value in the treatment of AIDS. Overall, these studies should provide invaluable information on age-related differences in chemokine biology and HIV-1 infectivity and pathogenesis.',\n",
       " \"The major focus of our work is on the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the role it plays in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We also initiated a study on the regulation of the D2 dopamine receptor gene and its role in Parkinson's Disease, tardive dyskinesia and normal aging. We made three independent mutations within the APP gene (mAPPs) which are known to cause early-onset, familial AD or Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidoses-Dutch Type. Plasmids containing mAPPs were stably transfected into cell lines in order to examine phenotypic consequences to the cells and proteolytic processing of the expressed APPs. Neuronal and endothelial cells expressing mAPPs showed larger C-terminal fragments. NGF cAMP treated PC-12 cells expressing mAPPs showed elevated levels of APP and C-terminal fragments. They had severely compacted cell bodies and eventually detached from the plates and died. We have cloned and characterized the 5' upstream regulatory region of the rat APP gene. A 375 bp fragment from this region functioned as a strong promoter in rat and human cell lines and its activity was enhanced by retinoic acid. The basal promoter activity was localized to a 75 bp sequence by deletional analysis. Finally, we isolated several DNA fragments from the functional promoter of the D2 dopamine receptor gene. Nuclear extracts from different tissues of young and old rats are being used with these promoter fragments to identify possible cis-acting transcriptional regulatory sites. \",\n",
       " ' of Work: A new program has been initiated to study the molecular basis for the decline in T cell function that accompanies aging. Based on the belief that a better understanding of the biochemistry involved in normal T cell activation and function is required in order to identify the precise changes that occur with age, studies have focused on the early membrane-proximal signaling events that occur upon T cell antigen receptor (TCR) activation in standard (non-aged) T cell model systems. An especially interesting TCR-proximal signaling molecule is ZAP-70, which is a protein tyrosine kinase that is expressed only within T cells and NK cells, and is required for T cell activation through the TCR. Of particular interest is the identification of additional signaling molecules that either perpetuate or regulate the activity of ZAP-70. Progress has been made towards this goal by the use of a two-hybrid screening protocol, which has identified four gene products that appear to specifically associate with ZAP-70. The ability of the proteins expressed by these cDNAs to bind ZAP-70 is being evaluated, as is the functional relevance of their association with ZAP-70. T cells isolated from aged animals often show a diminished capacity to cope with oxidative stress. Given observations that certain oxidative stimuli (ultraviolet light and peroxide) are able to recapitulate the signals generated by antigen engagement of the TCR, investigation of the causes of the changes in tolerance towards oxidative stress with age may provide additional insight into the biochemical changes responsible for reduced T cell function with age. By using a T cell line that lacks ZAP-70, we have begun to assess the role played by ZAP-70 in the propagation of stress signals in T cells. Preliminary results show that ZAP-70 is required in order to see activation of MAP kinases in response to oxidative stimuli. ',\n",
       " ' of work: This project focusses on the signal transduction pathways mediating stress responses in mammalian cells. Studies over the past year have concentrated on three topics. (1) Identification of upstream regulators of ERK signaling in response to arsenite. We have previously demonstrated that arsenite can differentially activate ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases. The activation of ERK is dependent on Ras. Now we have found that arsenite can stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its interaction with the adaptor protein Grb2. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was concommitant with tyrosine phosphorylation of an unidentified high molecular weight protein, with which it interacts. This protein may function as an activator of Shc during stress, initiating the Ras ERK signaling cascade. (2) p90RSK activation in response to stress and its relationship with IkB. p90RSK is a serine threonine protein kinase which lies downstream of ERK, and is therefore activated by mitogenic stimuli. We found that p90RSK can be activated by many stressful conditions including arsenite, H2O2 and methyl methanesulfonate. p90RSK activation was found to correlate with the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB, an inhibitor of the transcription factor NF-kB. p90RSK may function as an IkB kinase and contribute to NF-kB activation during stress. (3) Age-associated decline in p70S6k in EGF-stimulated hepatocytes. Aging is associated with a decline in the proliferative capacity of cells. Previously we showed that this was correlated with decreased ERK activation by mitogenic stimuli. We have now observed that there is also a significant decline in the activity of p70S6k with aging. Thus, defects in at least two distinct signal transduction pathways may account for the age-associated defect in proliferative capacity. Analysis of the upstream regulators common to both pathways may provide important insights into the basic mechanisms of the aging. ',\n",
       " 'In response to external and internal signals, mammalian cells elicit changes in gene expression patterns that profoundly influence the global cellular response. The transcriptional events that regulate gene expression changes have been thoroughly studied, but less-well understood post-transcriptional processes are emerging as major regulatory mechanisms. Post-transcriptional gene regulation includes pre-mRNA processing and maturation, mRNA transport, stability and translation, as well as protein processing, modification and degradation. We are keenly interested in investigating the mechanisms that regulate the expression of proliferative, cell cycle-regulatory, and stress-response proteins. Over the past 10 years, this Project has examined mRNAs encoding various stress-response and proliferative proteins. During this funding period, we have focused our attention on mRNAs encoding the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 and the MAP Kinase phosphatase (MKP)-1. We have reported that RBPs HuR and PTB associate with HIF-1 mRNA and promote its translation in response to treatment with hypoxia and with the hypoxia mimetic CoCl2. We also reported that the post-transcriptional regulation of MKP-1 expression is mediated by HuR and NF90; both RBPs stabilized the MKP-1 mRNA, although only HuR promoted MKP-1 translation. Ongoing studies are examining the regulation of HO-1 mRNA expression in response to nitric oxide. This process was found to be robustly regulated by stabilization of the HO-1 mRNA through the association of RBPs.',\n",
       " 'Our previous data has clearly implicated members of the claudin family in ovarian tumorigenmesis. In this fiscal year, we have made significant progress in identifying the mechanisms of claudin-3 and -4 regulation as well as the possible roles these proteins may have in ovarian cancer progression. We have shown that both claudin -3 and claudin-4 are phosphorylated in ovarian cancer cells (by PKA and PKC, respectively) and that this phosphorylation has significant functional consequences. Indeed, we have shown that this phosphorylation can contribute to the dismantlement of tight junctions in ovarian cancer. In addition, we have also continued our work investigating the mechanisms regulating the CLDN3 and CLDN4 promoters. We have found that these promoters are highly affected by DNA methylation and histone acetylation and that they require the SP1 transcription factor for activity. We are currently identifying enhancers that may be important in the co-regulation of CLDN3 and CLDN4. We are also studying claudin-7, another claudin that involved in ovarian cancer. We have now demonstrated that claudin-7 is expressed in a large number of ovarian tumors and that it may have roles in survival and cell invasion. Drug resistance represent a major clinical problem in the treatment of ovarian cancer, but the exact mechanisms involved in the development of resistance are unclear. In this fiscal year, we have use microarrays to identify gene differentially expressed in our model of ovarian cancer drug resistance. We have identified several interesting candidate genes and pathways that may be involved in this phenomenon. We are hoping that a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to drug resistance may suggest approaches for alternative therapies or for strategies aimed at reversing drug resistance.',\n",
       " 'HANDLS Healthy Aging Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program (IRP) has been long interested in the cellular and molecular mechanisms of normative aging and age-related disease development. The program has pursued basic laboratory and longitudinal clinical research in normative aging to address these interests. NIA intramural investigators have expanded the program\\'s capacity to address hypotheses about aging and health disparities in minority and poor populations. By posing fundamental questions about differences in rates and risks for pathological conditions associated with aging, studying groups with diverse racial, ethnic, and economic origins, IRP clinical researchers hope to understand the significance of environmental and genetic risk factors for disease. The need to understand the driving factors behind persistent black-white health disparities in overall longevity, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease, has led to the effort to develop and plan the NIA IRP Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study is a community-based, epidemiologically driven research effort designed to focus on evaluating health disparities in socioeconomically diverse African Americans and whites in Baltimore. This study is unique because it is a multidisciplinary project that assesses physical parameters as well as evaluating genetic, biologic, demographic, psychosocial, and psychophysiological parameters of Black and White participants in higher and lower socioeconomic status (SES) over a 20-year period. It also employs novel research tools, mobile medical research vehicles to improve participation rates and retention among non-traditional research participants. The initial examination and recruitment phase will take approximately 3 years to complete. The study data will be collected in two parts. The first part consists of an in-home interview that includes questionnaires about the participant\\'s health status, health service utilization, psychosocial factors, nutrition, neighborhood characteristics, and demographics. The second part will be collected on the medical research vehicles and includes medical history and physical examination, dietary recall, cognitive evaluation, psychophysiology assessments including heart rate variability, arterial thickness, carotid ultrasonography, assessments of muscle strength and bone density, and laboratory measurements (blood chemistries, hematology, biomarkers of oxidative stress and biomaterials for genetic studies The HANDLS study is a multidisciplinary, prospective epidemiologic longitudinal study examining the influences and interaction of race and SES on the development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health disparities among minority and lower SES subgroups. The baseline HANDLS sample will consist of approximately 4,000 community-dwelling African American and white adults aged 30-64. Participants are being drawn from 12 pre-determined census tracts in Baltimore City, sampling representatively across a wide range of socioeconomic and income circumstances. The heuristic study design is a factorial cross of four factors: age, sex, race, and SES with approximately equal numbers of subjects per \"cell.\" HANDLS is planned as a 20-year longitudinal study. Using our mobile medical research vehicles, we will visit each census tract for 3 months and we will re-visit every census tract in a 3-year cycle. The 12 census tracts identified were selected because they are likely to yield representative distributions of individuals between 30 and 64 years old who are African Americans and whites, men and women, and lower and higher SES. Individuals calling themselves multi-ethnics will be included and categorized by the group with which they most strongly identify, but their multi-ethnic identification will be recorded for subsequent statistical analyses. Multi-ethnic individuals who identify strongly with neither African Americans nor whites will be excluded from the present study. Initial estimates based on the 2000 census data indicate that we will need to visit approximately 35% of the households in each census tract to collect the required 333 individuals. The initial sample of 4,000 participants is based on power analyses and assumptions about attrition over 20 years. For a power of 80% (the likelihood of finding an effect if it is really present), we can identify moderate effects (magnitude of the differences between groups) for various outcomes with as few as 30 participants per group at the end of the study. Working backwards by assuming 20% attrition after the baseline assessment and 15% attrition between subsequent assessments, we need approximately 4,000 participants at baseline to yield 1,680 after 20 years (Figure 1). The recruitment phase and initial examination will take approximately 3 years to complete. The study has completed a pilot phase that was conducted in two waves (October 2000-December 2001 and February 2003-November 2003). The epidemiologic phase of the study began in August 2004 with a field based dress rehearsal in the South Baltimore area of the city. The full study began on November 1, 2004 in the Reservoir Hill area of Baltimore. Thus far, the study had recruited 989 participants in the South Baltimore, Reservoir Hill, Cherry Hill and Govans neighborhoods of Baltimore. This comprises the first portion of the first year of the 3 year baseline assessment. Recruitment will continue for 2 1 2 additional years to complete cohort recruitment. Covariates--Other variables such as nutrition, environment and neighborhood effects, genetic make-up, family history, activity level, access to health care, and prevalent medical, dental, psychiatric conditions, oxidative stress, and DNA repair capacity may modulate the effects of SES and race on cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, cognitive, and autonomic functioning. For example: The nutritional domain of the study will examine the effects of race socioeconomic status (SES) on nutritional status and identify nutritional factors that may contribute to health disparity in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health and cognitive function. The biomarkers domain of the study will examine possible biologic covariates of health disparities and aging. The early appearance and increased severity of age-associated disease among African Americans and low SES individuals suggests that the factors contributing to the emergence of health disparities may also induce a phenotype of \\'premature aging\\' or \\'accelerated aging\\'. While we do not posit that health disparities result from genetic alterations in genes associated with the known heritable progeroid syndromes. We do hypothesize that in low SES populations with high rates of early onset age-associated disease the interaction of biologic, psychosocial, socioeconomic and environmental factors may result in a phenotype of accelerated aging biologically similar to these syndromes with increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, premature accumulation of oxidative DNA damage, defects in DNA repair and higher levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress. Health disparities therefore, may be the end product of this complex interaction in populations at high risk. HANDLS will examine this hypothesis by measuring biomarkers of oxidative stress, assessing levels of the most widely studied oxidative DNA adduct, and measuring DNA repair capacity in study participants. Prospectively measuring biomarkers of oxidative stress in a longitudinal study may clarify whether oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in aging and in the development and or progression of age associated disease. It may also provide insights into the different trajectories of aging observed in individuals.',\n",
       " 'Epidemiological studies indicate that behavioral stresses can participate in the development of primary hypertension, but the mediating physiological mechanisms remain to be clarified. Studies from our laboratory have provided support for the view that hypertension can develop as an interaction between high sodium intake and aversive behavioral conditioning procedures that suppress respiratory activity. The mechanism is hypothesized to involve increases in pCO2, renal Na H exchange, renal Na retention, stimulation of endogenous digitalis-like sodium pump inhibitors (EDLF) and inhibition of Na pump activity in vascular smooth muscle, leading to increases in intravascular Na and Ca, and increased total peripheral resistance in a context of increased plasma volume. During the current year, stability of resting end tidal CO2 (PETCO2) in normotensive human subjects, its associations with personality factors, and the differential effects of high dietary sodium intake on resting and ambulatory blood pressure of younger (below age 40) and older (above age 40) humans as a function of individual resting PETCO2 were investigated. Resting PETCO2 was found to be relatively stable over a six month period, and to be highest in subjects who were high on the NEO Neuroticism Scale (which assesses experience of negative emotional states). High dietary Na intake was associated with increased overnight urinary Na excretion and increased body weight in all subjects, regardless of PETCO2 status. In older adults, higher resting PETCO2 was associated with increases in both resting and 24-hour blood pressure. In younger adults, high Na intake increased 24-hour, but not resting, blood pressure. Plasma EDLF was higher in subjects with higher resting PETCO2, both before and after Na loading, indicating increased plasma volume in Na sensitive subjects. These are the first studies to identify PETCO2 as a risk factor for Na sensitivity, and open a new area of investigation of the origins of individual differences in resting PETCO2. ',\n",
       " 'Concentrations of endogenous digitalis-like factors (EDLF) that inhibit Na pump activity are elevated in hypertensive humans and laboratory animals, but their chemical structures, the causes of these elevations, and their role in the development of hypertension remain to be clarified. EDLF include a ouabain-like compound (OLC) that is primarily of adrenal origin, and a more recently discovered bufodienolide (i.e. a marinobufagenin-like compound or MBG), so-called since it was first isolated in toad venom. Studies in our laboratory have shown that MBG is a more rapidly acting and more potent constrictor of rat aorta than OLC, that plasma concentrations of MBG are stimulated during (a) expansion on plasma volume of dogs, (b) conditioned respiratory suppression that increases pCO2 in micropigs, and (c) intervals of voluntary hypoventilation by humans. During the current year, administration of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (which stimulates adrenocortical activity) for seven days was found to increase concentrations of MBG in plasma and inhibit Na pump activity in vascular smooth muscle of rats. This study showed that changes in Na,K-ATPase activity in vascular smooth muscle cannot necessarily be inferred from changes in erythrocyte Na,K-ATPase activity. In addition, MBG administration was found to have a greater inhibitory effect on alpha-1 isoforms of Na,K-ATPase, which predominate in vascular smooth muscle, than administration of ouabain, while ouabain had a greater inhibitory effect on alpha-3 isoforms of Na,K-ATPase, which predominate in neural tissues The ability of cells to increase genetic expression of Na,K-ATPase to compensate for inhibitory effects of sodium pump inhibitors remains to be clarified, as do the effects on vascular tone and blood pressure of sustained elevations in MBG.

       " 'A new BLSA study of Prostate Growth and Disease was begun in February 1993 to examine anatomic and physiologic correlates of normal prostate growth and the development and progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. In the past year, three studies have been completed. The first BLSA study developed age-specific reference ranges for prostate-specific antigen velocity (rate of change) and compared the sensitivity and specificity of different prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria for the detection of prostate cancer. In order to determine the optimal PSA testing regimen, the second study examined the variability in PSA levels in men with BPH and prostate cancer when measured at different time intervals. This study showed that PSA measurements obtained at 3 month or 6 month intervals are unlikely to be clinically useful. The third study developed age-specific norms for serum androgen levels in men (see Project Z01 AG 0013-20 LCP). These norms will be used to examine the relationship between age-adjusted androgen levels and risk of BPH or prostate cancer. ',\n",

       " 'Over the past several years, we have studied self reported levels of physical activity in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) subjects. Increasing age is associated with a decline in physical activity, cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and muscle mass. These changes contribute to sarcopenia and frailty in the elderly. We have been interested in how changing physical activity impacts on these other activity related processes. Over the past year, we have completed an evaluation of self-reported falls in BLSA subjects. Falls in older people have been characterized extensively in the literature, however little has been reported regarding falls in middle-aged and younger adults. We compared falls in three age groups of subjects, young 20-45 years), middle-aged (46-65 years) and older (>65 years) men and women. The reporting of falls increased with age from 18% in young, to 21% in middle aged and 35% in older adults, with higher rates in women than men. Ambulation was cited as the cause of the fall most frequently in all gender and age groups. An injury of some type was reported in 70% of subjects. The young group reported injuries most frequently to wrist hand, knees and ankles; the middle-aged to their knees and the older group to their head and knees. Women reported a higher percentage of injuries in all age groups. This is the first study that we are aware of to compare falls in young, middle and older aged men and women. Significant differences were found between the three age groups with respect to number of falls, activities engaged in prior to falling, perceived causes of the fall and where they fell. A second study examined the impact of longitudinal patterns of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) on mortality. Higher levels of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) are associated with reduced mortality. However it is unclear how changes in LTPA over time impact all cause mortality in men and women. Men (n=1316) and women (n=776) aged 19-90+ years from the BLSA were assessed for LTPA at baseline and at ~2 year intervals over a mean follow-up of 21.2 + 9.4 yr for men and 10.2 +5.6 yr for women. Death occurred in 538 men (40.9%) and 90 women (11.6%). LTPA was derived from self-reports of time spent in 97 activities converted into MET-minutes per 24 hours and was further grouped into high (>6 METs), moderate (4-5.9 METs) and low intensity LTPA (<4 METs). In younger (<70 years) men, those who reported improvement or negligible declines in total and high intensity LTPA had lower all cause mortality compared to those with greater declines in LTPA, independent of serum cholesterol, body mass index, hypertension and smoking status. In older (>70 years) men, the association between rate of change in high intensity LTPA and mortality was similar to that seen in younger men. Cross-sectional age patterns for women showed no difference in rates of change in total, high, or low intensity LTPA between survivors or decedents; however older (>70 years) decedents decreased their moderate intensity LTPA as compared to survivors. For women, longitudinal analyses showed neither rates of change in total, high, moderate nor low intensity LTPA were predictive of mortality. In this health-conscious population, greater longitudinal declines in total and high intensity LTPA are independent predictors of all cause mortality in men but not women. The observations in women are not consistent with other studies and may relate to low power due to relatively few deaths in the women over the follow up. The observations in men argue that the maintenance of a physical activity level is important for longevity. How to increase participation in physical activity has become a major health issue. The answer will lie in offering a variety of programs that allow for individualization. At present, a project is underway where we are using the same strategy and applying it to military reservist who do not meet fitness requirements for a 2 mile run. The goal is to increase their overall activity levels by making them more aware of what they are actually performing, and to set reasonable goals to increase activity during the course of their busy schedules.',\n",
       " ' of work: Studies of gender differences and individual variability in age- related phenomena are being carried out to: 1) determine the \"normal\" range of variability in human aging, 2) identify potential sources of variability which may be responsive to intervention, and 3) determine if there are subgroups of individuals who are more susceptible or resistant to various aspects of aging. The research combines the use of sophisticated statistical methodologies and the unique time depth and multidisciplinary breadth of the existing BLSA data base to examine issues related to the concepts of \"normal\" and \"successful\" aging, as well as to increase the power of traditional research designs. The statistical methods used include longitudinal regression models, time dependent proportional hazards analysis, and finite mixture models. Results from these models can provide contributions to the theoretical and methodological development of biomedical risk factor studies, as well as to an increased understanding of the dynamics of the aging process. Research is in progress to develop more refined methods of studying variability in aging in order to develop theoretically and methodologically sound approaches to risk factor analysis which account for changes in an individual\\'s covariates over time and the possibility that individuals differ in susceptibility or resistance to aging process.',\n",
       " ' of work: Unnecessary morbidity and mortality is an important problem which leads to increased health-care costs and can ultimately result in premature death. It has been estimated that approximately two-thirds of mortality is due to potentially preventable causes - 1.2 million deaths (65%) and 8.4 million years of life lost before age 65 (63%). Principal factors associated with unnecessary morbidity and mortality include tobacco use, high blood pressure, improper nutrition, lack of screening and prevention services, alcohol abuse, and injury. This project uses longitudinal data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and other studies to examine the influence of modifiable risk factors on the occurrence of premature deaths and unnecessary morbidity and disability. Identification of risk factors can lead to primary prevention efforts.',\n",
       " 'Age associated losses of strength occur slowly over the adult lifespan. Most research has focused on what occurs in the elderly. However, the primary processes start at a much earlier age, and in young and middle-aged workers, the early losses contribute to work related injuries and for some occupations, job performance. The causes of age related strength losses are multifactoral, with research focusing on age-associated loss of muscle with age that has been referred to as sarcopenia, While sarcopenia has been mainly studied in the elderly where the greatest changes in muscle mass and strength manifest, by age 50 the average individual has lost 10% of their maximal strength. While sarcopenia is clearly a major factor in strength loss, there are other contributors to the changes in maximal function. To understand sarcopenia these other factors need to be studied. Our goal is to understand the time course of strength loss, factors that contribute to the loss, what degree the exercise response differs between old and young individuals, and what forms of motivators and alternative exercise programs might impact on the losses. We have used several different approaches to address these issues. First are descriptive studies using the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). These studies focus on describing the characteristic losses that occur in muscle strength mass, and physical functioning that occur with aging by examining the entire adult lifespan and their impact on function and longevity. We have previously demonstrated that declining muscle strength and rate of change of muscle strength are independent contributors to mortality in men when considering age, physical activity and muscle mass. Over the past year, we have further shown that muscle power, and the speed of movement are further independent sarcopenic factors that contribute to longevity. The observations suggest that central nervous system processes are contributing to the importance of sarcopenia on longevity. Second, working with collaborators at the University of Maryland, we have been examining genetic contributions related to muscle hypertrophy and strength. We have identified several genes that contribute to the inherited aspects of how much muscle and strength we have. As an example, we are reporting that IGF-II genotype is related to muscle strength but not muscle mass. This is consistent with the mortality data, where muscle mass and muscle strength have common and different effects on outcome. Also, we found that IL6 and CNTF genotype had some influence on body composition which impacts on sarcopenia. Likewise, longer androgen receptor repeat in exon 1 in men is associated with higher testosterone blood levels and with greater levels of fat free mass. Third are intervention studies to alter the time course of strength and muscle mass changes. In previous work we demonstrated that the exercise response to resistive training is very similar in young and old subjects. However, while the response to strength training may be similar by age, there are clear differences in muscle responsiveness as represented by gene expression, and body compostion change differences. We have been interested in alternative strategies for exercise intervention. With Dr. Laura Talbot, we have examined two alternative exercise strategies using subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee. First was electromyostimulation, a passive activation of the knee extensor muscles using an electric stimulator. We tested a protocol that used NMES at much lower force levels, to make the stimulation more acceptable (i.e. with less or no pain), and to minimize the likelihood of injury in individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee. The NMES group used a portable electrical muscle stimulator to incrementally increase the intensity of isometric contraction over 12 weeks up to 20-40% of their maximal voluntary strength. We found an increase in muscle strength in response to this passive activity, and a decline in knee pain immediately following the treatment (though not a sustained effect). The second approach was to use home based pedometer driven motivational program resulted in improved walking, increased knee extensor strength, and modest functional improvements.',\n",
       " 'Age-related changes in muscle strength are an important contributor to frailty in the elderly. The time course and causes for these changes are poorly understood. This project examines the changes across the adult life span with an emphasis on what occurs early in middle age when the changes begin. The research consists of three parts. First is an ongoing study in the BLSA comparing concentric (shortening) and eccentric (elongation) phases of movement assessed at slow, fast and zero (isometric) speeds.Almost 500 male and female subjects from the 20s through the 80s have been tested and longitudinal data collection is beginning. Age associated declines are found in cross-sectional analysis for both concentric and eccentric testing for all muscle groups and speeds. The cross-sectionally determined rate of decline is greater in the quadriceps femoris than for the biceps brachii. The rates of decline in concentric and eccentric strength tend to be parallel in men. Concentric strength declined to a much greater extent than eccentric strength in women. Second is an analysis of twenty-five years of muscle and power measurements in the BLSA. The initial analysis examines the issue of how qualitative changes in muscle mass are related to strength. Creatinine excretion declined in a manner similar to muscle strength, while body mass index, cross sectional area and lean body mass showed less change.The study suggests that measures that examine muscle contractile components may show a stronger association with strength than cross sectional muscle area. Third are studies to examine the peripheral nerve contribution to strength loss. A protocol has been developed that explores motor unit function at different levels of muscle exertion in the quadriceps femoris. The technique shows reasonable test-retest reliability with a .1-.3 coefficient of variation. The size of recruited motor units increases at increasing percentage of maximal voluntary contraction. The study will examine the effects of the motor unit size and firing pattern. ',\n",
       " 'X-linked anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) is the most frequently occurring of more than 175 ectodermal dysplasias affecting one or more skin appendages. The gene that is mutated to cause this disorder encodes a protein, which we have named ectodysplasin-A, has a single transmembrane region with collagenous and TNF-ligand segments in a long extracelliular carboxyterminal tail. Because individuals with EDA have sparse hair, rudimentary teeth, and few sweat glands, the gene is likely involved at an early point in development. We had earlier shown that the promoter region has transcription elements that include enhancers, possibly implicated in the tissue specificity of the gene; they include sites that implicate the Wnt and EGF pathways. We had also demonstrated that the Tabby mouse, which has many of the features observed in human EDA, is specifically mutated in the orthologous mouse gene. The gene was known to have 3 different classes of protein products (isoforms); we have now found additional isoforms for the functional A form. We have been investigating whether the different protein products function to help form different skin appendages, or whether they cooperate for all skin appendage formation. To distinguish among these alternatives, we put one of the isoforms of the gene back into Tabby animals as a transgene. The result is unequivocal: various skin appendages are restored at least partially by that isoform. We have now found that the same isoform has two kinds of effects in embryonic mice: determining the formation of certain appendages, including some types of hair follicles, and increasing the size of others, including sebaceous glands. We also have characterized eye phenotypes of Tabby mice including blindness and inflammation susceptibility, and they are also reversed by supplementation with the same isoform. We are now beginning to look at Tabby animals transgenic for other (isoforms), or for combinations of isoforms, turning their formation on or off at defined times during fetal development in the mice by using a controllable promoter. Several groups have shown that the first known EDA isoforms can bind to different cellular receptors to effect the control of gene expression by a transcription control system (NF-kB). We are now doing tests to identify the receptors for newly found EDA isoforms to determine the relative contribution of different isoforms to the formation and maintenance of the appendages, and the pathways involved. To extend the analyses, we have initiated extensive microarray gene expression profiling for skin appendages at various times during their development. The studies thus far implicate a small number of genes that show significant quantitative changes in expression in Tabby compared to wild-type mouse skin. They include several major signal transduction pathways such as Wnt, SHH, and lymphotoxin in conjunction with NF-kB; and the changes are largely restored to normal levels in animals in which a transgene has restored much of the skin appendages. In ongoing complementary studies, extensions of promoter analyses are designed to understand the selective maintenance of ectodysplasin at a critical level in target cells; and the combination of histology, phenotype analysis, and gene expression assays in transgenic animals are providing information about the function of different isoforms.',\n",
       " 'From a sequence tagged site (STS) Bacterial Artificial Chromosome based physical map in mouse t-complex region 43 BACs were representing a minimal tiling path were selected, sequenced, annotated and deposited into the public databases. Based on the physical map the tw5 embryonic lethal locus mutation was refined to a single, 175 Kb BAC. Histological studies have demonstrated that mice homozygous for tw5 die at the gastrulation stage. The candidate BAC rescues the tw5 lethality, restoring viability. Our collaborator Dr. K. Abe is currently focusing on the search for the gene mutated in the tw5 embryonic lethality. Currently, we have focused our attention on the mouse homolog of human ADAMTS10 gene, which maps to the interval. Several metalloproteases play critical roles in cell-cell signal transduction. ADAMTS-10 gene, a zinc metalloendopeptidase with thrombospondin domains, is a potential candidate for important functions during development. Recently ADAMTS10 was found to be a candidate gene for Weill-Marchesani syndrome (MIM#277600). Previously we found that mouse ADAMTS-10 is alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific manner and encodes protein isoforms that either include or exclude the thrombospondin domains by truncation of the open reading frame. We have cloned and characterized 3 major isoforms from embryo, kidney and lung, and find that the embryo, for example, expresses an isoform that has a truncated translation product. The truncated embryonic and full-length kidney isoforms were transfected into 293 cells. We find that both isoforms are stably expressed and localize to the cytoplasm, as determined by immunocytochemistry. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated targeted to epitopes that could distinguish between different isoforms and are being purified and characterized for further use to define the protein function.',\n",
       " \" have used large-insert cloning to obtain yeast and bacterial artificial chromosome clones (YACs and BACs) containing two genes of importance in human reproduction: PLAC1, is expressed not only uniquely in placenta, where its expression is restricted to specific placental regions facing the maternal tissue; and it has been implicated both in cases of placental problems in inter-specific crosses of mice, and in fetal well being and successful outcome of pregnancy in humans. FOXL2 is expressed only in developing eyelids and in follicular cells of the ovarian follicles and deficiency in FOXL2 leads to Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) in some women (see AG000647-05). The goal is to determine the basis for the extraordinarily selective tissue-specific expression of these genes. In contrast to other instances such as liver-specific genes, the tissue specificity is not reproduced by segments of putative promoter DNA up to 10 Kb 5' of PLAC1 or FOXL2. This indicates that longer-range regulation is operative. Consistent with that notion, a translocation that disrupts transcription of FOXL2 lies very far (about 168 Kb away) from the gene sequence. We have now focused our attention on the regulation and function of PLAC1. Using an inducible lambda bacteriophage-based recombination system in bacteria, we have introduced a Flag tag into the C-terminal end of PLAC1 and retrofitted the BAC with a mammalian selectable drug marker, blasticidin. Upon transfection of this construct into choriocarcinoma derived BeWo cells which expresses native PLAC1 endogenously, we can detect transcripts derived from the modified BAC by RT-PCR. As a negative control, the same construct shows little if any transcription from the BAC in HeLa cells which do not express endogenous PLAC1. These results suggest that all the promoter elements necessary for specific transcription reside in the modified BAC. Next a set of targeted deletions removing 10Kb, 20Kb, and 62Kb blocks of DNA starting at the 5' to Exon 1 were generated using the recombination based approaches. These constructs are now being transfected and stable tranfectants established to check for transcription. To study the function of the gene in placenta, recombineering methods were also used to recover a fragment containing Plac1 coding and flanking sequences from a mouse BAC. The cloned fragment was modified to ablate the Plac1 sequence and replace it with a selectable neomycin resistance marker. This was transfected into ES cells, and neomycin-resistant ES cell clones are being screened for the loss of Plac1 as a step towards the generation of a knockout mouse model.\",\n",
       " 'Because the pool of ovarian follicles is set up during fetal life, the development of the ovary pre-determines female reproductive lifespan, including the time of onset of menopause. About 1-3% of all women undergo early menopause, either never going through menarche or stopping menstruation by the mid-30s, rather than reaching the standard reproductive lifespan of about 50. A fraction of such instances of early-onset premature ovarian failure (POF) is genetic. We have generated a mouse knock-out model for a gene that encodes a transcription factor, Foxl2, which that is mutated in some patients with early menopause (premature ovarian failure). We found that the earliest morphological anomalies involve a block in the formation of ovarian follicles, the fundamental units of ovary function. We then found that Foxl2- - newborn follicle cells undergo female-to-male sex reversal, suggesting that dysregulation of sex determining genes even beyond the time at which they are usually thought to be active -- may be involved in ovarian failure in young and adult females. We moved on to provide evidence for a link between embryonic sex determining genes and premature ovarian failure. A notable example is seen in mice that we prepared lacking both Folx2 and Wnt4 (a double knock-out). In those mice, all cell types, including germ cells, reverse their sex during early development. This is the first experimental model of complete female-to-male sex reversal in mammals. We plan to continues to study the interaction of Foxl2 and male sex determining factors in the ovary, and have now identified arms of the pathways regulated by Foxl2 and Wnt4. Genes in those pathways will now be assessed for their role in vitro (organ cultures) and in vivo. In parallel, we are studying another transcription factor, Foxo3 that is also critically involved in the regulation of follicle dynamics and in premature ovarian failure in a mouse model. Toward this aim, we have generated transgenic mice over expressing Foxl2 and Foxo3 to test their effect on follicle fate and reproductive lifespan. Overall, we propose a paradigm in which Foxl2 is required both for ovary differentiation and for the maintenance of female sex determination in the ovarian soma; and we also suggest that defects in Foxl2 and its pathway may thus be involved in a number of types of fertility problems.',\n",
       " \"The ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes play important roles in gene regulation by opening chromatin structures for transcriptional activators or repressors. The prototype of this type of complexes is the SWI SNF complex, which was found in diverse organisms, including yeast, Drosophila, mouse and human. It is required for proper expression of homeotic genes and segmentation in Drosophila, and mutation in one subunit of the complex causes pediatric rhabdoid cancer in humans. We have purified several human SWI SNF-related complexes. By microsequencing, we have identified and cloned all the subunits from the major form of the complex. Analysis revealed that BAF250a contains a DNA binding domain similar to yeast SWI1, and several LXXLL motifs, which have been previously shown to be able to interact with nuclear hormone receptors. Using transient transfection assays, we found that BAF250a in fact facilitates transcriptional activation by glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The region containing LXXLL motifs of BAF250 also interacts with GR in vitro. This work suggests that BAF250a may be a targeting subunit of hSWI SNF, and may mediate the recruitment of the complex to DNA-bound glucocorticoid receptors. As a continuation of this project, we have cloned a novel human homolog of BAF250a, termed BAF250b. The two genes share over 60% of identity and possess same type of domain structure. We have now isolated a BAF250b-containing complex. It shares several identical subunits with BAF250a complex but also contains its own unique components. One unique subunit is ENL, a fusion partner for MLL which is a common target for chromosomal translocation in human acute leukemia. ENL is also the human ortholog of yeast SWI SNF subunit, TFG3. We demonstrated that the resultant MLL-ENL fusion protein also assciates with a human SWI SNF complex. Moreover, the fusion protein cooperates with SWI SNF to activate the promoter of HOXA7, which is a downstream target of MLL and is essential for oncogenic activity of the MLL fusion proteins. Our data suggest that human SWI SNF complexes show considerable hetergeneity, and one or more may be involved in the etiology of leukemia by functioning with MLL-fusion proteins. We are continuing to identify the genes that are specifically dependent on BAF, but not PBAF, for expression. Using siRNA, we were able to deplete the BAF-specific subunit, BAF250. We showed that one interferon-responsive gene, IFGM3, specifically depends on BAF but not PBAF for expression. This result demonstrates that BAF and PBAF have selectivity in mediating expression of different genes. We plan to investigate the mechanism of how BAF is targeted to IFGM3 and other genes. Recently, we initiated a new collaborative project with Drs. Minoru Ko and Zhong Wangs labs to study the function of SWI SNF complexes in the maintenance of pluripotency of ES cells. SWI SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are known to be essential for early embryonic development in mice. However, the roles of these complexes in embryonic stem (ES) cells are poorly understood. One reason is that mice deficient in common components of SWI SNF complexes die very early, before the ES cells can be established. In this project, we show that two subgroups of SWI SNF complexes associated with BAF250a (a.k.a. Arid1a) and BAF250b (a.k.a. Arid1b) are present at high levels in undifferentiated ES cells, and their levels decrease when ES cells are induced to differentiate. We generated mouse ES cells deficient in BAF250b by gene targeting, and found that these cells have a reduced proliferation rate and an abnormal cell cycle. More importantly, they lost the self-renewal capacity of ES cells and displayed multiple markers characteristic of differentiated cells. Microarray and subsequent qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that these cells have reduced expression of several genes involved in pluripotency of ES cells, and increased expression of several differentiation genes. These data suggest that the BAF250b-associated SWI SNF is essential for mouse ES cells to maintain its normal proliferation and undifferentiated state. On a related project, we collaborated with Drs. Gong and Smerdon's labs and showed that SWI SNF complex is involved in the cellular response pathway to UV-induced DNA damage. This study uncovers another mechanism of SWI SNF in protecting genome stability.\",\n",
       " 'The ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, Rsc, was originally identified in yeast. It has a subunit composition similar to the well-characterized SWI SNF: 2 subunits are shared between the two complexes and at least 4 others are homologous. However, the function of Rsc is distinct from SWI SNF. Rsc is essential for the mitotic growth of yeast, whereas SWI SNF is not. Rsc mutants are arrested at the G2 M transition during the cell cycle, and the arrest is dependent on spindle-checkpoint genes. The mutants are also more sensitive to microtubule- destabilizing drugs. These data suggest that Rsc may play a role in mitosis, perhaps by stabilizing mitotic spindle formation or have a function at kinetochores. We have previously purified several ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes from human that are closely related to either yeast SWI SNF or Rsc. By microsequencing and cloning, we now identified the BAF180 subunit of human SWI SNF-B complex as a human homologue of yeast Rsc subunits, Rsc1, Rsc2 and Rsc4. It has the same set of biochemical motifs as the three Rsc subunits: 6 bromodomains, 2 BAH regions, and a minor-groove binding domain. Database search of the completed genome database of human, Drosophila and C.elegans showed that BAF180 is the closest homolog of the three Rsc subunits, suggesting human SWI SNF-B as a human version of Rsc. We renamed this complex as PBAF (for Polybromo-associated BAF complex). We subsequently identified many other subunits of human PBAF complex and found a number of them to be identical to those in human SWI SNF. We also demonstrated that BAF180 localizes at kinetochores of mitotic chromosomes, consistent with a function for PBAF during mitosis. Part of this work has been published in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA in 2000. As a continuation of this project, we have identified three possible new components of this complex. We have obtained antibody against one of them, BAF200. With this antibody, we have been able to show that BAF200 is indeed an intrinsic component of this complex. In a paper published in 2005 in Genes and Development, We provided in vivo evidence that PBAF and BAF selectively regulate expression of distinct interferon-responsive genes: PBAF is required for expression of IFGM1, whereas BAF is required for IFGM3. Because PBAF and BAF share 8 identical subunits, the unique subunits that distinguish the two complexes must play a key role in selectively targeting each complex to their respective genes. We showed that between the two unique subunits of PBAF, BAF180 and BAF200, only the latter is required for expression of IFGM1. Our study demonstrated the importance of BAF200 in PBAF functions, and suggested that BAF200 likely serves as a targeting subunit for PBAF. We are now investigating the underlying mechanism of how BAF200 targets PBAF to its target genes. As a first step, we identified a cell line that lacks BAF200. We were able to re-introduce exogenous BAF200 into this cell line, and reactivate the PBAF complex. Using these two lines, we have performed cDNA microarray analysis and identifed many genes whose expression were either up-regulated or down-regulated by re-introduction of BAF200. We confirmed the microarray data by RT-PCR. We are investigating several candidate genes and determine how they are regulated by PBAF.',\n",
       " 'Preimplantation development encompasses the period from fertilization to implantation. These early embryos are the source of Embryonic stem (ES) cells and the locus of nuclear reprogramming. Therefore, the molecular study of these early embryos is very important for stem cell biology and its potential therapeutic applications to aging and dysfunctional organs tissues. Our goal is to apply systematic genomic approaches to these early embryos and to understand their regulation of gene expression. We carried out DNA microarray-based global expression profiling of all preimplantation stages in mouse, which revealed and characterized the distinctive patterns of maternal RNA degradation and two major transient waves of de novo transcription: zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and mid-preimplantation gene activation (MGA). Through these analyses, we identified a number of genes that show unique expression patterns. We have demonstrated that one of them, named Zga1, is expressed exclusively in 2-cell mouse embryos and ES cells and plays a critical role in the progression of preimplantation development. We also found that a gene called Chuk shows constant RNA levels throughout preimplantation development and can be used as an internal standard suitable for quantitative RT-PCR (Falco et al., 2006). We also developed a technique to do large-scale Whole Mount In Situ Hybridization (WISH), which allows us to reveal the spatial expression patterns of 91 genes in mouse preimplantation embryos (Yoshikawa et al., 2006). We are currently studying the functions of these genes in details.',\n",

During the last one-year period, we have accomplished the following additional goals. 1) We have developed a glass-slide microarray platform containing in situ-synthesized 60-mer oligonucleotide probes representing approximately 44,000 unique mouse transcripts. 2) We have produced web-based ANOVA-FDR software to provide user-friendly microarray data analysis too. 3) We have developed an algorithm and a fully-automated computational pipeline for transcript assembly from expressed sequences aligned to the mouse genome. We have identified 191,946 genomic loci, which included 27,497 protein-coding genes and 11,906 additional gene candidates (e.g., non-protein-coding, but multi-exon). 4) We have developed a high throughput whole-mount in situ hybridization technique for preimplantation mouse embryos and ES cells.

The gene defective in BS has recently been cloned (named BLM) and was found to belong to an evolutionarily conserved helicase family, called RecQ. The recombinant BLMp protein has been shown to possess a helicase activity in vitro, suggesting that BS could be caused by a defect in a DNA metabolic reaction, such as replication or repair. Interestingly, BLM gene belongs to the helicase family, like the genes mutated in Werner Syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS). All three diseases have some common features, such as genetic instability and predisposition to cancer. But each disease has its own distinctive symptoms. For example, WS patients prematurely display many age-related features, including osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, diabetes and cataracts, which are not observed in BS or RTS. Also, WS individuals do not show immunodeficiency or photosensivity like BS patients. To understand the molecular mechanism of these human diseases, we propose to isolate the protein complexes containing each gene product. To investigate the mechanism of BS, we isolated from human HeLa extracts three complexes containing the helicase defective in BS, BLM. Interestingly, one of the complexes, termed BRAFT, also contains five of the Fanconi anemia (FA) complementation group proteins (FA). FA resembles BS in genomic instability and cancer predisposition, but most of its gene products have no known biochemical activity and the molecular pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood. BRAFT displays a DNA-unwinding activity, which requires the presence of BLM because complexes isolated from BLM-deficient cells lack such an activity. The complex also contains topoisomerase IIIa and replication protein A, proteins that are known to interact with BLM and could facilitate unwinding of DNA. We find that BLM complexes isolated from a FA cell line have a lower molecular mass. Our study provides the first biochemical characterization of a multiprotein FA complex and suggests a connection between the BLM and FA pathways of genomic maintenance. The findings that FA proteins are part of a DNA-unwinding complex imply that FA proteins may participate in DNA repair. Much of this work has recently been published in Mol. Cell. Biol. In a paper published in EMBO J this year, we showed that BLAP75 is a component of all three BLM complexes from HeLa cells. Using siRNA knockdown techniques, we show that BLAP75 is essential for BLM complex stability in vivo. Consistent with a role in BLM-mediated processes, BLAP75 co-localizes with BLM in subnuclear foci in response to DNA damage, and its depletion impairs the recruitment of BLM to these foci. Depletion of BLAP75 by siRNA also results in deficient phosphorylation of BLM during mitosis, as well as defective cell proliferation. Moreover, cells depleted of BLAP75 display an increased level of sister-chromatid exchange, similar to cells depleted of BLM by siRNA. Thus, BLAP75 is an essential component of the BLM-associated cellular machinery that maintains genome integrity. After our paper has been published, two other labs used genetic approaches to show that the yeast homolog of BLAP75 is also a component of RecQ helicase-Topo IIIa complex, and is required for maintaining genome stability. Thus, both biochemistry in human and genetics in yeast have reached the same conclusion. Together, these data suggest that BLAP75 and its homologs in various species have a conserved function in guarding genome. We are currently examining the importance of another BLM complex component, BLAP250, in genome maintanence.',\n",
       " 'Systematic analyses of transcripts in early embryogenesis by the group of Dr. M. Ko in our Laboratory have uncovered a relative dearth of X-linked genes. Nevertheless, some X-linked genes show prominent effects in early development. Three of these have been chosen for special study. One, Bex-3, had not been previously studied. The transcribed sequence is 789 bp in length and encodes a protein of 124 residues with a CAAX motif at its C-terminal end. It appears in a single cDNA and Northern species of 1.1 kb. Expression declines after the fetal period, but adult mouse and human show sustained expression in several organs, including brain, testis and ovary. We find Bex3 protein selectively associated with the subset of mitochondria that are actively replicating their DNA; Bex3 is the first marker for a stage in the mitochondria cycle. Its association is consequential, because siRNA experiments show that Bex3 is required for continued growth of target cells. A second gene, GPC3, causes the overgrowth Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome when it is interrupted; and we have shown that a mouse defective for the gene shows comparable effects on growth. A third gene, PLAC1, has important features that include: 1) expression with high specificity in placenta from early on in development; and 2) X-linkage very near the HPRT gene, at a location that makes it a candidate for involvement in placental dysplasia and placentomegaly when it is under- or overexpressed. It is one of very few genes that show very greatly increased activity in cloned animals, associated with placentomegaly. We have analyzed the structure of the cDNA and genomic form of PLAC1, and have shown that it is localized in giant cells and labyrinthine trophoblasts in the developing placenta, between 7.5 and 14.5 days post coitum. In additional studies with collaborators, we have found that the gene is comparably expressed in human placenta, but strong expression lasts longer, all the way to term. Currently we have started to analyze the basis for tissue-specific expression of the gene. Extensive transfections with constructs containing increasing amounts of DNA upstream of the transcription unit, fused to luciferase have thus far shown that neither 3.3 nor 7.5 kb of upstream DNA is sufficient to support the transcription of the gene in choriocarcinoma cells that express the endogenous PLAC1 gene. We interpret our results to mean that the specific expression of the gene involves more distant upstream (or intragenic!) elements, and are continuing to study increasingly large genomic regions to define regulatory elements more precisely; that work is being continued in another project.',\n",
       " 'ATRX syndrome represents a combination of alpha-thalassemia, mental retardation, and multiple associated developmental abnormalities. The gene defective in ATRX has been localized to the X chromosome and cloned. Mutations in the same gene also cause several other forms of syndromal X-linked mental retardation. The ATRX gene encodes a gene product containing a SWI2 SNF2-type DNA-dependent ATPase domain. Thus, it has been hypothesized that ATRX could function in an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex and participate in regulation of gene expression. We established a collaboration with Drs. Doug Higgs and Richard Gibbons, who had cloned the ATRX gene, and have discovered important features of its function. By immunoprecipitation from HeLa extract, we found that ATRX is in a complex with transcription cofactor Daxx. The following evidence supports that ATRX and Daxx are components of an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex: 1) Daxx and ATRX can be coimmunoisolated by antibodies specific for each protein; 2) a proportion of Daxx co-fractionates with ATRX as a complex of 1 MDa by gelfiltration analysis; 3) in extract of cells of a patient with ATRX syndrome, the level of the Daxx-ATRX complex is correspondingly reduced; 4) a proportion of ATRX and Daxx colocalize in PML nuclear bodies, where Daxx had previously been found; and 5) ATRX complex displays ATP-dependent activities that resemble those of other chromatin remodeling complexes, including triple helix DNA displacement and alteration of mononucleosome disruption patterns. But unlike the previously described SWI SNF or NURD complexes, the ATRX complex does not randomize DNA phasing of the mononucleosomes, suggesting that it may remodel chromatin differently. Taken together, the results suggest that ATRX functions in conjunction with Daxx as a novel chromatin-remodeling complex. The defects in ATR-X syndrome may result from inappropriate expression of genes controlled by this complex.We have identified several sequence-specific transcription factors that co-purify with Daxx. We are now studying if the genes regulated by these factors could be involved in ATR-X syndrome.',\n",
       " 'Rothmund Thomson Syndrome (RTS) is a rare disease associated with genome instability, predisposition to cancer, skin and skeletal abnormalities, and some features of premature aging. The disease is caused by mutation in RECQL4, a putative helicase of the RecQ family which includes WRN and BLM, proteins defective in Werner and Bloom syndromes, respectively. To understand the mechanism of this disease, we have purified a human RECQL4 complex and identified its associated components. We found that the bulk of RECQL4 was present in a cytoplasmic extract of HeLa cells, in contrast to the largely nuclear BLM and WRN helicases. However, in untransformed WI-38 fibroblasts, RECQL4 was found to be largely nuclear, and was present at significantly lower total levels than in transformed HeLa cells. RECQL4 from HeLa cells was isolated as a stable complex with UBR1 and UBR2. These 200 kD proteins are ubiquitin ligases of the N-end rule pathway, whose substrates include proteins with destabilizing N-terminal residues. The functions of this proteolytic pathway include the regulation of peptide import, chromosome stability, meiosis, apoptosis, and cardiovascular development. Although the known role of UBR1 and UBR2 is to mediate polyubiquitylation (and subsequent degradation) of their substrates, the UBR1 2-bound RECQL4 was not ubiquitylated in vivo, and was a long-lived protein in HeLa cells. The isolated RECQL4-UBR1 2 complex had a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity but was inactive in DNA-based assays for helicases and translocases, the assays in which the BLM helicase was active. Our data suggest that RECQL4 and ubiquitin ligases of the N-end rule pathway may play a role in maintaining genomic stability. The first report of these studies is now published in Human Molecular Genetics.',\n",
       " 'Embryonic stem (ES) cells have the ability to give rise to all cell types, including germ lines (pluripotent), and the ability to undergo an unlimited number of symmetrical divisions without differentiation (self-renewal). For potential therapeutic applications of stem cells, it is paramount to understand how the ES cells maintain their pluripotency and self-renewal, and how the ES cells differentiate into specific cell lineages in vitro. The goal of this research project is to understand the relevant nature of mouse embryonic and tissue stem cells, and to identify genes that are responsible for the maintenance of cellular pluripotency. In our earlier work, we compared the global expression profiles of mouse ES cells and trophoblast stem (TS) cells by DNA microarrays. We studied Esg1, one of the genes identified as a gene expressed specifically in ES cells, and found that the gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that binds to many RNA targets (Tanaka et al., 2006). We have also compared the expression profiles of mouse ES cells undergoing neural differentiation in vitro and those of adult neural stem progenitor (NS) cells (Aiba et al., 2006). The results suggested that ES cells undergoing neural differentiation in vitro recapitulate the development of neural lineages in vivo. We also found a set of ~4,000 genes, the expression of which increased with neural commitment differentiation and can be used as a scale for the degree of commitment differentiation in neural differentiation. We are extending these studies by carrying out global gene expression profiling of mouse embryonic germ (EG) cells and multipotent adult stem cells (MAPCs).',\n",
       " \"Over the past year, work on this project has focused on two different types of skeletal dysplasia: (1) the achondroplasia family of skeletal dysplasias and (2) an autosomal recessive form of skeletal dysplasia, Cartilage Hair Hypoplasia (CHH). The achondroplasia family of skeletal dysplasias includes three previously recognized diagnoses and one that has been defined under this project. The three well-established conditions are achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia (TD). Work published by our lab in the past described a new syndrome, Severe Achondroplasia with Developmental Delay and Acanthosis Nigricans (SADDAN). All four disorders in this family of conditions are caused by mutations in the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Using a knock-in strategy, mice heterozygous for K644E and K644M mutations have been generated. Tissue-specific expression of the K644E mutation has been accomplished using mice carrying the cre recombinase under the control of tissue-specific promoters. These mice are assisting in assessing the contribution of mutant FGFR3 expression in the developing central nervous system to morbidity and mortality in these disorders. We are using microarray studies to dissect the downstream pathways associated with pathogenesis of these three disorders. Cartilage hair hypoplasia (CHH) is known to be caused by mutations in the RNMP gene, which encodes an RNA that participates in the Mitochondrial Ribonuclear Protein complex. Dr. Shepherd Schurman and Joseph Tran have begun work to create a mouse model for Cartilage Hair Hypoplasia, in collaboration with Dr. Fabio Candotti and the NHGRI transgenic mouse core facility. In addition to our work on specific skeletal dysplasias, Dr. ZJ Zhang used in vitro methods to create and enhance an organ culture method for the development of cartilage. It is hoped that these studies will lead to the development of treatment strategies for mendelian and complex disorders of cartilage growth and development. Dr. Zhang has shown that pulsed low intensity ultrasound produces a demonstrable anabolic effect on matrix production and chondrocyte hypertrophy. Dr. Zhang's work describing the effects of pulsed low intensity ultrasound was published in 2003 in Ultrasound Mol Biol. Dr. Zhang has also been pursing studies designed to investigate the utility of pellet-culture for cartilage engineering, isolated chondrocytes were grown in pellet culture for 2 weeks. The chondrocyte phenotype was stabilized in this specially designed culture system as show by aggrecan staining and immunohistochemistry for type II collagen. During the culture period, chondrocytes maintained expression of type IX collagen, which functions to link collagen fiber with aggrecan. The reconstruction of extracellular matrix was demonstrated by electron microscopy. By 2 weeks, the fiber network in the engineered cartilage was similar to the native cartilage at fiber diameter and density, but the fiber orientation was less organized. A manuscript describing this effort was published during the past year. Over the past year, the first subjects were enrolled in a clinical protocol to examine cardiovascular and pulmonary risk factors in adults with achondroplasia. The HGIMS has also maintained the Skeletal Gene Database, a publicly available electronic resource cataloguing all genes and expressed sequences found in skeletal tissue, and all known associations between genes and disease states or traits affecting the skeletal system.\",\n",
       " 'This study examines the clinical and molecular effects of heritable disorders of connective tissue including Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and Stickler syndrome, as well as related disorders such as familial aneurysm syndromes and fibromuscular dysplasia. To date, approximately 200 subjects have been enrolled in the study. The longitudinal arm of the study enrolls subjects 12 years and above, and detailed cardiovascular information including echocardiograms, ECG, a 24 hour Holter study, and pulse wave velocity data is collected on each participant. Echocardiography analysis of patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome demonstrated a 30% incidence of aortic root dilation in this group of patients and a manuscript has been published describing previously unrecognized findings in this group of patients including impaired left ventricular relaxation, elongated cardiac silhouette, prominence of the right coronary artery, and increased incidence of elevated pulmonary pressures. Autonomic dysfunction with increased sympathetic tone and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia (POTS) has been documented in 30% of the subjects with EDS, based on frequency domain analysis of the Holter data as well as orthostatic blood pressure measurements. This data is currently being analyzed. Bone densitometry studies have shown osteoporosis and osteopenia are very common in the EDS and Marfan populations, and may be correlated with specific mutations. A manuscript describing these findings is in preparation. MRI studies of the cervical and lumbar spine are also collected on subjects. We have recently identified that approximately one third of patients have Chiari I malformations and more than 85% of the subjects have significant abnormalities pertaining to the spine including hernitated discs, spondylolisthesis, dural ectasia. A manuscript describing the association of Chiari I malformation with hereditary disorders of connective tissue has been submitted. The summary of spine findings will be presented at the upcoming American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) annual meeting as a platform presentation. We have noted previously unrecognized complications of EDS, including the development of rheumatoid arthritis in older persons with EDS (in 15% of our cohort), increased incidence of clinically significant sleep disorders, and a high prevalence of unfavorable lipid profiles as compared to NHANES averages in all age groups including the teenage EDS cohort. These findings will be presented at the ASHG 2006 meeting, and manuscripts are being prepared. We have identified a familial aneurysm syndrome with features resembling Marfan syndrome, Stickler syndrome and the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Affected persons have joint hypermobility, retinal detachments or vitreous degeneration in the eye, and mild craniofacial and skeletal features in addition to aortic aneurysm. Twenty one affected persons from two families have been identified and a 6000-SNP linkage analysis has been completed on the Illumina platform. The results indicate four regions with high LOD scores. Sequence analysis of these regions will be pursued in order to identify the causative mutation. Previous linkage analysis were negative for linkage to known regions that cause familial aneurysm syndromes or connective tissue disorder, so it is highly likely that a novel gene will be identified in these two families. A previously unrecognized hereditary disorder of connective tissue, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) with connective tissue features has been identified within subjects enrolled in the study in the last year. This group of patients have FMD of carotids, renal arteries, brain or coronary vessels, in addition to hypermobile joints, high myopia, abnormal scarring, and hyperextensible skin. Approximately fifty patients have been identified with this syndrome, and whole genome scans are planned on the DNA samples when all the subjects have been enrolled in the upcoming year. The identification of this syndrome will be presented at the 2006 ASHG as a platform presentation. Mutational analysis of the COL2A1 and COL11A1 genes for thirty nine subjects with Stickler syndrome has been completed and twenty novel mutations have been identified. A poster describing the genotype phenotype correlations will be presented at ASHG 2006, and a manuscript is in preparation. We plan the sequence the CSPG2 gene in the remaining 19 patients. This gene was recently implicated in the closely related Wagner syndrome and it is a strong candidate gene for Stickler syndrome patients without COL2A1 and COL11A1 mutations. If mutations in CSPG2 are identified, this opens the door for potential treatment of Stickler syndrome by targeting the pathway involved. We are also in the process of screening DNA samples from patients Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia for deletions of the Tenascin X (TNX) gene. This gene lies in the hypermutable RCCX module near the CYP21 gene encoding 21-hydroxylase, and has been implicated as a causative gene in patients with the hypermobile form of EDS. Approximately 30% of patients with CAH have large CYP21 deletions and it is suspected that many of them have deletions extending into TNX. Joint hypermobility and abnormal scarring has been observed in some of the patients, and we are investigating the clinical correlation of TNX deletions with these findings. The ultimate goal of the study is to develop strategies for the treatment of complications and morbidities of hereditary disorders of connective tissue, most significant of which are ruptured aneurysms and dissections. Efforts are underway utilizing fibroblast cultures obtained from affected patients to study and alter the pathways involved in these complications, such as the TGFB pathway. Fibroblasts are suitable for this approach since the genes involved have high levels of expression as evidenced by frequent skin abnormalities in the disorders involved, and a skin biopsy can be readily obtained in a minimally invasive fashion from affected subjects. In addition, collaborative work with Dr. Talan from Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science and Dr. Dietz at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions is focused on utilizing a mouse model of vascular EDS in developing treatment strategies.',\n",
       " 'Aberrant wound healing is a common problem in both the ambulatory and bedbound geriatric population. We have been studying wound healing in both in vitro and in vivo systems in an attempt to understand how the process may be altered in aging. We have found that fibroblasts produced an increase in the EDA+ isoform of fibronectin when they become senescent in culture. A similar approach could be used to characterize changes in fibronectin as wounds heal in vivo. We have also demonstrated an increase in the ratio of collagenase to collagen mRNA in fibroblasts cultured from healthy older donors compared with healthy young donors both at basal levels and after treatment with a tumor promoting agent. In vivo this altered homeostasis may predispose older individuals to develop wounds, and impair the healing process. It suggests that fibroblasts from the skin of the older donors may express some of the characteristics of cells aged in culture. Finally, we have developed an internal standard for quantitative PCR which will allow us to characterize the specific expression of collagenase I in biopsies of human skin obtained from chronic wounds.

       " 'A. Studies have been done to clarify the relationship between cell cycle regulation and DNA repair in hamster cells: 1) UV irradiation of G1-synchronized cells causes a dose-dependent, p53-independent delay of entry into S phase. UV irradiation of G2-synchronized cells also causes a dose- and time-dependent delay before passage into the subsequent G1 phase. 2) Repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers occurs with identical compartmentalization and equal efficiency during G1 and G2 phases. 3) An extended late S G2 arrest observed after S phase UV irradiation results in apoptosis. 4) Delays in completion of replication, extended G2 arrest, and apoptosis were caused by the persistence of UV-induced DNA damage. 5) UV-induced 6-4 photoproducts are a much greater hindrance to replication than pyrimidine dimers. 6) Transcription of ERCC1, a gene involved in DNA repair and recombination, is elevated in late S and G2 phases in comparison to other periods of the cell cycle. Other repair genes studied (XPB, XPD, and CS-B) appear to be expressed at the same level throughout the cell cycle. B. Preferential, gene specific DNA repair occurs at the nuclear matrix, where transcription also is maximal. There is no coupling between transcription and repair in ribosomal DNA. C. In resting human CD4 lymphocytes, there is little or no repair in the essential gene DHFR. In proliferating lymphocytes we find both transcription associated gene specific repair increases and gene specific repair of genes that are not transcribed. The latter result suggests a connection between repair efficiency and the replicative status of the cell or DNA region. D. The repair of an episomal extra chromosomal gene is less efficient than repair of an endogenous gene. ',\n",
       " \" of work: Werner's syndrome (WS) is a homozygous recessive disease characterized by early onset of many characteristics of normal aging, such as wrinkling of the skin, graying of the hair, cataracts, diabetes, and osteoporosis. The symptoms of WS begin to appear around the age of puberty, and most patients die before age 50. Because of the acceleration of aging in WS, the study of this disease will hopefully shed light on the degenerative processes that occur in normal aging. Cells from WS patients grow more slowly and senescence at an earlier population doubling than age-matched normal cells, possibly because these cells appear to lose the telomeric ends of their chromosomes at an accelerated rate. In general, WS cells have a high level of genomic instability, with increased amounts of DNA deletions, insertions, and rearrangements. These effects could potentially be the result of defects in DNA repair, replication, and or recombination, although the actual biochemical defect remains unknown. The gene that is defective in WS, the WRN gene, has been identified and characterized. We have made purified WRN protein for use in a number of basic and complex biochemical assays. We are pursuing several avenues to identify and characterize the biochemical defect in WS cells. WRN protein has helicase activity and will unwind small and large DNA duplex constructs. It will also unwind unusual DNA structures such as triple helices and DNA forks. We are comparing the Werner helicase activity to that of another helicase, BLM, which is mutated in Bloom syndrome. WRNp has another enzymatic activity, a 3-5' exonuclease function. We are searching for pathways in which WRN participates and have discovered a number of new functional and physical protein interactions with Werner protein. Our data strongly suggest that WRN is involved in two of the major DNA repair pathways: base excision repair and recombination. This conclusion is supported by biochemical studies of protein functional interaction and increasingly also by cell biological data. Further, our observations and results from other work suggest that a major function of WRN is at the telomere end. WRN interacts with a number of key telomeric proteins such as TRF1 and 2 and POT1. These observations of functional protein interactions corroborated by cell biological observations suggest that WRN protein is involved in DNA repair processes and maintenance at the telomere end.\",\n",
       " 'Oxidative lesions are removed from DNA primarily via the base excision repair (BER) pathway. BER is carried out through four enzymatic steps, but is now clear that several other proteins modulate BER efficiency through protein-protein interactions. We and others identified several protein interactions for the core BER enzymes. These protein interactions are physical and functional and together support the \"passing of baton\" model, in which BER takes place in different steps supported by individual protein interactions that are components of a repair complex, possibly situated at the DNA lesion. Interestingly, these include two proteins associated with premature aging disorders, the Cockayne syndrome (CS) complementation group B gene (CSB) and the Werner syndrome gene (WRN). In CS cells, there are deficiencies in the repair of oxidative DNA damage in the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, and this may be a major underlying cause of the disease. We found that CSB-deficient cells accumulate oxidized bases, 8-hydroxyguanine and 8-hydroxyadenine, after oxidative stress, consistent with the observation that CSB and oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), the major DNA glycosylase for 8-oxoG repair, are in a complex in vivo. We also found that the CSB protein physically interacts with the Nei-like DNA glycosylase, NEIL1, which is also involved in the repair of oxidized bases. This interaction significantly stimulates NEIL1 catalytic activities, both the glycosylase as well as the AP-lyase. The observation that CSB-deficient mice accumulate significantly higher levels of several oxidized DNA bases in brain tissue, including fapyadenine and fapyguanine, supports a role for the CSB protein in the removal of oxidized lesions in vivo. It is notewhorty that Fapy lesions are considered canonical substrates for NEIL1, underscoring the biolgical relevance for this protein interaction. We recently demonstrated that the CSB protein also interacts with PARP1, a protein involved in the early steps of single-strand break repair, and that these two proteins cooperate in the cellular responses to oxidative stress. CSB is a substrate for PARP-1 ribosylation and it is likely that these two proteins function together in the process of base excision. Our results indicate that the CSB protein plays an important role in the repair of oxidative DNA damage and that accumulation of unrepaired lesions, particular in target tissues, like the brain, may be relevant to the CS pathology, which is characterized by severe early onset neurodegeneration. Moreover, we have identified a novel catalytic activity of the CSB protein. Despite having 7 conserved helicase domains (characteristic of the SWI SNF protein family), the only identified catalytic activity of CSB was ATP hydrolysis. We found that CSB efficiently catalyzes the annealing of two complementary strands of DNA. We are now mapping this novel activity to gain a better understanding of its biological relevance. Repair of 8-oxoG is of special interest since this lesion is believed to be highly mutagenic and accumulates with age. We find that OGG1 interacts with and can be phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase cdk4. This post-translational modification modulates OGG1 catalytic activity, suggesting a role for signaling pathways in the response to oxidative DNA damage. We are studying other protein interactions of OGG1 in order to understand how repair of oxidative lesions is regulated in vivo. We find that OGG1 also interacts with the recombination protein RAD52, suggesting a possible interplay between these two repair pathways. We find a reciprocal functional interaction between these two proteins, in which RAD52 stimulates OGG1 catalytic activity and OGG1 inhibits RAD52-catalysed DNA strand annealing and invasion. Moreover, the physical interaction between OGG1 and RAD52 increases in cells exposed to oxidative stress, indicating that this interaction is important in the cellular response to oxidative DNA damage. We have recently shown that the WRN protein also interacts physically and functionally with several BER proteins, including polymerase b, flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1), AP endonuclease (APE) and NEIL-1. We find that WRN strongly stimulates FEN-1 incision, pol b strand displacement activity and NEIL1 glycosylase activity. Further support for a role of WRN in BER comes from our observation that the levels of at least three different oxidative lesions, 8-oxoG, FapyG and FapyA, are significantly elevated in DNA from WRN-deficient cells and that long-patch BER activity is decreased in extracts from cells in which WRN expression is decreased by RNAi. Our results support a model in which WRN promotes long-patch BER by stimulating pol b strand displacement.',\n",
       " 'Double strand breaks are very dangerous lesions in DNA and must be repaired to allow cells to complete replication and transcription. Cells with deficiencies in double strand break repair are subject to genomic instability and individuals with these deficiencies are often at elevated risk of cancer. The presence of double strand breaks can be determined by examining cells for the phosphorylated form of a histone protein variant known as H2AX. Phosphorylation of the protein occurs rapidly in the vicinity of a double strand break, and persists until the break is repaired. Consequently phospho-H2AX serves a surrogate marker for breaks. This species can be easily detected by immunofluorescence techniques, and thus can be detected in single cells. We are testing the hypothesis that double strand breaks are presented in elevated levels in cells from aged individuals, as compared with younger individuals, by determining the level of phospho-H2AX in blood derived cells from donors in the BLSA program.',\n",
       " 'Aerobic organisms are constantly exposed to endogenous and exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS). Endogenous ROS include hydroxyl radicals that are produced predominantly as byproducts of normal cellular metabolism and through leakage of electrons during the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The interaction of ROS with the cellular genome often results in oxidatively induced DNA damage that includes; DNA base and sugar modifications, DNA-protein cross-links, abasic sites, single-strand breaks (SSB) and double-strand breaks (DSB). One of the most common oxidatively induced DNA base modifications is 8-OH-G which mispairs with adenine during DNA replication causing GC-TA transversion mutations. To maintain proper genetic integrity and to minimize cancer risk, organisms ranging from E. coli to humans have evolved elaborate mechanisms for repairing 8-OH-G. The E. coli MutT, MutM, and MutY pathways provide efficient repair of 8-OH-G. MutT and its human homologue hMTH is an 8-OH-GTpase that cleanses the nucleotide pool of 8-OH-GTP thus preventing its incorporation into the DNA during DNA replication. MutY and its human homolog hMYH is a monofunctional DNA glycosylase that removes adenine opposite 8-OH-G. MutM (Fpg) is a DNA glycosylase AP lyase that specifically removes 8-OH-G opposite cytosine. In humans, 8-OH-G is repaired predominantly by hOGG1, a DNA glycosylase AP lyase that is specific for 8-OH-G and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyG) opposite cytosine via the base excision repair (BER) pathway. There is a growing body of literature associating oxidative DNA damage with cancer. This includes work showing that the level of hydroxyl radical-induced DNA damage is increased in DNA of invasive ductal breast carcinoma tissues relative to normal breast tissue, implicating 8-OH-G repair in breast cancer development. Olinski and coworkers have also shown that free-radical-induced DNA damage is elevated in chromatin of various surgically removed cancerous tissues from the colon, stomach, ovary, brain and lung relative to the surrounding non-cancerous tissues. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of women at high risk of developing breast cancer were shown to be deficient in the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage. Furthermore, mitochondrial extracts of breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 are defective in the repair of 8-OH-G. To date the causes of the defective repair in these cancer cell lines remains unresolved. We analyzed the ability of HCC1937 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells to repair this lesion relative to the nonmalignant human mammary epithelial cell line, AG11134. We show that HCC1937 cells have diminished nuclear repair of 8-OH-G relative to AG11134 and have no detectable hOGG1. Nuclear DNA of HCC1937 and MCF-7 cells accumulated higher levels of 8-hydroxyl-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-d-G) after H2O2 treatment followed by a repair period compared to AG11134 cells. The deficient repair is not associated with a genetic change in the hOGG1 gene since the coding and the promoter regions of this gene did not harbor any mutations. Repair of 8-OH-G in HCC1937 cells was significantly stimulated by purified hOGG1. Furthermore, expression of hOGG1 by transfection of the hOGG1 gene in HCC1937 cells resulted in increased repair of 8-OH-G. HCC1937 cells had significant upregulation of SOD1 and SOD2 and exhibited reduced clonogenic survival after oxidative stress. This study provides evidence for inefficient in vivo and in vitro repair of 8-OH-G in HCC1937 human breast cancer cells and directly implicates hOGG1 in this defect.',\n",
       " ' of work: Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare human disease that is characterized by arrested post-natal growth and resulted in premature aging and death. Cells from CS individuals are abnormally sensitive to killing by ultraviolet radiation as well as certain so-called UV-mimetic chemicals, such as 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene. This cellular phenotype prompted extensive studies on the ability of CS cells to carry out nucleotide excision repair both in intact cells and in cell-free systems. Most conventional assays, including the use a cell-free system that supports transcription-independent nucleotide excision repair, indicate no defect in CS cells. However, CS cells are defective in the enhanced rate of repair of the template (transcribed) strand relative to the coding (non-transcribed) strand of transcriptionally active genes. In recent experiments from this laboratory we have demonstrated that mutations in the CSB gene are the cause of the transcription coupled repair defect. In hamster cells homologous to CSB we can transfect with a normal CSB gene and complement the repair defect. The mechanism of TCR in eukaryotes remains to be elucidated, and the CSB protein appears. These observations and discovery of dual function of transcription factor II H (TFIIH) in transcription and DNA repair, led to the \"transcriptional hypothesis\" which postulates that transcription defects are the underlying basis for the pathology in some human diseases including Cockayne syndrome. In this laboratory we were interested to test this hypothesis experimentally, and we have demonstrated the reduced level of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription in intact and permeabilized CS-B cells. The molecular mechanism responsible for this deficiency was further investigated in a cell-free system. We utilized in vitro transcription assay and determine Pol II transcription activity in extracts prepared from different CS cell lines in comparison to extracts prepared from normal cells. We found that in vitro transcription is CS extracts is highly sensitive to minor damages in template DNA arising during purification. This deficiency may be complemented by transfection of a CS-B cell line with normal CSB gene. Studies of transcription in vitro in a plasmid based system demonstrate a significant transcription defect in CSB cells. This defect may be related to oxidation damage or structural changes in the DNA which somehow affects the transcription in CSB cells but not in normal cells. Experiments in intact cells also demonstrate a defect in basal transcription which can be complemented by transfection with the normal CSB gene. Further, these experiments suggest that CSB cells may have a defect in the assembly of the higher order chromatin structural organization in conjunction with transcription and DNA repair. This is supported by the observation that CSB chromatin is much more sensitive to detergent than normal chromatin. ',\n",
       " 'A correlation between a genetic defect in DNA repair and lack of hypermutation would be very significant, since there are no in vivo models to study mutation. Three knockout lines of mice have been obtained: PMS2 and MSH2 mismatch repair mice, and XPA nucleotide excision repair mice. Homozygous (- -) knockout and littermate (+ +) mice are being immunized, and DNA will be prepared from B cells. Endogenous Vx and VH genes are being amplified by PCR, cloned, and sequenced. The frequency of mutation in the V and constant genes from knockout and control mice are compared. Preliminary results show different patterns of mutation in normal and mismatch repair deficient mice. Hybridoma cells were irradiated with ultraviolet light. The cells were then grown in vitro and harvested at different time points. DNA was prepared, and incubated with restriction enzymes and T4 endonuclease, which cleaves thymine dimers. Cleaved DNA was separated by gel electrophoresis, and different genes were identified by Southern blot analysis. Current results suggest that V genes have a slower rate of repair than the dihydrofolate reductase gene. ',\n",
       " 'One theory of the mechanism of aging of post-mitotic tissues proposes that an accumulation of oxidative damage to cell components leads to a decline in cell function and ultimately, death. The major source of oxidative stress, in the form of oxygen radicals, is mitochondrial respiration and one particularly provocative form of this theory of aging suggests that oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA) gives rise to deletions and other mutations, which accumulate during the many cycles of mitochondrial division that occur during the lifetime of a myocyte or neurone, eventually giving rise to a failure in mitochondrial energy transduction. This project examines both aspects of this suggested mechanism, viz mitochondrial production of oxygen radicals (ROS) and the accrual of oxidative damage to mitochondria. This year we have characterized the production of H2O2 by isolated rat heart mitochondria. We have shown that it is relatively active with succinate as oxidizable substrate, much less so with pyruvate, glutamate and other NAD-linked substrates. Rates of H2O2 formation correlate closely with the degree of energization of the mitochondrial inner membrane, measured as the membrane potential 2, and with the fractional reduction of mitochondrial NAD. Contrary to literature findings, the main generator of H2O2 is Complex I (NADH-coenzyme Q-oxidoreductase). Supplementation with Mn2+ strongly potentiates H2O2 formation, possibly via activation of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD). Comparison of cardiac mitochondria from young adults (6 month old) and senescent (24 month-old) rats indicated no change in the activity of H2O2 generation. ',\n",
       " ' of work: Recently, it was demonstrated (Prashad et al.) that cells from patients with familial Alzheimer disease (AD) had an altered response to fluorescent light (FL) exposure as compared to cells from unaffected individuals, suggesting that there may be some deficiency in the DNA repair processing of oxidative lesions induced by FL in AD. This project was initiated to develop a better understanding of the DNA repair capacity of AD for FL induced lesions. The formation and repair of oxidative base lesions in AD and normal fibroblasts was measured after exposure to FL using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS) analysis. Several oxidative DNA lesions were induced in AD and normal cells by exposure to FL. The oxidative lesions induced by FL exposure include 5-hydroxycytosine, formamidopyrimidine, and 8-hydroxy guanine. Additionally, the capacity of AD cells to repair oxidative DNA damage is being investigated using an in vitro DNA repair synthesis assay. In vitro DNA repair synthesis was carried out by whole cell extracts from AD and normal cells on plasmid DNA damaged by gamma-irradiation. This substrate was repaired efficiently by whole cell extracts from both AD and normal cells. Similar in vitro assays using plasmid DNA damaged by various oxidative sources are currently in progress.

       " 'We are developing a gene targeting program based on oligonucleotides that form stable triple helix complexes with specific sequences in duplex DNA. This approach has the promise to become a simple and efficient technology for delivering DNA reactive compounds to specific sites in chromosomal DNA in living cells. Applications include gene knockout, directed gene conversion and recombination, and, perhaps, gene therapy. We have prepared TFOs containing novel sugar analogues and have identified a modification format that supports efficient targeting of specific chrosomal sequences in living mammalian cells. In our developmental work we prepared TFOs, linked to a photoactive DNA mutagen, directed against a sequence in a gene (HPRT) frequently used as a mutation reporter. We introduced this into mammalian cells and, after photoactivation of the mutagen, isolated colonies of cells with mutations in the target gene. Sequence analysis showed that the mutations were located at the target sequence within the gene. Treatment of S phase cells with these TFOs resulted in targeted crosslinking in 30% of the cells and 5-10% mutation frequencies. Both crosslinking and mutagenesis were much lower in quiescent cells. These results indicate that the accessibility of chromosomal target sites in mammalian cells is modulated by the biology of the cell. This strategy has been extended to other genes for which genetic analyses of targeting are not possible. For example, we have recently shown, using a biochemical assay, that a site in the human beta globin gene can be targeted at high efficiency. Additional analyses of the oligonucleotide chemistry required for bioactivity revealed that the active TFOs contain a balance of modifications, too much or too little reduces activity.',\n",
       " 'Helicases are molecular motor proteins that couple the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphate to nucleic acid unwinding. Enzymes of this class function coordinately with other proteins as a complex machine and play essential roles in pathways of DNA metabolism that include replication, DNA repair, recombination, transcription, and chromosome segregation. Despite considerable efforts to understand biochemical, structural, and genetic aspects of helicase function, the precise mechanisms by which helicases catalyze strand separation and perform their biological roles remain to be fully understood. The growing number of DNA helicases implicated in human disease suggests that these enzymes have vital specialized roles in cellular pathways important for the maintenance of genome stability. Recent evidence indicates that mutations in genes of the RecQ family of DNA helicases result in chromosomal instability diseases of premature aging and or cancer predisposition. Currently known RecQ helicase-deficient disorders include Werner, Bloom, and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes. The WRN gene product, defective in Werner syndrome, is a helicase exonuclease that presumably functions in DNA metabolism to preserve genome integrity. To understand the DNA structures and cellular pathways that WRN impacts, we have systematically examined the DNA substrate preferences of WRN helicase for unwinding and its interactions with human nuclear proteins. Our biochemical studies indicate that WRN preferentially unwinds DNA replication structures in a defined orientation and utilizes specific DNA structural elements for recognition. A real-time kinetic analysis of WRN helicase activity was used by our group to characterize the mechanism of DNA unwinding by WRN. Biochemical studies were performed to investigate the mechanism for stimulation of WRN helicase activity by its auxiliary factor RPA. Our results indicate that the physical interaction between RPA and WRN plays a critical role in the functional interaction. To further understand the molecular functions of WRN protein, we have characterized the functional interaction of WRN with human Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN-1), a structure-specific nuclease implicated in DNA repair, replication, and recombination. Our results indicate that WRN stimulates FEN-1 cleavage of important DNA intermediates by a unique mechanism whereby the efficiency of FEN-1 cleavage is dramatically enhanced. Our most recent work has elucidated a role for WRN in resolving stalled replication forks and recombination intermediates. Our hypothesis is that the aberrant mitotic recombination and genomic instability arises from inappropriate processing of replication recombination intermediates in Werner syndrome cells. In vivo evidence for a role of WRN in cellular DNA replication was attained using a model genetic system for WRN structure-function studies. Although the biochemical properties and protein interactions of the WRN and BLM helicases have been extensively investigated, less information is available concerning the functions of the other human RecQ helicases. We have focused our attention on human RECQ1, a DNA helicase whose cellular functions remain largely uncharacterized. RECQ1 was found to stably bind a variety of DNA structures, enabling it to unwind a diverse set of DNA substrates. RECQ1 was shown to catalyze efficient strand annealing between complementary single-stranded DNA molecules. To acquire a better understanding of RECQ1 cellular functions, we have investigated its protein interactions. Our results suggest a role of RECQ1 in regulation of genetic recombination by its interaction with mismatch repair factors. Currently, we are utilizing model systems to determine the biological functions of RECQ1.',\n",
       " 'Accumulation of CD28-CD8+ T cells that are defective in response to antigenic stimulation is a hallmark of age-associated decline in T cell function. However, the underlying mechanism of this age-associated change is not fully understood. We recently analyzed the global gene expression profiles of CD8+ T cell subsets from nave to memory (CD28+ to CD28-) cells and the growth of CD28+ and CD28- CD8+ memory T cells in response to homeostatic cytokine interleukin 15 (IL-15). At the gene expression level, one of the most striking changes is the altered expression of some co-stimulatory receptors and various NK cell receptors in CD28-CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, CD28-CD8+ T cells appear to have a normal proliferation response to IL-15 in vitro. Interestingly, IL-15 is also capable of inducing stable loss of CD28 expression in actively dividing CD28+CD8+ memory T cells. Together, these findings provide the gene expression features of CD28-CD8+ T cells that differ from their CD28+ counterparts and suggest a possible role of IL-15 in the increase of CD28-CD8+ T cells that occurs with aging. Caregivers of Alzheimers disease (AD) patients endure chronic stress associated with a decline of immune function. To assess the psychological and immunological changes of caregivers, we compared depressive symptoms, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) composition, in vitro activation induced proliferation and cytokine production, and telomere length and telomerase activity of 82 individuals (41 caregivers and 41 age- and gender-matched controls). We found depressive symptoms were significantly higher in caregivers than in controls (p<0.001). Correspondingly, caregivers had significantly lower T cell proliferation but higher production of immune-regulatory cytokines (TNF- and IL-10) than controls in response to stimulation in vitro. We examined the impact of these changes on cellular replicative lifespan and found that caregivers had significantly shorter telomere lengths in PBMC than controls (6.2 and 6.4 Kb, respectively, p<0.05) with similar shortening in isolated T cells and monocytes and that this telomere attrition in caregivers was not due to an increase of shorter telomere possessing T cell subsets in PBMC. Finally, we showed that basal telomerase activity in PBMC and T cells was significantly higher in caregivers than in controls (p<0.0001), pointing to an unsuccessful attempt of cells to compensate the excessive loss of telomeres in caregivers. These findings demonstrate that chronic stress is associated with altered T-cell function and accelerated immune cell aging as suggested by excessive telomere loss.',\n",
       " 'Differentiation of naive CD8 T cells to memory cells after antigenic stimulation is an essential process for establishing long lasting protective immunity against viruses, intracellular bacteria, and tumors. During this differentiation process, memory CD8 T cells acquire novel properties that are distinct from their naive CD8+ T cell precursors, including the ability to mount a rapid and robust response upon antigen re-encounter. Substantial progress has been made in the past decade in understanding the phenotypic and functional characteristics of naive and memory CD8 T cells. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the enhanced responsiveness of memory T cells are unknown. To understand the molecular basis for the rapid and robust memory T cell responses, we analyzed gene expression profile at the whole genome scale of naive and memory CD8 T cells. Overall, we identified seventy-two genes or transcripts that were differentially expressed in memory CD8 T cells and twenty-one genes and transcripts that were differentially expressed in naive CD8 T cells from assessing over 30,000 unique genes and transcripts Based on their known functions, these differentially expressed genes were further divided into six groups: 1) Cell adhesion, 2) Cell proliferation, 3) Signal transduction, 4) Immune response, 5) Structure and metabolism, and 6) Regulation of transcription. Together, these findings provide a transcriptional basis for some unique features of memory CD8 T cells; although the roles of the majority of those memory cell differentially expressed genes in memory cell response remain to be determined. To further elucidate the basis for differential gene expression, we assessed the role of histone H3K9 acetylation (H3K9) in differential gene expression. Strikingly, higher H3K9 acetylation levels were detected in resting memory cells, prior to their activation, for those genes that were differentially expressed following activation, indicating that hyperacetylation of histone H3K9 may play a role the selective and rapid gene expression of memory CD8+ T cells. Consistent with this model, we showed that inducing high levels of H3K9 acetylation resulted in an increased expression in naive cells of those genes that are normally expressed differentially in memory cells. Together, these findings suggest that differential gene expression mediated at least in part by histone H3K9 hyperacetylation may be responsible for the rapid and robust memory CD8+ T cell response.',\n",
       " 'Inflammatory cytokines released by immune cells have been shown to act on the central nervous system (CNS) to control food intake and energy homeostasis. Decrease in food intake or anorexia is one of the most common symptoms of illness, injury or inflammation. The adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin, is considered a critical sensory anorexigenic mediator that signals to the brain changes in stored energy, determined by an altered balance between food intake and energy expenditure and has been shown to exert certain proinflammatory effects on immune cells. In contrast, ghrelin, the endogenous ligand for growth hormone secretagogue receptors (GHS-R), is produced primarily from stomach serving as a potent circulating orexigen controlling energy expenditure, adiposity and GH secretion. However, the functional role of ghrelin and GHS in immune cell function is unknown. Here, we report that GHS-R and ghrelin are expressed in human T lymphocytes, specifically localize in GM1-associated lipid rafts, exerts both specific and potent inhibitory effects on the TCR- and leptin-mediated expression of the proinflammatory cytokines via functional GHS-R and possible a novel GHS receptor on the surface of human mononuclear and T cells. Moreover, ghrelin administration into endotoxin challenged mice significantly inhibits inflammatory cytokine protein and mRNA expression in the serum and various organs. Furthermore, the expression of ghrelin, leptin and their receptors as well as GH appear to be significantly diminished with age within specific immune subsets and lymphoid organs, including the thymus. Administration of ghrelin, GH and leptin into aged mice using implanted osmotic pumps resulted in a partial reversal of thymic involution and restored thymic GH and IGF1 expression. Infusion of ghrelin, leptin or GH into old mice significantly improves the age-associated changes in thymic architecture and thymocyte counts along with an increase in recent thymic emigrants (RTE), an improvement of TCR diversity of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and enhanced numbers of early thymocyte progenitors (ETP) and bone marrow-derived lineage negative sca-1, c-kit high (LSK) cells. Furthermore, the ghrelin and GHS-R deficient mice displayed enhanced age-associated thymic involution with reduced thymopoiesis, contraction of LSKs and major perturbations in the TCR repertoire of peripheral T lymphocytes. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for ghrelin and its receptor in thymic biology and T cell development. Moreover, our laboratory and others have demonstrated that the pituitary hormones, prolactin and human growth hormone, as well as insulin growth factor-1 (IGF1) potentiate human and rodent lymphocyte activation and proliferation in response to various antigens and stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. These hormones have also been shown to modulate a variety of leukocyte functions including potentiating lymphocyte activation and thymic engraftment and regeneration. Together, these data support the existence of a functional immunoregulatory network involving orexigenic and anorexigenic hormones that appear to play a significant role in cytokine regulation, cellular activation and survival. These data also support the potential therapeutic use of ghrelin and GHS-R agonists in the management of wasting associated with chronic inflammation and cancer and in restoration of thymic function in immunocompromised individuals.',\n",
       " 'Alzheimers disease (AD) affects over 4 million people in the US each year. The molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of this disease have not yet been elucidated and it is likely that these changes begin well before detectable cognitive impairment occurs. In this study, we examined tissue sliced from the inferior parietal cortex of 4 AD patients by microarray analysis, and compared the data obtained to similar experiments from patients presenting with non-AD related dementia, using pooled, age-matched control patients as a reference. Experiments were run on whole-genome Agilent 44k oligomer arrays, subjected to z-transformation and analyzed by using distance-based gene selection criteria. By performing this type of analysis, we were able to identify changes specific to AD and not simply those that result from the acquisition of changes characteristic to neurodegeneration. AD patients were matched for similar levels of neuritic plaques (P) and neurofibrilatory tangles (T), indicative of their levels of neurodegeneration. Each of the Alzheimers, Parkinsons or other dementia patients was run as an individual sample, and not as pooled RNA. The results from this small pool of AD patients were expanded to a larger set of twelve AD patients using real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting. We found that the major groups of differentially expressed genes included genes involved in nervous system development, and neurological disease, and the major signaling pathways affected were heavily biased towards those involved in immune signaling. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the most significant group of differentially expressed genes related to immune related functions include IL-6, IL-8 and IL-28A and to nervous system development and neurological diseases (e.g., aquaporin, FMR1, ECEs). Gene expression between samples was confirmed using real time RT-PCR and Western analysis as well as immunohistological examination of tissue sections. Overall, we believe that both common and distinct biochemical and molecular pathways are involved in both acute and chronic neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory processes. Understanding the commonality between these various pathways may provide valuable information into the diagnosis and control of these disease states.',\n",
       " 'Besides chemotaxis, C-X-C and C-C chemokines function as mediators in T-cell activation and in many lymphocyte biological responses. Detailed information about downstream signaling pathways is necessary to understand the role of chemokines in normal physiology and inflammation. We have built several focused cDNA chips containing approximately 3000 known human genes that are expressed and secreted by a variety of cell types including lymphoid cells and participate in cell growth, signal transduction, effector functions, CD molecules, metabolism and apoptosis. Additional studies using 44K oligonucleotide arrays are underway examining the ability of various chemokines, HIV-1 viral isolates, and gp120 proteins to directly induce gene expression in young and old human T lymphocytes. We are currently verifying and characterizing several gene families that are highly expressed in T cells after migration in response to or simply stimulation with SDF-1, MIP-3beta, gp120 and HIV-1 virus. A greater understanding of the transcriptional signals differentially induced by the ligation of various chemokine receptors may provide a means to dissect the pathways by which these chemoattractants induce cell migration and activation as well as any host transcriptional signals important in HIV entry and replication.',\n",
       " \"Homocysteine (Hcy) is the immediate precursor of the amino acid, methionine. In humans, blood concentrations of Hcy may become elevated as a result of deficiency in folate, vitamin B6 or vitamin B12 and has recently been identified as a putative risk factor for a number of age-associated disease states including arteriosclerosis, myocardial infarction, arterial occlusive disease, Alzheimer's disease and neural tube defects. A specific role for Hcy or any of its metabolites, such as S-adenosyl Hcy (SAH) or Hcy thiolactone, in these conditions has not yet been firmly established. Particularly absent is a description of the effects of elevated Hcy levels on immune function. Several studies have examined the effects of Hcy on monocyte, neutrophil and B cell function, inflammation and chemokine production; however, little is known about the Hcy effects on T lymphocytes. Our initial studies revealed that treatment of resting and activated human and murine T cells with Hcy (100-1000 micromolar) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic cell death. D, L Hcy was more potent than Hcy thiolactone in this respect while SAH was found to be significantly less active. We also found that the pro-apoptotic effects of Hcy were abrogated with the addition of serum, pan-caspase inhibitors, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors to the cell cultures. These results suggest that D, L-Hcy, like other apoptotic stressors, leads to the activation of the caspase cascade and eventually to the cleavage of the key cellular proteins, like PARP, the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, DNA fragmentation, and eventually leading to the typical morphological changes observed in cells undergoing apoptosis. We have also found that Hcy-mediated apoptosis is inhibited by the phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, the intracellular calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, and the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Moreover, we have also found that Hcy appears to potentiate cellular death induced by a number of other established apoptotic signals including activation-induced cell death (AICD), heat shock, and Fas ligand- and HIV-mediated T cell death. Finally, we have also observed that in vivo infusion of D, L Hcy but not SAH induces thymic involution with a dramatic reduction in cell numbers and thymic weights. The specific role of Hcy in age- or disease-associated involution remains to be defined. In addition to the pro-apoptotic effects of Hcy, stimulation of mononuclear cells or highly-purified human or murine T cells with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb in the presence of Hcy or thiolactone but not SAH resulted in a significant increase in several type 1 cytokines including IL-2, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-10 but not the type 2 cytokines, IL-4 or IL-5. These effects were also observed upon in vivo infusion of Hcy and within folate deficient mouse models. A more detailed examination of the Hcy effects on T cell activation revealed that this type 1 cytokine production profile is partially mediated through the production of IL-18, IL-12, and nitric oxide. Moreover, D, L-Hcy but not SAH treatment also resulted in the demethylation of the IFN-gamma promoter permitting the binding of phosphorylated CREB. Given the potent effects of Hcy on methylation, these results may not seem surprising; however, a more detailed analysis of the direct induction of methyltransferase activity or indirect effects through other mediators and signals needs to be defined. The precise mechanism involved in the generation of these cytokines is currently under investigation but we believe the Hcy effect is being mediated, in part, by specific stress-associated signals post Hcy treatment. Detailed cytokine promoter analysis is currently underway to address the effects of Hcy on transcription factor induction and activation. Overall, Hcy appears to exert a number of differential effects on immune cells, which may alter immune function in the circulation and tissue microenvironment with age and disease pathology. A greater understanding of the potential modulatory effects of Hcy and its metabolites on immune function may result in the development of potential therapeutic strategies to control and optimize immune responses with age, AIDS and in various age-associated disease states.\",\n",
       " 'One of the consequences of an aging immune system is the process of thymic involution. The thymus undergoes a progressive reduction in size due to profound changes in its architecture associated with thymic epithelia atrophy and decreased thymopoiesis. This decline is systemically followed by decreased numbers of circulating naive T cells and cell-mediated immune responses which may play a role in the increased tumorigenesis, autoimmunity, and infectious diseases observed within an aging host. Despite the extensive study of the pathophysiology of the aging thymus, the precise molecular mechanism involved in the involution process remains unclear. In an effort to profile molecular changes that occur within the aging thymus, microarray analysis was performed using RNA derived from thymus isolated from mice of varying ages. Using mRNA derived from the thymi of 2, 4, 6, 12 and 18 month old BALB c mice, microarray analysis was performed using three distinct custom-made cDNA microarrays developed within our laboratory as well as 22K oligonucleotide murine arrays. The success of this project relies upon the reliability of the molecular profiling aged cells from defined aged sources, both from culture and freshly isolated aged cells. The first milestone will be the definitive characterization and selection of genes associated with thymic involution. We have performed a series analysis of gene expression in the thymi and spleens of mice of varying ages and have initiated studies examining expression differences in mice of distinct H-2 and genetic backgrounds as well as known involution mouse models. Our current data would suggest that thymic involution may be strain- and gender-dependent and may in part be associated with distinct nutritional and stress-related factors rather than simply aging. A number of genes associated with DNA repair, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation were found to be significantly upregulated with thymic aging. We are currently analyzing the data obtained from the gene profiles of aged spleens, thymi, bone marrow, immune cell subsets and thymocytes from mice of various ages given ad libitum or caloric restricted diets as well as from aged mice infused with GH, ghrelin, leptin and interleukin-7. We have recently found that ghrelin and leptin infusions reverse age-associated thymic involution. Array analysis of the thymi of such treated mice may yield valuable data on the common molecular processes involved in thymic regeneration. It is unclear whether certain lymphoid organs or cellular components play a critical role in longevity and lifespan. The overall goal of this project is to produce a comprehensive gene expression profile in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes during the aging process to identify unique and common genes and functionally related groups of genes that are expressed in age-dependent manner in these different organ systems. We have initially focused our efforts on the thymus, as its involution is believed to be one of the most significant obstacles to overcome in addressing the immunological deficits associated with aging.',\n",
       " 'Chemokine receptors (CRs) have drawn much attention since their description as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-receptors by several groups in 1996. Prior to that time, HIV tropism was defined as either macrophage (M)- or T cell (T)-tropic, which corresponded to non-syncytia- or syncytia-inducing viruses, respectively. Today, the classification of HIV tropism is defined by chemokine receptor usage of CCR5, CXCR4, or both receptors. Chemokine receptors are a family of seven transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptors that are differentially expressed by a number of immune and non-immune cell populations. Certain CRs have been shown to be palmitoylated and targeted to cholesterol-and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains termed lipid rafts. Lipid rafts is a broad term for the collection of membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, and acylated signaling molecules. Lipid rafts are believed to be important signaling platforms enriched in many signaling proteins, including but not limited to src kinases, G alpha subunit, H-Ras, LAT, and NOS. CCR5 and CXCR4 have been shown to be present in lipid rafts, colocalizing at the leading edge of migrating cells. However, the role of cholesterol and these lipid rafts on T cell chemokine binding and signaling through CCR5 and CXCR4 remains unknown. We found that cholesterol extraction by beta-cyclodextrin (BCD) significantly reduced the binding and signaling of SDF-1 and MIP-1b using CXCR4- or CCR5-expressing T cells, respectively. Oxidized forms of cholesterol, known as oxysterols, are abundant in various food products and can be found naturally in membranes and mitochondria of a variety of cell types. Cholesterol oxidation was also found to result in the loss of chemokine binding and function in T cells and monocytes. Reloading treated cells with non-oxidized cholesterol restores chemokine binding and function in these situations. Antibodies specific for distinct CXCR4 or CCR5 epitopes lost their ability to bind to the cell surface after cholesterol extraction and cholesterol oxidation. Moreover, bindings studies with labeled chemokines have demonstrated extensive co-localization of ligand binding with the GM1 lipid raft marker while using anti-chemokine receptor antibodies, we found the majority of chemokine receptors co-localize with CD59 and only partially with GM1. These results suggest that active ligand binding facilitates receptor association with lipid rafts or that raft association promotes a higher affinity conformation of chemokine receptors. Together, these data demonstrate that cholesterol and lipid rafts are important for the maintenance of the chemokine receptor conformation and are necessary for both the binding and function of this chemokine receptor. This cholesterol and lipid raft requirement for ligand binding may play a significant physiological role in controlling immune cell signaling and migration. More specific efforts are also underway examining the differences in the make-up of lipid rafts within the cell membranes of young and aged lymphocytes. Given the large number of alterations in lipid and peroxidation and metabolism with age, changes in the types, saturation and levels of various membrane sphingolipids, fatty acids and cholesterol may result in specific changes in membrane fluidity, protein association and aggregation, cellular activation and function. In addition, through HPLC separation, 2-D gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy, additional studies are underway creating a proteomic expression profile of the various proteins within the lipid rafts of young and aged lymphocytes at various stages of activation. Additional studies over the past year have also revealed that flotillin-1 appears to play an important role in T cell receptor and chemokine receptor signaling and function and that CD8+ T cells express greater levels of cholesterol and lipid rafts than CD4+ T cells. Overall, we believe that a greater understanding of the various signaling and cell surface proteins associated with lipid rafts may provide great insight into age-related alterations in cell signaling and migration.',\n",
       " ':Our laboratory utilizes multiple techniques to determine the effects of age, gender and lifestyle habits on cardiovascular (CV) performance at rest and during exercise. (A) We examined whether age affects midwall systolic left ventricular (LV) performance, a more sensitive marker for determining myocardial dysfunction than standard endocardial measures. In 330 normal BLSA men (n=141) and women (n=189), those older than the median age of 50 years had smaller LV cavities, greater wall thickness, and higher endocardial fractional shortening than younger subjects. However, midwall shortening was not significantly age-related in either sex. Furthermore, the relationship between midwall shortening and end-systolic stress was similar in older versus younger groups. Thus, normative aging appears to have minimal effect on LV systolic performance whether measured at the LV endocardium or the midwall. (B) Longitudinal changes of maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) were determined in nearly 1,400 Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) volunteers without evident cardiac disease, using mixed effects statistical analysis. Per decade, longitudinal declines in VO2max were generally greater than cross-sectional declines, especially in older decades. Gender differences in both absolute VO2max and rates of decline (men>women) are markedly attenuated when VO2max was normalized for fat-free mass rather than body weight (Circulation. 2005;112(5):674-82). (C) The longitudinal decline in VO2max was determined in 42 older male endurance athletes, initially 64 (plus or minus) 6 years old. Over a mean follow-up of 7.8 years, VO2max declined by 22%, triple the decrease predicted by the baseline cross-sectional data. Within the overall sample, training status during follow-up had a major effect on the change in VO2max: the 6 men who continued to train vigorously had no significant decline in VO2max (0.28% yr.), the 20 that trained at a lower intensity declined by 2.6% yr, and the 14 who stopped training declined 4.6% yr. Thus, physical activity patterns have a major impact on the long-term changes in maximal aerobic capacity in older athletes. (D) Left ventricular thickness, mass and chamber dimensions were measured in 336 healthy, normotensive adults (mean age 56+ -18 years, 200 women, 136 men) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We found that the left ventricle becomes more spherical with age in normal adults because of reduced length. In women, this is associated with an increased wall thickness which offsets the decrease in length, resulting in left ventricular mass not changing with age. In men, wall thickness does not compensate for the increased sphericity, resulting in decreased left ventricular mass with age (Am J Cardiol 2002;90:1231-1236). (E) Ejection fraction (EF) acutely increases during exercise, but the EF reserve decreases with advancing age. EF is inversely related to the index of the interaction between arterial and ventricular properties, defined by the ratio of arterial elastance (EaI) to left ventricular systolic elastance (ELVI). We noninvasively characterized the arterial-ventricular coupling index EaI ELVI and its two determinants at rest and during graded exercise in 136 healthy men and 103 healthy women (age range 21-87 years) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We found that age-associated differences in EaI ELVI occur in both genders during exercise, with less optimal coupling in older compared to younger subjects, which may help to explain the age deficit in maximal exercise EF. We also found that the mechanisms underlying the sub-optimal coupling in older adults differed between men and women (J Am Coll Cardiol. 2004;44(3):611-617). (F)Diastolic heart failure is common in older women, often occurs following longstanding hypertension, and is characterized by reduced cardiovascular reserve during exercise. Recent insights suggest that arterial-ventricular coupling (AV-C), which is an important determinant of cardiovascular performance, may play an important role in the pathophysiology of diastolic heart failure. AV-C was measured at rest and with graded cycle ergometry in 142 normotensive and 35 hypertensive women free from overt cardiovascular disease. AV-C was 26% lower in hypertensive than normotensive women at rest. The AV-C reserve, calculated as the difference in AV-C between rest and peak exercise was also smaller in the hypertensive than normotensive women (0.2plus or minus 0.03 vs 0.28 plus or minus 0.01, p<0.001). Thus, examination of AV-C at rest and with exercise provides mechanistic insights into why hypertension may predispose older women to diastolic heart failure. (G) Although it is well established that evidence of coronary ischemia during treadmill exercise is associated with an increased likelihood of future coronary events (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction or death), even in clinically healthy populations, less is known about the prognostic significance of the absence of objective evidence of ischemia, as determined from electrocardiography (ECG), tomographic thallium scintigraphy, or both. We performed maximal treadmill exercise ECG and thallium scintigraphy (201Tl) in 697 asymptomatic volunteers (57% men) with no clinical history of coronary heart disease from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The average age was 62 plus or minus 12 years. 289 subjects had evidence of ischemia on the stress test: 193 had a positive ECG, and 175 a positive Tl201. Over a mean follow-up period of 6.7 years, cardiac events developed in 11% of subjects. Events occurred in 10% of individuals with a negative ECG, 8% of those with a negative 201Tl, and 7% of those with concordant negative 201Tl and ECG. After adjusting for age and other covariates, negative ECG was not associated (p=NS), whereas a negative 201Tl was weakly associated (hazard ratio=0.62, 95%CI 0.37-1.04, p=0.07) with the absence of future events. Concordant negative ECG and 201Tl was an independent predictor of freedom from events (hazard ratio=0.58, 95% CI 0.34-0.97, p=0.03), with a sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value of 62%, 61% and 93% respectively. Thus, in healthy individuals, the concordant absence of ischemia on both ECG and 201Tl provides independent prognostic information.',\n",
       " 'Intraarterial stents have become the primary therapy for treating coronary artery disease because they limit the elastic recoil and late vascular wall remodeling following angioplasty. Restenosis, in this case, is an iatrogenic complication of the additional arterial injury caused by stent placement itself, and evolves as a process by which vascular smooth muscle cells abnormally migrate and proliferate into the lumen of an artery following stent placement, causing obstruction to normal blood flow. Restenosis rates for patients undergoing stent placement procedures remain unacceptably high, resulting in clinical failure in up to 20-30% (and in some series, up to 40%) of patients by 6-9 months. Thus, the anticipated clinical impact of drug-coated stents that would prevent these cellular responses leading to restenosis and clinical failure is very significant. Based on our previous research which demonstrated that the anti-tumor drug, paclitaxel (Taxol), might have clinical promise to prevent vascular restenosis (Sollott et al, J Clin Invest 1995;95(4):1869-76), we examined whether paclitaxel-coated coronary stents would be effective at preventing neointimal proliferation in a porcine model of restenosis. We found that paclitaxel-coated coronary stents produced a significant dose-dependent inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia and luminal encroachment in the pig LAD coronary artery 28 days after implantation, without any significant complications (i.e., no aneurysm, thrombosis, or death) (Heldman et al. Circulation 2001;103(18):2289-95). The long-term studies (6-9 month outcomes) are currently in progress and continue to show that the entire range of doses tested is safe. The dose-efficacy assessment is still in progress. From these latest studies it is now becoming clear that there is the early restoration of several critical aspects of normal vascular architecture and health, including complete regrowth and relining of the artery by endothelial cells (a major positive anatomic and clinical benchmark of vascular healing) at paclitaxel doses that are emerging from these studies as likely to be the most efficacious. The development of restenosis at the site of prior coronary stenting, called \"in-stent\" restenosis, is also a significant clinical problem. In collaboration with Johns Hopkins University, we have begun testing paclitaxel in a pig model of in-stent restenosis in which two stents are deployed in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery at the same location one month apart. The first stent, a 3 mm x 9 mm un-coated NIR stent, was deployed in the LAD to produce arterial injury and induce neointima formation. The second stent, a 3 mm x 16 mm paclitaxel-coated (60 ug stent) or uncoated NIR stent, was deployed inside of the original stent 30 days later. One month after the second stent, the pigs were sacrificed and the presence of neointimal hyperplasia at the injury site analyzed using angiographic and histological methods. Preliminary results show that neointima formation one month after placement of the second stent was similar in the paclitaxel-treated and control groups. In contrast, the arterial lumen in the drug-treated animals was almost 40% larger than in the untreated controls, consistent with presence of positive arterial remodeling. These effects were confirmed in the post-mortem angiographic results, which showed a larger dye-filled arterial lumen in the pigs receiving a second stent coated with paclitaxel (vs the uncoated stent group). These results suggest that local delivery of paclitaxel is therapeutically effective in relieving coronary obstruction resulting from in-stent restenosis. Based on our studies, leading to years of preclinical and clinical development in multiple academic centers workdwide, a paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system has been implemented by Boston Scientific and granted FDA approval (March 2004) for clinical use in the United States. It is estimated that the paclitaxel stent share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market is in excess of 65-70%.',\n",
       " 'Gene therapy may represent a novel approach for the treatment of myocardial ischemia. This research project aims at developing adenoviral vectors to transfer the cDNA for endothelial cell growth factors into cardiac cells. The same adenoviral vectors will be used for two different studies: (1) Angiogenesis and improvement of coronary collateral circulation: Neovascularization is expected to improve blood flow to ischemic areas of the myocardium. For this study the adenoviral vectors will be injected into the coronary circulation or directly into the myocardium. (2) Restenosis after angioplasty: Rapid reendothelialization of a segment of coronary artery which has undergone endothelial denudation during angioplasty may be expected to decrease the severity of restenosis and intimal hyperplasia. For this study the adenoviral vectors will be delivered to the localized area of the coronary artery which has undergone balloon dilatation. We have constructed adenoviral vectors which carry the cDNA for the following angiogenic growth factors. (1) Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). (2) Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF). (3) A recombinant form of aFGF which has been modified with the addition of the secretory signal sequence from FGF-4 (sp-aFGF). Unlike the natural form of aFGF this recombinant form of aFGF is secreted into the extracellular space. Our initial studies show all three adenoviral vectors produce a functional protein capable of inducing endothelial cell growth and differentiation in vitro. In additional studies with an adenoviral vector which carries the cDNA for the reporter gene lacZ (AdRSV.lacZ) we have examined whether adenoviral vectors can transduce cardiac cells in the minipigs. We have found that intracoronary injection of Ad RSV.lacZ transduces endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and myocardial cells. In contrast, intramyocardial injection of AdRSV.lacZ transduces mostly myocardial cells. Studies are now in progress to further characterize the properties of the vectors which carry the cDNA for the angiogenic factors prior to their use in in vivo models of myocardial ischemia and restenosis after angioplasty.

       " 'SUMMARY OF WORK The migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a key event in the pathogenesis of many vascular diseases. We previously showed that the regulation of PDGF-directed VSMC migration by growth status and basic FGF (FGF-2) is specifically mediated through their effects on the activation of calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII). Our current work is focussed on identifying the intracellular targets for CamKII, its upstream regulation, and its unique role in beta3 integrin-mediated signaling. We have shown that occupancy of beta3 integrin complexes is required for CamKII activation and VSMC migration and that signaling from beta3 integrins to CamKII occurs through a FGF2-dependent signaling pathway. suggesting that occupancy of beta3-containing integrins in VSMCs not only regulates migration by facilitating CamKII activation. In addition, we have shown that antibodies against thrombospondin (TSP) and integrin-associated protein (IAP), which is the major cellular binding site for the C-terminal binding domain (CBD) of TSP, also block migration though the beta3 integrin- and CamKII- dependent pathways. Interestingly, the migration of VSMC cell lines isolated from old animals is not affected by beta3 integrin blockade. These older cells apparently utilize non-integrin signaling pathways for migration and may be deficient in \"functional\" beta3 integrins or TSP production. These results represent the first demonstration of how outside-in signaling by beta3-containing integrins modulates a specific growth-factor stimulated signaling pathway. They identify a unique intracellular signalling network in VSMCs that is triggered by chemoattractant recognition and modulated by growth status, secretion of growth factors and ECM components, and ECM-VSMC interactions. They also identify an important difference between VSMCs isolated from animals of different ages that could account for the greater responsiveness of older vessels to injury. ',\n",
       " 'SUMMARY OF WORK Advanced glycation endproducts of proteins (AGE) accumulate in the plasma and in tissues with advancing age and at an accelerated rate in diabetes. In isolated vascular cells, AGEs induce a pro-oxidant stress, leading to activation of pro-inflammatory events such as increased activity of MAPK and NF-kB, increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(MCP-1) poduction, and increased PDGF B chain activity, all of which have been implicated in vascular lesion development. Our research efforts are focussed on identifying the signaling pathways by which AGEs affect gene expression so that molecular strategies can be developed to block their effects. Our results indicate that signaling is initiated by the binding of AGEs to a unique receptor called RAGE. We have cloned RAGE from rat intimal vascular smooth muscle cells and constructed epitope-tagged wild type and mutant receptors and shown that transfection of wild type receptor leads to increased MAPK activity and MCP-1 RNA and protein levels in response to AGEs. Mutant receptor in which the cytosolic tail has been removed, however, do not result in increased MCP-1 production, but in fact block the ability of co-transfected wild type receptors to signal. These observations provide the first demonstration that RAGE may act directly to engage intracellular signaling events and suggest that truncated RAGE may act as a dominant negative receptor to block the signaling effects of AGEs. These observations will be exploited to determine the role of AGEs in in vivo models of vascular injury using transgenic and knockout technologies. In additon, interaction cloning techniques will be used to identify intracellular proteins associated with the receptor. ',\n",
       " 'Environmental stresses converge on the mitochondria that can trigger or inhibit cell death. Excitable, post-mitotic cells (such as cardiac myocytes in heart, and neurons in brain), in response to sub-lethal noxious stress engage mechanisms affording protection from subsequent insults. These protection mechanisms involve activation of endogenous signaling which can confer significant resistance to oxidant and other stresses associated with hypoxia reoxygenation (i.e., during a heart attack or stroke), which promotes the enhanced capacity for cell survival. However, the upstream signaling mechanisms have remained an area of active debate, and the end effector(s) have remained unsolved. We show that reoxygenation after prolonged hypoxia reduces the reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) threshold for the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) in cardiac myocytes, and that cell survival is steeply negatively correlated with the fraction of depolarized mitochondria. We demonstrate that a wide variety of cardio neuroprotective agents acting via distinct upstream mechanisms all promote cell survival by limiting MPT induction. We found that protection can be triggered in 2 general ways dependent and independent of regulatory mitochondrial swelling which converge via inhibition of GSK-3beta on the end effector, the permeability transition pore complex, preventing the MPT. Cell protection exhibiting a memory (preconditioning) results from triggered mitochondrial swelling causing enhanced substrate oxidation and ROS production, leading to redox activation of PKC which inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Alternatively, receptor tyrosine kinase or certain G-protein coupled receptor activation elicits cell protection (without mitochondrial swelling or durable memory) by inhibiting GSK-3beta, via either PKB Akt and mTOR p70s6k, PKC, or PKA pathways. The convergence of these pathways via inhibition of GSK-3beta on the end effector, the permeability transition pore complex, to limit MPT induction, is the general mechanism of cardiomyocyte protection. We propose that clinical treatment strategies designed to inhibit the \"master switch\" kinase, GSK-3beta, to protect the permeability transition pore complex from MPT induction, would be effective to reduce the size of infarction during episodes of heart attack or stroke by preventing the death of cardiac myocytes and neurons (respectively).',\n",
       " 'A. To determine whether chronic endurance training is protective against silent myocardial ischemia (SI), we determined the prevalence of exercise-induced SI ST segment depression on exercise ECG and segmental perfusion defects on tomographic (SPECT) thallium scan) in 70 male master athletes aged 63 plus minus 6 yrs and 85 healthy, age-matched untrained men.The prevalence of SI was similar in athletes and untrained men (16% vs 21%, p=0.36). Of note, the apolipoprotein E4 phenotype was present in 9 of the 11 athletes with SI compared to only 2 of 32 athletes with normal exercise results (p less than or equal to 0.001). B. Whether exercise tomographic (TOMO) thallium (TI) imaging improves the detection of future coronary events (CE) compared with planar Tl imaging in apparently healthy volunteers is not known.Accordingly, the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of Tl was assessed in 329 BLSA volunteers 40-87 years old and compared with planar Tl results in another 407 similar BLSA subjects.The prevalence of silent ischemia (SI), defined by concordant ST segment changes and a planar or TOMO Tl defect, increased approximately 7-fold from the fifth to the eighth decades. Although the sensitivity and specificity of planar Tl (28% and 97% respectively) were nearly identical to those for TOMO Tl (28% and 89%, respectively), for identifying future CE, the positive predictive value for planar Tl (48%) was significantly higher than that for TOMO Tl (17%).C.To determine whether ischemic ST segment changes occurring only during recovery from maximal treadmill exercise predict future coronary events (CE) in clinically healthy populations, we compared 2 groups of BLSA subjects: 150 with 1mm ST segment depression occurring during exercise (Group 1) and 64 with such ST changes limited only to recovery (Group 2). The 2 groups were similar in age, gender, and coronary risk factors.Over a mean follow-up of 7.3 years, CE (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction or coronary death) developed in 14.6% of Group 1 and 18.7% of Group 2, p=NS.By logistic regression analyses older age (p=.0007), higher serum cholesterol (p=.002) and shorter exercise duration (p=.002) but not the time of ST depression onset(exercise vs recovery) were independent predictors of future CE.

       " 'Ca++-induced Ca++ release (CICR) from intracellular stores is a ubiquitous Ca++ signalling process that amplifies a Ca++ stimulus via positive feedback. The nature of the signal that terminates the release of Ca++ from the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum has remained elusive. This study was intended to examine whether the immunophilin FK506-binding protein (FKBP), a 12.6 KDa peptide that is tightly associated to ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca++ release channel, plays a role in the termination of CICR in heart. Confocal microscopy and the Ca++ indicator fluo-3 were used to visualize the in situ gating of RyRs as \"Ca++ sparks\". We observed that inhibition of FKBP by FK506 or rapamycin turned brief Ca++ sparks into long-lasting \"Ca++ glows\" in rat ventricular myocytes, increasing the mean open time of RyRs from 14.6 to 93 ms. Ca++ sparks with two-level amplitudes, resembling RyRs full and sub-conductance openings, were also observed. In voltage-clamped cells, Ca++ sparks evoked by depolarization pulses had a 6.8-fold increase in duration in the presence of FK506. The frequency of Ca++ spark occurrence was unaffected by FK506. In addition, FK506 potentiated and prolonged the electrically stimulated [Ca++]i transient and contraction, and subsequently induced spontaneous oscillations of [Ca++]i that are potentially arrythmogenic. These observations in situ were extended by single-channel recordings or rat cardiac RyRs incorporated in planar lipid bilayers. FK506 prolonged the lifetime of RyR openings and induced the occurrence of sub-conductance states in bilayers at both 0.1 and 10 muMM [Ca++]. Furthermore, in bilayers, FK506 virtually abolished RyR ~adaptation~, the spontaneous decay of RyR activity elicited by step increases of [Ca++] (from 0.1 to 10 muM) produced by photolysis of Ca++-caged compound NP-EGTA. Altogether, we conclude that FKBP, by facilitating the closure of RyR and enabling RyR to adapt to sustained Ca++ stimuli, may afford an intrinsic mechanism to terminate RyR openings and thus to exert a negative feedback regulation of CICR in heart cells.

       " 'Cardiac cell loss marks the transition from hypertrophy to heart failure and is the likely result of chronic myocardial ischemia and cell hypoxia. Cell loss is due predominantly to the death of cardiac myocytes and is mediated in part by apoptosis. Because adult cardiac myocytes are terminally differentiated cells, the effects of such loss can never be full compensated. The identification of the intracellular signaling events and extracellular factors that regulate this process and the development of strategies to prevent such loss is, therefore, likely to have important beneficial consequences. We have adopted an experimental system to induce cardiomyocyte cell death by apoptosis that involves exposing neonatal cardiomyocytes to prolonged hypoxia. We show that in these cells there is increased expression and transactivating ability by the tumor suppressor gene, p53, that accompanies the onset of apoptotic cell death. In addition, expression of p21 WAF1, a downstream target of p53, also increases during hypoxia. Forced expression of either p53 or p21 WAF1 in normoxic myocytes through infection with recombinant adenoviruses leads to apoptosis, as does the incubation of normoxic myocytes with bafilomycin, an inhibitor of membrane-associated proton pumps which, in other cell types, leads to intracellular acidification. Apoptosis induced by all these different mechanisms (hypoxia, infection with recombinant adenoviruses expressing p53 and p21, and bafilomycin) is effectively prevented by exposure to the hypertrophy-inducing factor, phenylephrine. The demonstration that p53 is involved in the apoptosis of cardiac myocytes was unexpected since these cells are terminally growth arrested. Because the p53 pathway for apoptosis is often associated with cellular stress and p53 knockout mice show no overt cardiac defects, a strategy to prevent apoptosis that involves inactivating p53 is unlikely to interfere with the normal tissue remodelling necessary for heart formation.

       " 'SUMMARY OF WORK Excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) in skeletal muscle is mediated in part by a direct, allosteric interaction between dihydropyridine (DHPR) voltage sensors in the t-tubule membrane and ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2+ release channels on the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This interaction cannot account for the kinetics of SR Ca2+ release during voltage clamp depolarizations, which consists of a transient release phase followed by a plateau of sustained release. It has been hypothesized that Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) amplifies the voltage-controlled release, giving rise to the transient phase; this would be compatible with the ultrastructural evidence that only 1 2 of the RyR\\'s are directly coupled to DHPR\\'s. CICR is an intrinsically self-reinforcing phenomenon, which is paradoxical since SR Ca2+ release remains under continuous, graded control by t-tubule voltage at all times. Because RyR are grouped in dense linear arrays along the t-tubule, CICR channels can be activated by Ca2+ released from neighboring CICR channels as well as that from voltage-controlled channels. The interaction between the stochastic gating of channels in the array and the local diffusion of Ca2+ must give rise to a complex process whose consequences cannot be appreciated by unaided intuition. To help understand this process, we developed a mathematical technique to simulate numerically the stochastic dynamics of diffusion-coupled arrays of RyR\\'s. The simulation revealed that the stochastic interaction of CICR channels allows CICR to be smoothly graded and temporally regulated by the voltage-dependent release, even though the CICR mediated release may be much larger in magnitude. The model reproduced numerous experimentally observed properties of SR Ca2+ release, including the transient sustained kinetics, the voltage dependence of the release components, the effects of Ca2+ buffers and, most surprisingly, the paradoxical phenomenon of \"quantal release,\" in which a prior conditioning depolarization can suppress release by a subsequent test pulse of lower voltage, but not one of higher voltage. Examination of the detailed workings of the model show that its success depends on collective interactions of mesoscopic (10-60 channel) arrays of release channels, rather than single-channel properties. These arrays, which we term couplons are the functional units of ECC. ',\n",
       " 'SUMMARY OF WORK This research area involves the study of embryonic stem cells prior to and during differentiation to cardiomyocytes. For these studies, we employ embryonic stem (ES) cells (R1, D3), embryonic germ cells (EG-1) and embryonic carcinoma cells (P19). We have established one of the most efficient systems available for the generation of cardiomyocytes from ES cells in vitro, and we have established when the ryanodine receptor, SR CaATPase, phospholamban and dihydropyridine receptor were first expressed with in vitro differentiation, permitting studies of EC coupling with differentiation. Selection protocols (most recently with a cardiac-restricted portion of the Na Ca exchanger promoter) have permitted the isolation of cardiomyocytes. Overall, the research is aimed at generating cardiac-lineage specific cells to understand the role of regulatory proteins in the formation of cardiomyocytes in vitro. Additionally, if the cells can be isolated to homogeneity and shown to be viable after in vitro differentation, then we propose using this technique to test delivery protocols and improvements of cardiac function following cellular based therapies in rodent. A major focus of this basic research effort is devoted to the improved viability of these cells during in vitro cultivation conditions. Several target genes are also being modified in the stem cells to determine their role in cardiomyocyte differentiation and survival, and more recently, we have begun isolating (and targeting) cells to select sub-populations of cardiac progenitor cells that may be more appropriate for cellular based therapies. By studying the basic biology of embryonic stem cells, we hope to delineate mechanisms responsible for cardiomyocyte development and renewal, and apply these results to improve cellular based therapies that may be applicable to man.',\n",
       " 'Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulem in cardiac cells during excitation-contraction coupling is inatiated by Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels. We recently demonstrated the feasibility to visualize Ca2+ influxes of single L-type Ca2+ channel (LCC) openings- \"Ca2+ sparklets\"- using confocal linescan imaging combined with patch clamp techniques. Here we directly visualize the process that Ca2+ sparklets trigger Ca2+ sparks in rat ventricular myocytes. To preserve the delicate molecular architecture of E-C coupling, loose-patch clamp is established by gently pressing the patch pipette against cell surface without suction. In the presence of 10 microM FPL64176 and 20 mM [Ca2+]o, depolarization pulses (-40 to +50 mV) evoke local Ca2+ transients that fall into two distinct categories. The low-amplitude events with irregular duration were resistant to ryanodine (10 mM), but were abolished by 2 mM nifedipine, and thus represent Ca2+ sparklets. The high-amplitude events were identified as Ca2+ sparks by virtue of morphology and sensitivity to ryanodine. The blockade of Ca2+ sparklets by substitution of Ca2+ with Ba2+ in the pipette abolished the Ca2+ spark activity, indicating that the sparks are triggered by sparklets. Our data provide direct evidence that Ca2+ flux from single L-type channel is capable of triggering a Ca2+ spark. The simultaneous recording of sparklets and sparks make it possible to probe into kinetics of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling at the single-channel level. During 400-ms depolarising pulses, 71% of the first local Ca2+ events occurred as triggered sparks, suggesting that a Ca2+ sparklet does not always elicit a spark. When a sparklet did trigger a spark, the latency varied widely from case to case. Interestingly, the coupling fidelity was significantly reduced to 30% after the first triggered spark, reflecting a local refractoriness of SR Ca2+ release. These evidence suggest that the LCC-RyR coupling is probabilistic rather than deterministic by nature, and that the coupling efficiency varies in a use-dependent manner. Ca2+ sparklets of known iCa also offer a natural standard to gauge the SR Ca2+ efflux underlying the spark (jspark). Upon repolerization to -70 mV, tail current-evoked sparklets displayed a rising time constant of 9.3 ms and a steady-state amplitude of 57 nM. By comparison, an averaged Ca2+ spark exhibited a peak amplitude that was 3.1-fold greater than the sparklet at the same rising time. Assuming a linear relation between Ca2+ flux and local Ca2+ transient, we estimated that the average jspark mounts to 2.1 pA, suggesting that 4 ~ 6 RyRs are tipically involved in an evoked Ca2+ spark. Altogether, our work provide direct evidence that Ca2+ sparklets due to single LCCs constitute fundamental trigger events of SR Ca2+ release, which ignite elemental Ca2+ sparks originated from 4 ~ 6 RyRs. We found that cardiac E-C coupling at the molecular level is inherently stochastic. The optical analysis of single-channel physiology and intermolecular crosstalk affords a powerful means for elucidation of Ca2+ signalling mechanisms at the molecular level.',\n",
       " 'The ryanodine receptor (RyR) is a prototypical ion channel that mediates Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic sarcoplasmic reticulum, and thereby plays important roles in intracellular Ca2+ signalling in eukaryotic cells. Instances of local Ca2+ release from clusters of RyRs, in the form of \"Ca2+ sparks\", constitute the elementary Ca2+ signalling events in many types of cells. Ironically, the nature of Ca2+ sparks remain elusive, as known properties of RyRs in vitro cannot fully account for the genesis of Ca2+ sparks. Using the \"Ca2+ sparklets\"ref produced by single L-type channel Ca2+ influx as the calibration standard, here we show that Ca2+ release current associated with a spark can be split into subtler quantal units, each from the all-or-none opening of a single RyR. The quantal analysis further demonstrated that interaction of RyRs in multi-quantum sparks confers an unusual, thermodynamically irreversible behavior to RyR gating in vivo. Furthermore, spark rise time is inversely related to the number of quanta involved, indicating the presence of a strong negative feedback component in the coupling of RyRs. These findings afford a novel view of nanoscopic interactions of Ca2+ release channels in intact cells.',\n",
       " ' of work: In obesity-related insulin resistance, chronic exposure to elevated concentrations of glucose can alter the thiol redox state of the cells by a mechanism that involves generation of reactive oxygen species. The insulin receptor contains reactive sulfhydryl group(s) in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor beta-subunit whose function remain unclear. Changes in reactivity of this receptor thiol group(s) has been evaluated with a thiol-biotinylating agent. Cells were incubated in the presence of 5.7 mM or 25 mM glucose for varying amounts of time. Also, the effect of hydrogen peroxide alone or together with vanadate was assessed. Immunoprecipitation of the insulin receptor followed by immunoblotting with streptavidin-bound agarose has indicated a time-dependent reduction in receptor thiol reactivity by high glucose. Vanadate alone did not alter the reactivity of IR thiol(s) but greatly enhanced the oxidative effect of hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that there is a critical thiol group(s) in the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor that is susceptible to glucose and intracellular oxidants. This is the first evidence for alteration of receptor thiol reactivity under conditions that involve generation of low levels of reactive oxygen species, which suggests that this alteration might regulate the receptor function and or its mode of interaction with other cellular constituents. Specific inhibitors of several oxidant-generating enzymes, including cyclo-oxygenase, cytochrome P-450, nitric oxide synthase, NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and lipoxygenase are being used to assess the function of these enzymes in glucose-mediated reduction in receptor thiol reactivity and signal transduction. Progress is being made in the identification of the reactive receptor thiol group(s). ',\n",
       " 'IkappaB kinase (IKK) catalytic subunits play a key role in cytokine-mediated nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling, and a loss of NF-kB function appears to inhibit inflammation and oncogenesis. Manumycin A, a natural epoxyquinoid compound, is a potent and selective farnesyltransferase inhibitor with antitumor activity. Our recent findings indicate that treatment with manumycin A resulted in a rapid, selective and potent inhibition of TNF alpha-stimulated IKK activity in a number of cell lines and a primary culture of rat hepatocytes. Unexpectedly, other classes of farnesyltransferase inhibitors had no inhibitory effect. To identify the molecular mechanisms of manumycin A action, we transfected human HepG2 hepatoma cell line with IKKalpha and IKKbeta constructs and demonstrated direct inhibition of IKK activity with concomittant formation of stable homotypic IKKbeta dimers in the presence of manumycin A. A number of Cys-> Ala point mutants of IKKbeta were generated to investigate the possibility that IKKbeta covalent dimerization results from nucleophilic attack on the epoquinoid core of manumycin A. Cells expressing IKKbeta mutated in the activation loop at Cys-179 exhibited similar dimer formation, whereas double substitution of Cys-662 and 716 conferred protection against homotypic dimerization by manumycin A. Direct inhibition of IKK activity and formation of stable IKKbeta dimers were observed in the presence of manumycin A that could be blocked by dithiothreitol. IKK interaction with the adaptor protein IKKgamma NEMO was also disrupted in manumycin A-treated cells. Importantly, administration of manumycin A to mice xenografted with murine B16F10 tumors caused potent IKK-suppressive effects. The fact that dithiothreitol could neutralize manumycin A, led us to examine the formation of an adduct between manumycin A and two thiol molecules utilizing mass spectrometry. Thus, manumycin A plays important regulatory function in IKK signaling through pathways distinct from its role as farnesylation inhibitor. We are planning to use an in vivo approach to investigate the effects of manumycin A on the activation of IKKbeta, a major contributor to inflammation-induced insulin resistance. Various tissues will be collected (e.g., liver, muscle, pancreas and fat) and processed for Western blot, in vitro IKK activity and EMSA (NF-kappaB) studies. It is anticipated that our results will demonstrate that IKKbeta is a direct target of manumycin A in vivo. Future plans include the study of the effect of manumycin A in the regulation of insulin responsiveness in physiological and pathophysiological pro-inflammatory states such as diet-induced obesity and aging.',\n",
       " 'Impaired platelet-derived nitric oxide (NO) contributes to acute coronary syndromes by enhancing platelet recruitment and thrombus formation. Polymorphic variants of the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) gene have been associated with cardiovascular diseases. To examine whether eNOS variants affect platelet-derived NO and platelet function, we studied platelets from 47 healthy caucasians who were genotyped for eNOS polymorphisms in the promoter region (T786--C), in intron 4, and in exon 7 (Glu298Asp). Platelet aggregation, platelet-derived NO and superoxide production were measured in control samples and samples pretreated with 17-alpha estradiol (10 nM). The occurrence of variants in the promoter region (p=.002) or in exon 7 (p=.007), but not intron 4 (p>.05), were associated with lower levels of platelet-derived NO. An increased (p=.047) release of superoxide was observed in platelets from subjects with the variant in the promoter region, but not with other eNOS genetic variants. The eNOS gene polymorphisms did not affect ADP-induced platelet aggregation (p>.05). However estradiol significantly increased platelet aggregation (p=.004), and platelet-derived superoxide (p=.047) in individuals homozygous for the variant in exon 7, but not in subjects with other genotypes. The data demonstrate that the eNOS variants in the promoter region and in exon 7 decrease platelet-derived NO and that estradiol significantly increases platelet aggregation in subjects homozygous for the variant in exon 7 but not in subjects with other genotypes, suggesting that eNOS variants may influence the thrombotic response.',\n",
       " 'Nutrition evaluation in the male and female participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) has been carried out by periodic collection of 7-day dietary diaries and by measurement of vitamin levels in plasma. The diary technique has provided data over a 35 year period in men and a 15 year period in women. The ages of the participants range from 20 to 95 years. Since the BLSA is a multi-disciplinary study, it is possible to carry out correlations between nutritional intakes and levels and other potentially related variables and outcomes. The results of longitudinal changes in diet (aging and secular effects) over three decades (1960s, 1970s, and 1980s) have been reported. We have re-initiated dietary diary collection for the 1990s by establishing collaborations with USDA and HNRCA scientists (see above). There are no data sets elsewhere on nutritional variables in human beings of comparable duration, reliability, number of subjects, and association with important physiologic and outcome variables. An analysis has been carried out of the intake of three of the B-vitamins (folacin, B12, and B6) in 564 participants over the adult age range. Intake via diet and via supplementary vitamins was quantified. An intake of 2 3 or less of the RDA for each vitamin could be taken as the \"at risk\" level. Since this population is generally highly educated, upper-middle socio-economic class, and, to some extent at least, health conscious it was surprising that a relatively high percentage fell into the at risk category, especially for B6 intake. In general, although age and sex differences were not large, the younger subjects 20-59 years had a higher percentage at risk than those aged 60-95 years and this was true in men and women. Interestingly, those taking supplemental B-vitamins tended to have higher intakes in their food than those who did not take supplements, i.e., generally those not requiring supplements are the ones who take the additional vitamins.

       " 'Oxidative stress and DNA damage play a critical role in the development of degenerative diseases, and may underlie the aging process itself. Cells respond to such stresses with the induction of numerous gene products but little is known concerning the signal transduction pathways mediating these effects or the functional significance of the induced gene products. Recent evidence indicates that the signaling pathways mediating the cellular stress response overlap significantly with those regulating the response to mitogenic stimuli and involve one or more mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades. This project focuses on several topics aimed at increasing our understanding of basic mechanisms associated with the activation of gene expression to different forms of genotoxic stress and the consequences of the response. These include: (1) differential activation of various MAP kinases (ERK, JNK SAPK and p38) in response to diverse genotoxic and growth arrest-inducing stresses including UVC irradiation, hydrogen peroxide, methyl methanesulfonate, sodium arsenite, prostaglandin A2 and phenylacetate; (2) the role of growth factor receptors and oxidant injury in sensing damage and triggering MAP kinase activation in response to different stresses; (3) mechanisms involved in attenuating the response; and (4) the relationships between these acute cellular responses and survival. In addition, we are investigating the response to genotoxic stress as a function of aging using primary hepatocytes derived from young and aged animals as a model. We have provided evidence that ERK MAP kinase activation in response to both mitogenic stimulation and genotoxic stress declines with aging and are exploring the mechanisms contributing to this decline.

       " 'Beta cells of the pancreas, which make and secrete insulin, do not respond like those of non-diabetic subjects when type 2 diabetes is present. Specifically, subjects suffering from type 2 diabetes have a blunted or even absolute loss of first phase and a severely blunted second phase insulin release in response to glucose. In conjunction with this, and despite all treatments currently available to treat diabetes, beta cell function continues to deteriorate over time. With the data now available from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (Sept. 1998) this point was brought home even more forcefully. Despite continual monitoring of patients enrolled in the study, euglycemia could not be maintained even with intensive therapy, because of declining beta cell function. We have been working for some time with GLP-1, a naturally occurring peptide produced and released from the gut in response to food. The amount released depends on the amount of glucose and fat that has been ingested. After its plasma levels increase, GLP-1 binds to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) on beta cells, and increases PKA activity because of cAMP generation. Downstream of the increased PKA activity, insulin release occurs also in a glucose-dependent manner, plasma glucose having risen because of the meal. The end result is a restoration of plasma glucose back to baseline. Consequently, GLP-1 analogs and GLP-1R agonists are under intense study as treatments for type 2 diabetes. A naturally occurring GLP-1R agonist, exendin-4, is now available for treatment. It binds to GLP-1R with ten times more avidity than does native GLP-1. It contains many amino acids homologous to GLP-1 and, interestingly, contains a unique 9 amino acid C-terminus. We have extensively investigated the functional significance of the C-terminus by studying the effects on GLP-1 when it is added to the C-terminus of GLP-1 and by deleting the 9 amino acids sequentially and in triads from exendin-4. Its addition to GLP-1 improved its binding affinity to its own receptor and its deletion from exendin-4 abrogated its increased affinity for GLP-1R. Another insulinotropic peptide, GIP, is also released from the gut after eating, but, based on BLSA data, beta cells of the pancreas appear resistant to its effects once blood glucose exceed 126 mg dl. Additionally, in vivo experimental protocols in humans using exogenous GIP have shown that beta cells do not increase insulin secretion in response to exogenous human GIP. GIP is also subject to rapid breakdown by dipeptidyl peptidase 1V. Therefore, we are currently testing in type 2 diabetic humans if a dipeptidyl peptidase 1V-resistant GIP peptide might be successful at increasing insulin secretion from beta cells. This study involves 24 subjects to which increasing concentrations of the peptide have been given up to a maximum of 20 ng kg min. This protocol is now finished and the data is being analyzed.',\n",
       " 'Recently, in conjunction with collaborators at Johns Hopkins, we have been studying the effects of hypogonadism on insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Patients with prostate cancer who undergo androgen deprivation therapy as part of their treatment become not only insulin resistant but more than 50% also develop the metabolic syndrome. This clearly puts them at risk for strokes and heart attacks and therefore the treatment for the prostate cancer will increase their mortality and morbidity. This is a new and evolving field of interest and data is just now appearing from other groups confirming our findings. We are currently divising a protocol to carry out a prospective study of prostate cancer patients (some of whom will have cancer-removal surgery of the prostate, some of who will receive androgen deprivation therapy and some of whom will receive both) and follow them longitudinally. We wish to determine, 1) when and why insulin resistance manifests itself and in which group, 2) introduce therapy in a subpopulation to lessen insulin resistance ( metformin, pioglitazone, exendin-4, or GLP-1) and follow outcomes, 3) quantify the degree of insulin resistance using glucose clamps, and, 4) attempt to define the mechanism of action by which androgen deprivation leads to insulin resistance. If androgen therapy continues to be a treatment for prostate cancer, proper management strategies of androgen deprived patients will be required.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic progressive illness for which early diagnostic options and effective therapy are needed. We hypothesize that periarticular factors such as body fatness and muscle function are important indicators of knee OA, and also hypothesize changes in serum proteins that accompany knee and hand osteoarthritis (OA) can be detected years before the OA becomes radiographically evident. EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES OF OSTEOARTHRITIS AND AGING We have integrated clinically relevant measures of joint, bone and muscle function to assess musculoskeletal aging into the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Integration of these state-of-the-art imaging and physiologic measures of muscle, bone, and joints we will be better able to delineate healthy aging, the transition into common age-associated diseases (i.e. osteoarthritis, osteoporosis), and study the complex interplay between the processes that profoundly influence mobility function in late life. We have also conducted a study to delineate the relationship between muscle, bone and fat and knee OA, and explore the possible role of various inflammatory, metabolic and hormonal factors as mediators of these relationship using stored serum specimens obtained from BLSA participants up to 10 years prior to their developing radiographic knee OA. Blood samples have been tested using microarray platforms to detect proteins relevant to regulation of inflammation, cell growth and activation and metabolism along with serum and urine assays of cartilage and bone metabolism. We identified 16 proteins associated with OA, and 10 proteins that were differentially expressed years prior to OA classification. Results will be reported at the 2005 Scientific Meetings of the American College of Rheumatology. We have also conducted secondary analysis of BLSA data to test the hypothesis that individuals with hand OA have a higher likelihood of increased arterial stiffness compared to individuals without OA, even after adjusting for age. We examined pulse wave velocity and pulse pressure as surrogates of arterial stiffness in a subset of BLSA participants free of known cardiovascular disease and medications. Although significant individual relationships between arterial stiffness and various measures of hand OA were observed, this relationship appears attributable to the confounding effects of age. Results will be reported at the 2005 Scientific Meetings of the American College of Rheumatology. CLINICAL STUDIES OF KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS Participants are being recruited for a clinical study to determine whether muscle strength, mass and function important determinants of mobility function in adults with knee OA, and explore the extent to which these characteristics are associated with local inflammatory factors and circulating biomarkers. Adults 50 years and older with and without OA of the knee of comparable age, body weight and physical activity level are being sought. Although preliminary, we are observing interesting trends in motor-unit physiology that may be associated with early OA of the knee. In collaboration with members of the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center, we conducted a study to determine whether the inflammatory markers associated with knee OA change as weight reduction achieved by lifestyle physical activity modification and tailored exercise program. Lifestyle modification results in accumulated physical activity and exertion throughout the day and over the course of weeks. Tailored exercise incorporates exercises that are feasible for each individual. We will examine relationships between cartilage and bone biomarkers, knee pain and change in weight. Data analysis is underway. RESEARCH USING ANIMAL MODELS OF ARTHRITIS AND PHYSICAL INACTIVITY In close collaboration with the NMR unit of the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation, we previously conducted experiments to 1) delineate the functional and morphologic characteristics of skeletal muscle that are associated with arthritis, 2) determine whether arthritis-associated skeletal muscle properties is distinct from that induced by physical inactivity, and 3) explore the associations between muscle function, local and circulating inflammatory mediators. As we previously reported, collagen-induced arthritis and atrophy induced by hind-limb unloading both altered quadriceps muscle bioenergetics and contractile force, and also exerted measurable effects on bone quality that are assessed by micro-CT. Although these findings were accompanied by changes in skeletal muscle cytokine concentration, they correlated poorly with concentrations of circulating inflammatory mediators. In a subsequent study of similar design, we studied the effects of systemic erythropoietin on skeletal muscle bioenergetics and bone quality. A in-vitro bioreactor system has been developed that will allow us map the effects of other agents on skeletal muscle bioenergetics, thereby screening them for potential therapeutic value prior to animal testing. SUMMARY: A coordinated approach has been developed that spans epidemiologic, clinical and basic science that will explore mechanisms of osteoarthritis development and skeletal muscle malfunction in the context of aging and arthritis, and constitute a foundation upon which new therapeutic interventions strategies can be developed.',\n",
       " \"The concept of tumor suppressor gene dysregulation is a central theme in cancer biology. A powerful method for identifying potential tumor suppressor genes is loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis. Several recent studies have demonstrated an area of LOH on chromosome 6 band q22 in T-cell leukemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas refractory to chemotherapy, breast cancer and melanoma suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene at this locus. Using a c-myb specific probe, we have previously cloned a rearrangement from this region, designated myb recombination region (MRR). In recent work, we have demonstrated that MRR1 is the human homolog of the recently described Ahi-1 (Abelson helper integration) gene altered by viral insertion in a variety of murine T and B cell neoplasms. Based on a prototype human cDNA clone, the human MRR1 Ahi-1 gene encodes a novel nuclear WD-protein with an associated SH3 domain. Genomic analysis reveals MRR1 Ahi-1 to be a 250 kB gene containing 28 primary exons in addition to multiple alternative exons and at least two polyadenylation sites. Analysis of MRR1 Ahi-1 expression by RT-PCR revealed evidence of multiple alternatively spliced transcript forms in normal human tissues and cell lines. In normal human tissues, maximum expression is seen in brain, testis and ovary with variable expression in other tissues. Expression in human tumor cell lines reveals variable exprssion across given tumor types along with expression of T-cell tumor specific splice forms. Southern blotting experiments using a panel of exon-specific probes demonstrates a minimal frequency of gross structural alterations of MRR1 Ahi-1 in a variety of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. Additional alterations have been identified including a frame shift mutation in a cDNA from a uterine sarcoma and an aberrant mRNA species in a non-small cell lung cancer harboring a t1:6 translocation. Further analysis of ests from a variety of CGAP tumors reveals truncations and other message alterations in acute myeloid leukemia, prostate cancer and other tumor types. These results together indicate that an important and novel tumor suppressor gene has been isolated that resides in a region of chromosome 6q that is the site of frequent alteration in a wide range of tumor types. This is further confirmed by the recent finding of tumor cell growth suppression by consititutive expression of prototype MRR1 Ahi-1 and a number of domain specific deletion constructs. Work has also begun on the expression of the MRR1 Ahi-1 proteins. Work to date demonstrates both nuclear and cytoplasic anti-peptide antibody specific forms of MRR1 Ahi-1 proteins are expressed with a spectrum of molecular weights consistent with the finding of multiple mRNA forms produced based on RT-PCR data. The prototype form of the protein appears to be expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm though translocation to the nucleus occurs on induction of apoptosis by a variety of drugs. A form lacking the SH3 domain produced through use of an internal polyadenylation site within the gene appears to be expressed predominantly in the nucleus. In a range of human T-cell leukemia lymphoma and breast carcinoma cell lines, expression of one or more forms of MRR1 Ahi-1 protein appears to be lacking lending further credence to a possible role for this gene in these tumor types. Future work will continue to focus on the function of this gene product and its' alternatively spliced forms in control of normal and tumor cell proliferation differentiation and characterization of the proteins with which it interacts..\",\n",
       " 'This is a continuing normal volunteer donor protocol with Dr. Dan L. Longo as the current Principal Investigator. In this protocol, volunteers are recruited to undergo a two hour cytapheresis procedure for collection of large quantities of human circulating white blood cell components (lymphocytes or monocytes) from single donors for the use of National Institute on Aging laboratory investigators. Pheresis packs are supplied to individual qualified investigators as anonymous packs for use in basic studies of lymphocyte and monocyte function and studies of immune function in the aging process. Based on extensive modified American Bloodbank Association questionaires, laboratory screening including assessment of complete blood counts, urinalysis, liver and renal function as well as virologic screening including HIV and Hepatitis testing, the possibility of influence of extraneous infections or other chronic medical conditions on laboratory studies is minimized. In the course of the last year, the established donor pool has been expanded to 92 at present with a total of over 300 cytapheresis procedures representing a 40% increase in utilization were performed with cell packs supplied to individual investigators. Based on trends over the last several years, there is an increasing need for cells by a range of laboratories with expectation for continued expansion of participants as well as procedures in this protocol in the next year.',\n",
       " ' of Work: The purpose of this agreement was to support the collection and analysis of data on cause of death and characteristics of the last year of life in the planning of the 1992 Pretest and 1993 Main Survey of the 1993 National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS), conducted by NCHS, CDC. This survey will supplement information from death certificates in the vital statistics file with information on characteristics of the decedent. The pretest examined approximately 800 deaths of individuals aged 15 years and over who died in 1992. The main survey examined approximately 22,951 deaths of individuals aged 15 years and over who died in 1993. This includes 884 deaths to centenarians. Collection of field interview data has been completed, and a preliminary death certificate informant (DC I) file has been delivered to the NIA EDB by the NCHS in July of 1997. This file contains information keyed from the death certificate file and the informant interviews. Data from the final 1993 mortality file has been merged with the DC I file and stripped of personal identifiers to form a working file. Post-stratification adjustment factors and non-response adjustments have been developed to form the final sample weights for each file record. EDB staff have begun analyses on the preliminary file to check for undetected errors and to make recommendations to NCHS for production of the final analysis file, which is anticipated to be available in January 1998. At that point final analyses of the data file will begin. NCHS has concluded agreements with the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to link the NMFS data with administrative records from those two agencies. The linking with both SSA and HCFA is well under way. The SSA has been able to verify ( or correct) the social security number for about 98 percent of the decedents. Additional information from the death certificate and the informant questionnaire is in the process of being collected to help identify the outstanding two percent of decedents with a missing or inappropriate social security number. Once appropriate social security numbers have been established on the DC I file, a subset will be generated to independently link with SSA and HCFA data. The subset will consist of all DC I records for which the informant has given permission for a link to be made. Analytic plans will look at trends in reported lifetime history of conditions between the 1986 and 1993 NMFS, examination of lifestyle factors related to death at very old ages, hypotheses regarding decreased use of health services in the last years of life among the very old, and use of linked data from HCFA to study compression of morbidity among the oldest old.

       " \" of Work: The objective of this project is to develop a package of brief, safe and reliable measures of exercise tolerance that, in total, is broadly applicable and highly discriminating in population studies of older persons. The first phase of testing and evaluation has been completed at the Baltimore Veteran's Administration Medical Center through an interagency agreement (Y01-AG-4-0260). The following tests were administered on two occasions 7 to 10 days apart to a volunteer sample of 50 men and women age 54-80 years, 24 of whom had peripheral arterial disease: (1) timed usual and fast pace 4-meter walks; (2) timed usual and fast pace 20-meter walks; (3) 6-minute usual pace corridor walk; (4) seated step-test; and (5) treadmill walk. Heart rate at work, recovery heart rate, and blood pressure were measured. Two questionnaires were also piloted; one is a refinement of Taylor's Leisure Time Physical Activity questionnaire and the other measures physical function including ease of performance and level of fatigue as well as difficulty in performing higher order functional tasks. Preliminary results on test-retest reliability and associations among the walking and seated step tests were presented at GSA, November 1995. Analyses of the reliability and validity of questionnaires and final analyses of the exercise tolerance measures are proceeding. The original scope of work was completed in March 1996, approximately $15,000 under budget. A second phase of testing commenced October 1996, to evaluate a modification of the 6-minure walk, the HEALTH ABC Long Distance Corridor Walk (LDCW), designed to extend the testing range and improve the reproducibility of self-paced walking tests. Key features of the LDCW are the 2-minute warm-up walk that also serves as a stepped-down test and the focus on distance (400m) instead of time (e.g., 6 minutes). Performance on the LDCW and 6-minute walk were compared. Twenty men and women age 70 to 79 did both tests with a 15-minute rest between, during which they were administered a revised version of the physical activity questionnaire used in phase one. Test order alternated between subjects. Walking speed was consistently greater for the 400m walk than the 6-minute walk for all subjects and ending heart rate for the 400m walk was equal to or greater than ending heart rate for the 6-minute walk. Findings suggest that a target distance encouraged greater effort independent of fitness or test order. The LDCW protocol is being used in HEALTH ABC. A poster presentation of the protocol and evalution findings has been accepted for presentation at the 50th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Gerontological Society of American to be held November 1997. \",\n",
       " \" of Work: The purpose of this intra-agency agreement (Y02-AG-5-0282) is to support the measurement of arterial pulse wave velocity (APWV) as a measure of arterial stiffness in the NHLBI Activity Counseling Trial (ACT). The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that increases in physical activity resulting from educational interventions will reduce arterial stiffness. The setting is appropriate for this hypothesis testing because of the prospective nature of the study and the range of interventions which will be adopted. The measurements will be taken at three points in time when other physiologic measures are taken. This will allow assessment of intra-individual variability as well as the possibility of examining change over time in these measures in relation to the level of compliance with the physical activity intervention. The study is taking place in three geographic locations to assure adequate sample size for subgroup analysis: Memphis, TN, Dallas, TX and Palo Alto, CA. Pulse wave velocity is being measured by two Doppler flow velocity probes simultaneously measuring the carotid and femoral arteries. A computer algorithm calculates average flow velocity tracings on a beat-to-beat basis. The time needed for the pressure wave to travel from the proximal to distal sampling site is calculated from the foot of the pressure wave. The baseline examinations have now been completed, with approximately 500 APW tracings available for analysis. Quality control reports from the Coordinating Center indicate that a very high proportion of the tracings are of acceptable quality and will be useful for analysis. Personnel from the Reading Center in Baltimore and the Coordinating Center at Bowman Gray conducted a validation study at the three sites in March of this year. Records produced by measurement teams at the sites were compared to measurements made on the same individuals by the team of investigators from the reading center. Results of the study suggest that the protocol is valid and reproducible and measurements taken by the local site teams are highly correlated with those made by the visiting teams, with only slightly higher variability among the local site teams' readings. Presently the clinics are approximately two-thirds of the way through the process of making 6-month follow-up APWV measurements, and the quality of the readings appears to remain at a high level. Plans are under way for analysis of the baseline data and preparation of manuscripts. The final measurement of APWV will be conducted at 24 months subsequent to baseline. \",\n",
       " ' of Work: The MacArthur Study of Successful Aging represents a unique opportunity to assess the relationship between Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cortisol and to examine whether the IL-6-health outcome risks would be modified by cortisol over a longer follow-up period. Follow up on the MacArthur cohort now extends through and of the original cohort, approximately one-quarter have now died. We will measure IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) on frozen plasma samples on approximately 925 members of the MacArthur Study. Of this group of 925, approximately one-quarter have died which should provide ample power for mortality analysis. With these data, we will investigate the cross-sectional relationship of urinary cortisol to IL-6 and CRP and extend our initial findings of risks associated with IL-6 and CRP, examining whether urinary cortisol modifies any observed association. We will also examine the relationship of IL-6 and CRP to other blood markers influenced by cytokines including albumin, serum iron and hemoglobin A1c. The potential also exists to examine weight change, cognitive decline, depression, risk of fractures and other outcomes in relation to inflammation. ',\n",
       " 'This project aims to: (1) determine the relationship between performance on a standardized max treadmill test and performance on the 400m component of the LDCW, including variation by fitness level; (2) obtain an estimate of VO2max from time to complete 400m, among other parameters (e.g., ending HR, weight, sex, age); (3) determine the need to increase test ceiling; (4) obtain additional data on the relationship between 20m walking speed, 2-min distance, and 400m time; and (5) evaluate the advantages of the LDCW over treadmill-based tests for measuring exercise tolerance in older adults. Subjects consist men and women, 60 years or older participating in the BLSA who performed a maximal treadmill-walk test. Subjects were administered the Health ABC LDCW as part of their regular visit for the BLSA, the day after treadmill testing. The primary outcomes will provide: (1) a validated alternative to max treadmill-based tests of exercise tolerance that is safe and acceptable for use in longitudinal population-based studies of older adults and (2) equations for estimating VO2max from time to walk 400m applicable to older adults. We anticipate that validation of a low cost and safe alternative to treadmill testing will promote more widespread inclusion of exercise tolerance testing in studies of older adults and thereby facilitate increased understanding of the disabling process. In addition, the LDCW has the potential for use in clinical settings as an indicator of preclinical functional decline and for screening to identify those most in need of early intervention. The protocol received IRB approval in April 1999 and testing was initiated in August 1999. Data collection was completed in July 2000 with 107 subjects with valid treadmill results enrolled.

       " \"Mobility, defined as the ability to move independently from one point to another, emerges from the interaction of the individual with the environment. Mobility disability results when the individual is unable to meet the demands of the environment and thus restricts his or her mobility to smaller and smaller geographic ranges (i.e. immediate neighborhood, then their home, then one room in their home). Previous research examining mobility disability in older adults has focused primarily on factors within the individual such as weakness, pain, loss of motion, and co-morbidities that result in mobility disability. Little research has been done to explore the role of external factors, such as environmental features, on the emergence of mobility disability in older adults. This study has developed a tool to quantify the influence of specific environmental factors on the capacity for independent community mobility in older adults. An assessment protocol has been developed that examines the activities of older persons in their communities and evaluates actual activities done in the community. This protocol is being used to (a) identify critical environmental factors which contribute to mobility disability in older adults (for example which factors restrict individuals to their homes), (b) describe effective and ineffective strategies used by older adults to meet the demands of their community environment, and (c) develop mobility nomograms that can be used by clinicians to assess individual's mobility disability. Recent papers from assessmets done in two cities, Seattle, WA and Waterloo, Ontario have described the assessments.\",\n",

The analyses are based on evidence suggesting that ApoE4 genotype is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease and longevity in general as well as more suggestive evidence that it may also be associated with more general risks for cognitive decline and functional disability. Data on ApoE genotype for the MacArthur Successful Aging cohort is being obtained through analyses of stored DNA samples. These samples were originally collected in 1988 at the beginning of the study. Previous analyses of collected blood and urine samples have included assays for cholesterol, DHEA-S, glycosylated hemoglobin, homocysteine and folic acid levels as well as urinary cortisol and catecholamines. Additional, existing information int he MacArthur database includes sociodemographic, health status, health behaviors, psychosocial characteristics and detailed assessments of both physical and cognitive functioning. Data are now available for an 8-year follow-up period (1988-1996), including detailed information on patterns of change in cognitive and physical functioning, prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease and overall mortality. Cohort diversity with respect to gender, ethnicity, educational attainment and behavioral characteristics such as individuals' health behaviors (e.g., exercise, smoking) also provides sufficient numbers of individuals for proposed analyses of possible ApoE interactions with these characteristics.\",\n",
       " \"A large part of the medial temporal lobe consists of the hippocampal formations. Neuropathologic and clinical studies place atrophy in the hippocampal formations central in the processes related to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuropathologic studies show that the hippocampal formations are among the first to be diseased by the two classic lesions in AD, neuritic plaques and tangles. The hippocampal formations are also involved in short and long term memory, disturbances in which are one of the sentinel cognitive signs of AD. Hippocampus formations have also been shown to be smaller in persons with AD compared to controls. This evidence has led to the proposal that hippocampal atrophy be used as an aid to the diagnosis of AD and a predictor of future AD. Because there is evidence from several different types of studies that the hippocampus plays a central role in the AD, examining risk factors for hippocampal atrophy may help to gain insight into the etiology of AD. As a putative intermediate step in the dementing process, research on risk factors for hippocampal atrophy may help to formulate possible interventions in the early stages of AD. To date studies of risk factors for hippocampal atrophy are limited to small studies of socio-economic correlates. In 2001 we collaborated with Dr. MMB Breteler to examine factors associated with hippocampal atrophy in the Rotterdam Scan Study. This project is now finished. However, we continue to make use of data from the Honolulu -Asia Aging Study to examine the association of mid-life risk factors with hippocampal volumes. As a part of the HAAS cohort, 575 men underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 1994-1996. All hippocampal volumes and intracranial volume were measured by one person. Manuscripts are currently in preparation. This year we have extended our ability to study risk factors by collaborating with the Laboratory for Neuroimaging, UCLA in a project to look at hippocampal shape and risk factors\",\n",

We are currently conducting association studies of polymorphisms for inflammation and vascular disease in relation to the risk for dementia.',\n",
       " 'There is ample neuropathololgic evidence to suggest that inflammation plays an important role in the progression, and possibly initiation of the disease processes that ultimately lead to Alzheimers disease (AD). However little is known about the inflammatory profile of cases compared to non-cases, and whether cases have a predisposition toward a more pro-inflammatory phenotype. The cases and controls are currently being recruited from the study population of the Gingko Baloba Trial to slow the progression towards dementia. The goal is 65 cases and 65 controls. Subject recruitment will finish October, 2007. Celluar markers of the adaptive immune response The primary function of Th1 T helper cells is to assist the generation of cell-mediated immunity. They secrete a set of cytokines that are generally considered proinflammatory, exemplified by Interferon-c (IFN-c) and IL-12. Th2 cells function to assist humoral immunity, i.e., the generation of immunoglobulin by B cells. Th2 cells secrete a set of cytokines considered at least in some contexts, as anti-inflammatory, such as IL-4 and IL-10. Many of these cytokines have been identified in the neuropathologic material harvested from the brains of AD cases (McGeer and McGeer, 2001). Epidemiologic studies also suggest raised levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines may increase the risk for AD (Schmidt et al., 2002). A recent study demonstrated a Th1-dominated immune response in cases of AD (Remarque et al., 2001). Further, the promising vaccines have been developed on the basis of a humoral immune response to amyloid-b, the putative toxic protein in AD (Schenk et al., 1999). Little is known about cellular phenotypes in AD. Dr. Russell Tracy (University of Vermont) and colleagues have developed a new technique to characterize Th1 and Th2 cells. Their studies suggest the Th1 Th2 ratio is a characteristic individual phenotype that has good reliability over time. Their studies have also demonstrated the feasibility in doing these measures in epidemiologic studies. We propose to conduct a pilot study to test this phenotype in cases of Alzheimers disease and controls recruited through the Geriatric Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at Wake Forest Medical School (WFMS). It is hypothesized that AD cases will have a pro-inflammatory phenotype compared to controls.',\n",
       " 'The overarching goals of this research are to evaluate follow-up status, 1 to 2 years after baseline, of a cohort of persons aged 75-85 at baseline who were found to have functional limitations (EPESE performance battery score of 4-9) but who were able to walk 400 meters in a test done in the Hebrew Home rehabilitation unit. Specific questions to be addressed include: 1.What is the incidence of inability to walk 400 meters in at-risk older persons who were found to be able to walk this far at baseline 2.What are the main chronic diseases, impairments, and demographic characteristics which predict incident mobility loss 3.What questions can be asked to impute who will be unable to walk 400 meters in an objective test of walking this distance in the clinic.

       " 'A joint study with Drs. Basil and Hana Golding (CBER, FDA) has continued to follow a lead toward developing a therapeutic vaccine for treating patients in advanced stages of HIV infection whose immune systems have already been compromised. Our approach is based on the use of heat-killed Brucella abortus organisms (BA) as an adjuvant and combined T cell-dependent and -independent (type I) carrier. Immune responses to covalent conjugates of BA and HIV-derived peptides and recombinant proteins have been studied in normal and T cell-depleted mice. This carrier characteristically gives strong Th1-type responses and cytokine profiles, with potentially functional humoral and cellular immune responses, even in mice without a functioning level of CD4+ T cells. We are also preparing and evaluating covalent conjugates of HIV peptides and the purified lipopolysaccharide from B. abortus. These conjugates are less Th1-directing, and we will be seeking ways of further strengthening this type of response and cellular immunity through the use of specially designed delivery vehicles.

       " 'Although few, if any, Ig molecules bearing light chains of the K2 isotype are produced by our laboratory rabbits, we demonstrated transcription of the K2 gene by S1 protection analyses and light-chain sized mRNA by northern analysis with a K2-specific synthetic oligonucleotide probe. Similarly, although mutant Basilea rabbits produce little or no Igs with light chains of the J1-b9 type, we have detected low levels of b9 RNA. We are investigating whether this is aberrantly spliced message since we have found that the K1-b9 gene in Basilea rabbits has a point mutation in the splice acceptor site of the J-C intron. With similar methods, we have not however, detected mRNA or genomic DNA sequences corresponding to the b5 allotype that has been observed serologically to be produced by b9 b9 cells cultured in vitro with b5 anti-b9 and LPS. Thus alternative explanations for serological observations of latent allotypes must be invoked. We have also shown that synthetic oligonucleotides from the first and third framework regions (FR1 and FR3) of variable regions of heavy chains specifically distinguish mRNAs produced by a1 and a2 rabbits. The prototype FR1 and FR3 sequences may not, however, completely correlate with serologically detectable VHa determinants. A strain of rabbits carrying the parental chromosome from which the Basilea mutant was derived has been developed and shown to have a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the K2 gene also found in Basilea rabbits. This allows linkage studies of the K1 phenotype, K2 RFLP and a newly discovered RFLP of the rabbit T cell receptor chain constant region gene. We have analyzed and predicted the locations of kappa light chain allotypic determinants. Predicted determinants were external, located in or near loops, and fell in two clusters of potentially interacting regions within which several overlapping sets of epitopes could occur. Interaction of anti-K1 antibodies with such epitopes on IgG anti-hapten antibodies abolished hapten-mediated dissociation of the antibody from haptgen-coupled cells. ',\n",
       " \"1. Selection of mutants lacking orotidine-monophosphate-pyrophosphorylase (ura5) and orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase (ura3) from the two varieties of Cryptococcus neoformans; 2. Physical mapping of C. neoformans genes; 3. Molecular identification of C neoformans var. gattii isolated from Eucalyptus camaldulensis in Australia and San Francisco; 4. Stress induced chromosomal rearrangement in Candida albicans. Spontaneous mutants requiring uracil were isolated from both varieties of C. neoformans by plating on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) medium. Of the 36 strains (18 each from the two varieties), 24 generated (12 each) resistant cells requiring uracil for growth. The uracil requiring mutants of C neoformans var. gattii were identified either as ura3 or ura5 in equal frequency. The ura3 isolates were identified by enzyme assay while ura5 was identified by genetic complementation with a URA5 gene cloned from C. neoformans var. neoformans. The uracil requiring mutants of var. neoformans, however, were almost always ura5. A total of 10 isolated genes were used as probes to construct a linkage map by hybridizing the probes to the chromosomes separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The linkage map of A and D serotypes of C neoformans were nearly identical but differed from that of C. neoformans var. gattii. The ecological niche of C. neoformans var. gattii remained an enigma until 1990 when it was isolated from Eucalyptus camaldulensis (red river gum tree) in Australia as well as California. The identity of isolates from the trees were confirmed by using a C neoformans ribosomal DNA probe (Gen-probe) and electrophoretic karyotype. \",\n",
       " 'A goal of the Medical Virology Section since the early 1980s has been the elucidation of the mechanisms that permit and regulate the latency and reactivation of the neurotropic human alphaherpesviruses, herpes simplex viruses (HSV) 1 and 2 and the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). These efforts were informed by the rich patient experience being acquired by Section staff through their parallel clinical studies of disease natural history, asymptomatic virus shedding and transmission, and responsiveness to experimental antiviral therapies and candidate vaccines. The dominant thrust of work over the past several years has been to define the cellular distribution of latent VZV DNA in human ganglia and to delineate the biological roles of HSV latency-associated transcripts (LATs). Most work by others has involved the molecular characterization of HSV-1 LATs and their study through creation of mutants bearing targeted deletions in their promoter or transcription domains. This laboratory adopted a different strategy: we study LAT expression and biology in HSV-2 because it is a more important human pathogen, and because the guinea pig model of genital infection is the only one that evinces spontaneous disease reactivation. By 1998 we had defined the promoter elements for the HSV2 LATs, deleted all or some of them from the virus, and studied these mutants using ocular and genital models of infection in mice and guinea pigs wherein it is possible to follow the clinical and virological course of acute infection and spread to regional ganglia, to quantify copies of viral genomes in acutely and latently infected tissues, and to induce reactivation upon ex vivo co-cultivation or by in vivo exposure of animals to heat or ultraviolet light. The work revealed that HSV2 deleted fully for expression of LATs infected animals and established latency normally, but it is impaired for reactivation. Moreover, the Section staff showed that the quantity of latent viral DNA is an essential arbiter of rates of subsequent spontaneous reactivation. Efforts began then to refine techniques for localizing and quantifying latent viral sequences. Scientists in the Section were the first in the field to introduce and standardize methods for real-time PCR using the Taqman system, for isolation of individual cells using laser capture microdissection (LCM), and for creation, breeding and study of mice transgenic for latency sequences. Analyses of these transgenic mice showed that expression of the HSV2 latency region as a transgene had no impact on the course of acute exogenous infection with HSV2, on the establishment of latency or on the potential for reactivation. Work over the past year involved refinement and utilization of a combination of in situ hybridization, LCM, and real-time PCR techniques to determine the cellular distribution of latent HSV-1 and VZV DNA and HSV-1 latency-associated transcripts (LAT) in human sensory ganglia at the single cell level. We found that many more neurons in human ganglia harbor HSV-1 DNA (2-11%) than are positive by in situ hybridization for LATs (0.2-1.5%). The mean number of copies of HSV-1 DNA per cell was 11.3. In fact, most of the HSV-1 DNA positive neurons are LAT-negative by in situ hybridization. We found that HSV-1 DNA was virutally exclusive to neurons and was rarely present in the adjacent satellite cells. The viral DNA load in a neuron is an important, but not the only, determinant of the accumulation of LAT in that neuron. We also found that latent VZV DNA is located in 1.0-6.9% of neurons but rarely, if ever, in satellite cells, contrary to our findings of 16 years ago using in situ hybridization. THe mean number of copies of VZV DNA per cell was 6.9.',\n",
       " '1) Beagle dogs vaccinated once intradermally (i.d.) in each ear pinna with a rabies DNA vaccine expressing the rabies virus G produced elevated levels of neutralizing antibody that persist for more than one year. In contrast, dogs vaccinated with this DNA vaccine in the quadriceps muscle, via gene gun in the ear pinnae, or i.d. in the neck elicit minimal or undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody.2) Beagle dogs vaccinated once i.d. in ear pinnae one year prior to infection are protected 100% against a lethal challenge of a salivary gland homogenate obtained from a rabid dog naturally infected with a coyote rabies virus variant. Dogs vaccinated once i.m. with the DNA vaccine are not protected. 3)Persistent infectious rabies virus and or rabies viral RNA are present in mice 20>500 days after virus injection. Virus and or genome are primarily detected in blood, bone marrow, injected muscle, and the brain spinal cord. Rabies virus genome persists in tissues of 30% of immunodeficient mice injected with an avirulent rabies virus. The sensitivity for detecting viral RNA in persistently-infected mice increases 100-fold using real-time Taq-Man PCR analysis. 4)Viremia studies using Taq-Man PCR analysis to detect viral RNA show that there are 2 phases of viremia in mice experimentally infected intramuscularly with rabies virus. The initial phase occurs immediately and up to 2 days after virus injection. After that time (3-30 days), viral RNA is not detected in the blood of mice that remain free of clinical disease. More importantly, a second viremia occurs in mice that develop clinical disease and are exsanguinated 2-4 days after onset of paralysis. 5) Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PS-ODNs) are potent inhibitors of in vitro rabies virus replication. The antiviral activity increases with the length of the PS-ODN (40mer>20mer>10mer), and is not dependent on a specific oligonucleotide sequence. Experiments are in progress to determine the in vivo antiviral activity of the PS-ODNs.',\n",
       " 'The goal of this project is to understand mechanisms of host defense and immunity against retroviruses. Previous work has defined several mouse genes which influence ability of mice to recover spontaneously from Friend virus complex (FV)-induced leukemia. Some of these genes also influence ability to induce protective immunity to this disease by vaccination with viral protein in adjuvants or expressed in recombinant vaccinia viruses. The most recent work has shown that protective immunity can be induced by both retroviral envelope and gag proteins expressed in vaccinia. Deletion of the amino or carboxy-termini of the gag polyprotein indicated that the amino-terminal half was responsible for the immune protection. This protection was weaker than that induced by the viral envelope protein, but it was successful in mice who were not capable of making a successful immune response to the envelope protein. These results suggested that both envelope and gag proteins should be considered as possible immunogens in constructing vaccines against other retroviruses. The mechanism of protection by immunization with gag protein is under further investigation. ',\n",
       " 'Aleutian mink disease parvovirus (ADV) causes a persistent infection that is restricted in adult animals and is associated with disturbances of immune regulation. Features of Aleutian disease (AD) include polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, plasmacytosis, immune complex disease, interstitial and glomerulonephritis and exceedingly high levels of anti- ADV antibodies. The spectrum of findings resembles those associated with a Th2 pattern of cytokine responses. The scope of this project is to elucidate mechanisms by which ADV infection results in this unusual disorder. We found that levels of the cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased as mink infected with ADV develop disease. Furthermore, amounts of IL-6 mRNA also appeared to increase as mink developed AD. Conditions in which IL-6 is overexpressed in human and mice resemble the clinicopathologic picture of ADV infection in adult mink. Inappropriate production of IL- 6, and possibly other cytokines, during chronic ADV infection may play a role in the generation of the immune disorders. This would be consistent with a Th2 type of immune response. Analysis of transcription suggested that restricted ADV infection may be associated with reduced synthesis of either capsid proteins or nonstructural protein 2 (NS2). Disrupted NS2 synthesis has been found to cause nonpermissive infection for other parvoviruses in a cell type specific fashion. Infected mink do not generate a detectable antibody response against all regions of the various nonstructural (NS) proteins. When sera were tested against fusion proteins containing open reading frames specific for segments of the NS proteins, we found antibodies directed against NS1 specific regions and the amino-terminal region common to all NS proteins, but no reactivity against the NS2 specific ORF. An antibody prepared against the NS2 specific ORF detected a protein of the correct size indicating that NS2 is a bona fide gene product in permissively infected cells. Consequently, NS2 may not be expressed in vivo during ADV infection. This finding might implicate disordered NS2 synthesis in restricted in vivo infection. ',\n",
       " 'It has recently been recognized that some human retroviruses are capable of replicating in the central nervous system. Their participation in CNS pathology is as yet a matter of speculation. We are studying a murine retrovirus (WM-E) which was originally isolated from wild mice and has the capacity to cause a lower-motor-neuron paralytic disease in some strains of laboratory mice with a 12-20 week latency. The primary goal of this project is to identify the cells in the CNS which replicate this virus and the mechanisms by which this virus cause motor neuron pathology. We have prepared a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for WM-E in AKR mice which are tolerant to endogenous retrovirus. These antibodies react with the three viral membrane-associated proteins gp70, p15(E) and P15gag and express no cross-reactivity with endogenous viruses of laboratory mice. Using these antibodies to follow virus replication, we have found that neonatal inoculation of both susceptible (NFS) and resistant (AKR, NZB) strains of mice resulted in quantitatively equivalent levels of WM-E virus replication in the spleen and comparable levels of viremia. We have documented that the virus does indeed replicate in the lumbar spinal cord by both immunohistochemistry and infectious center assay of trypsin collagenase-disrupted tissue. However, no significant difference was found in the levels of virus replication in the lumbar cord of susceptible and resistant strains of mice. In addition, retroviruses which do not cause neurologic disease also replicated in the CNS, but the patterns of replication as detected by EM appear different when compared with that of WM-E. We are currently studying primary cultures of lumbar cord cells in order to identify the specific cell types which are infected by these various viruses. Another retrovirus has now been identified which is unrelated to WM-E, but which also causes paralytic disease in mice. This virus is being molecularly cloned by B. Chesebro and should prove useful in identifying viral genomic sequences responsible for the neuropathology. ',\n",
       " '(1) We completed analyses of detergent-resistant membrane and lipid profiles of human erythrocytes containing hemoglobin C, a mutant hemoglobin known for to protect children against severe forms of falciparum malaria in West Africa. The manuscript on this work is ready for submission. (2) We also completed the assessment of possible nitric oxide (NO) production in intra-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum. This work has been published in Journal of Experimental Parasitology. (3) We also have expanded our biophysical biochemical studies of parasitized erythrocytes including characterization of Zeta potentials associated with the host erythrocyte surface in malaria infection. (4) In this fiscal year, we have started developing a new microscopic technology, termed Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (TIRFM), and combine with novel fluorescence florophore, Tetracysteine. These technologies will be used for Single Molecule Tracking to study dynamic molecular diffusions and interactions of malaria parasite-derived proteins on human erythrocyte membrane. This project will be augmented by cutting-edge imaging technologies, such as Fluorescence Lifetime Microscopy and Quantum Dots. (1) A major transport molecule of human erythrocytes (Band 3) shows clustering in the membrane of human erythrocytes homozygous for hemoglobin C (CC erythrocytes). Erythrocytes that are normal and are homozygous for human hemoglobin (AA) show no such clustering. Our studies have also shown that CC erythrocytes have a clear difference in surface Zeta potential relative to AA erythrocytes. This difference may be a consequence of factors including: (a) hemichrome and serum protein binding to the erythrocyte membrane; (b) protein clustering partially induced by hemichrome aggregation; and or (c) lipid modification due to hemoglobin denaturation and induced oxidation effects. By examining detergent-resistant fractions of membranes, we found that the distribution of molecules including flotillin-1 (a raft marker), band 3 and CD47 are shifted to denser fractions of CC erythrocytes separated by centrifugation. In contrast, a major structural protein of human erythrocytes (spectrin) was not detected in raft fractions from either AA or CC erythrocytes. We also showed that the lipid compositions of CC and AA erythrocytes carry characteristically different levels of phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine, all of which are major components of the erythrocyte membranes inner leaflet. Slight changes in lipid composition modulate phase behavior and domain formation in cellular membranes, resulting in a variety of effects on membrane protein clustering and signal transduction. Flowcytometry showed that hemoglobin C erythrocytes display a higher level of phsopatidylserine which helps for modification of outer leaflet molecular distributions. Using model system with hemoglobin A erythrocytes and a strong oxidizing agent, NaNO2, which induce a higher level of hemichrome, we showed that hemichrome level and Zeta poteintial of hemoglobin A erythrocytes in this model system is similar to those in hemoglobin C erythrocytes. These data suggest that hemichrome formation is a major factor to induce hemoglobin C chacteristics and observed band 3 clusterings and modified PfEMP1 display in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. (3) In 2006 we initiated studies investigating the possible production of NO in asexual stages of the P. falciparum parasite. In FY2007-2008, we made an important progress in this project, confirming NO is produced in asexual (trophozoites) and sexual (gametocyte) stages of P. falciparum parasites. We confirmed that P. falciparum parasites do not depend on L-arginine, classic substrate for NO production in eukaryotic cells, for the source of NO. Instead, a nitrate reductase mechanism is likely to be responsible for nitrogen incorporation and synthesis of nitric oxide in this organism. Using the P. falciparum genomic database, we identified two possible gene candidates that could be responsible for NO synthetic activity in asexual stages of P. falciparum parasites. We confirmed their expressions in P. falciparum cultures by RT-PCR and generated specific antibodies by DNA vaccine technology. Using specific mice antibodies generated in house against PF13_0353 we obtained signals localized in the food vacuole of trophozoite stage P. falciparum parasites. Our findings are described in a recent publication: gPlasmodium falciparum: Food vacuole localization of nitric oxide-derived species in intraerythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite.h Graciela Ostera, Fuyuki Tokumasu, Fabiano Oliveira, Juliana Sa, Tetsuya Furuya, Clarissa Teixeira and James Dvorak. Experimental Parasitology. Vol 120, Issue 1, September 2008, 29-38. This is the first study describing nitric oxide production and function in asexual forms of the P. falciparum parasite. Our initial data indicating a possible NO generation site at the food vacuole, a parasitic compartment involved in hemoglobin degradation, heme detoxification and a target for antimalarial drug action, could have considerable impact in our understanding of these critical parasitic functions. (3) Zeta potential is a measure of cell-surface electrochemical potential. Preliminary data indicate that this potential changes at the surface of the erythrocyte during parasite growth, and that these changes are associated with the deposition of knob-associated proteins and cytoadherence properties of the infected cell: knobless cell line of P. falciparum has lower zeta potential than that of knob expressing cell lines. The cytoadherence assays showed that cytoadherence for knobless parasite lines are abolished, but slightly recovered by removing sialic acid using neuraminidase. Increase in adherence for knob-presenting erythrocytes was also observed. These data indicate that cytoadherence of parasitized erythrocytes to endothelial cells require knobs, but intercellular adhesion was achieved not only by the intermolecular bindings but also non-specific electrostatic interactions. (4) In this fiscal year, we start developing single-molecule tracking technology for P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes to monitor intermolecular interactions in real-time on live cells. This is a challenging project and never done in other laboratories. In this study, we use etetracysteinef tag which only has four cysteine residues but produces reasonably strong fluorescence when it is combined with a biarsenical labeling reagent. Since it is very small tag, much smaller than GFP, we expect that more natural protein trafficking pattern would be monitored. This tag has never used in malaria study before. This single molecule tracking study will also be augmented by quantum dot (QD)-based single molecule technology. This technology can be used for counter-labeling of erythrocytes. For example, using QD-labeled CD47 in live erythrocytes, we showed that the diffusion coefficient of CD47 has two subpopulations: immobile and mobile pools. We found that P. falciparum infection reduced significantly the mobile pool of CD47, showing that P. falciparum infection dramatically modifies the erythrocyte membrane protein mobility. Our preliminary data using cutting-edge FLIM also revealed this modification. We will combine tetracystein, QDs, FLIM, and custom made TIRFM to perform simultaneous multi-protein tracking to study dynamic intermolecular interactions in real time.',\n",
       " \"Several aspects of phagocyte biology have been studied using neutrophils (PMN) and monocytes. Investigation of the subcellular location of fmet-leu-phe, C3bi as well as for cytochrome b suggests these constituents are packaged in a common compartment similar to specific granules. In related studies a series of monoclonal antibodies against the inside of the neutrophil plasma membrane have been developed with the goal of identifying specific secretory granule attachment sites. Studies in exudate PMN have revealed greater than five-fold more fmet-leu-phe receptors than blood PMN, presumably related to receptors mobilized from the intracellular pool. In studies extending our earlier work on neutrophil heterogeneity a monoclonal antibody, 31D8, that binds to a subpopulation of PMN was studied in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The data indicate there are two groups of CML patients; those with 31D8 bright or dull PMN. It is not clear whether or not the CML heterogeneity reflects differences in clonal proliferation. Unexpectedly absence of the 31D8 antigen appeared predictive of progression of CML to the accelerated phase. Studies of IgE turnover in the Hyperimmunoglobulin E-recurrent infection (Job's) syndrome have revealed decreased clearance of IgE in subjects with elevated IgE. This has implications for numerous diseases in which IgE is elevated. In other studies gamma interferon was shown to be a chemoattractant for PMN and monocytes and this may relate to gamma interferon's ability to induce macrophage giant cell formation. \",\n",
       " 'A Giardia lamblia adult mouse model was used to understand mechanisms involved in antigenic variation. Both immune and nonimmune factors are important. In one clone expressing one variant specific surface protein (VSP), antigenic variation occurs in both immunocompetent and nude mice, but fails to occur in SCID mice. However, some clones expressing other VSPs are not continually expressed in SCID mice indicating that VSPs are preferentially maintained or lost by the host. Prior studies used encystation of Giardia lamblia as a means of understanding a relatively simple developmental process. A number of studies showed that protease(s) are essential for encystment to occur. A series of studies were initiated to understand control of nuclear division in Giardia and how structural proteins are altered during encystation and division. Six Mabs to different structural proteins were used to identify the corresponding genes, the homologue of the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 gene in Giardia identified, and antibodies made to it. A Zn finger active compound was found to be effective in the treatment of animals infected with Giardia lamblia. ',\n",
       " 'Leishmania are obligate intracellular protozoan parasites of humans. Within infected patients, various species of this organism inhabit and destroy macrophages within the skin or internal organs (liver, spleen and bone marrow). Thus, they cause either ulcerative, nonhealing, disfiguring cutaneous lesions or degenerative and most often fatal visceral disease. These diseases afflict over 12 million patients in the tropics and neo-tropics worldwide. Our studies are aimed at understanding the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of this organism. In that regard, the basic cell, molecular and developmental biology of Leishmania and related trypanosomatid protozoa are investigated as models of human parasitism. How these parasites are able to survive, access nutrients, multiply and differentiate within their insect vector and mammalian hosts are questions central to understanding the basic parasitic nature and evolutionary adaptations of these organisms. Since these parasites interact directly with their hosts, knowledge of the composition and functions of their surface membranes seems essential. To that end, unique parasite surface membrane enzymes and other physiologically relevant proteins are identified and biochemically characterized to determine their functional roles in the survival of these organisms. Further, the genes encoding such proteins are being identified and characterized for the first time, toward defining their expression and regulation during course of parasite growth, differentiation and development. Further, experiments involving the targeted-deletion of such genes and the production of functionally null mutant parasites are in progress. The viability of such mutants will be tested in situ. Results of the latter studies should demonstrate whether the proteins encoded by these genes are, in fact, essential for the survival of these pathogens within their insect-vector and or mammalian hosts. Thus, the current studies are aimed at defining the intrinsic needs of these organisms and determining their critical nature. In addition, these studies are of practical relevance toward demonstrating whether such parasite enzymes are logical targets for 1) the identification design of new chemotherapeutic drugs, 2) the development of new diagnostic tools and or 3) potential vaccines against these human pathogens.

       " 'A series of HTLV-I cell lines were prepared by in vitro transformation of rabbit blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using HTLV-I. Animals injected with certain infected lines (e.g.RH K34) developed adult T cell leukemia- lymphoma-like disease (ATLL). The majority of rabbit HTLV-I T cell lines (e.g.RH K30), including several derived in the same fashion as the lethal line, cause no overt disease. Results of a detailed study may shed light on why HTLV-I infection in humans causes serious disease in only a small percentage of infected individuals. The labortory has succeeded in defining an HTLV-I molecular clones to use for a study of specific viral genes. Several T cell and fibroblast lines transfected with the clone derived from RH K30 expressed HTLV-I p24 gag protein at levels comparable to the donor RH K30 line. A transfected rabbit cell line, RL-5 K30 was able to transmit HTLV-I infection as measured by both in vitro and in vivo assays. Rabbit and human lymphocytes cocultured with irradiated RL- 5 K30 cells became infected with HTLV-I. Rabbits injected with RL-5 K30 cells produced an HTLV-I antibody response, and HTLV-I was isolated from PBMC beginning 3 months after injection. In order to study HTLV-I factors involved in persistence of viral protein expression, chimeric molecular clones have been constructed by shuffling genes of K30 and K34. An initial result implies that the viral genes other than the LTR region are important for maintenance of p24 expression in transfected RL-5 cells and assignment of the precise region involved in viral expression will be addressed by substituting each of the differences between K30 and K34 in turn. Ability of the molecular clones to infect rabbits in vivo, is being tested by direct intramuscular DNA inoculation. HTLV-I antibodies were detected in the sera obtained from the rabbits injected with K30 plasmid by two months postinjection, HTLV-I specific sequences were detected by PCR from rabbit PBMC DNA and HTLV-I virus was isolated from PBMC culture indicating infection was achieved. Availability of such clones will facilitate functional studies of HTLV-I genes and gene products. ',\n",
       " 'A proposed role for the matrix (MA) domain of the HIV-1 Gag protein is to facilitate the incorporation of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins into virus particles. To characterize functions of HIV-1 MA, including envelope incorporation into virus particles, we introduced over 65 single and double amino acid substitution mutations throughout HIV-1 MA. We demonstrated that single amino acid substitutions in MA residues 12 or 30 blocked the virion incorporation of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, and that this block could be reversed by pseudotyping with heterologous retroviral envelope glycoproteins containing short cytoplasmic tails, or by truncating 104 or 144 amino acids from the cytoplasmic tail of the HIV-1 transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. To map the domain of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail responsible for the block to virion incorporation imposed by the MA mutations, a series of eight additional truncation mutations were constructed between 23 and 93 amino acids from the C- terminus of gp41. The data indicated that virion incorporation of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins with truncations of 23, 30, 51, and 56 amino acids from the C-terminus of gp41 is specifically blocked by the MA amino acid 12 mutation, whereas truncations of greater than 93 amino acids reverse the envelope incorporation defect. These results suggest that residues within a predicted `-helix located between 63 and 87 amino acids from the gp41 C-terminus may interact with MA to facilitate the incorporation of envelope glycoproteins with long cytoplasmic tails into HIV-1 virions. To obtain more information about the role of MA and envelope incorporation, we obtained and analyzed viral revertants of two MA residue 12 mutations. Nucleotide sequencing of the revertants indicated that a Val->Ile substitution at MA amino acid 34 compensated for both of the amino acid 12 mutations, providing support for an interaction between residue 12 and 34 during the envelope incorporation process.

       " \"Having already demostrated that parasite antigen profoundly alters the maturation and function of human dendritic cells, we have used live parasites (infective stage larvae [L3] or microfilariae) to examine, in a more physiological manner, the interaction between host and the parasite focussing in on those interactions that affect immunological outcome. First, using human Langerhans cells and microarray analysis, we have demonstrated that as few as 5 L3 can profoundly alter Langerhans' cell physiology. In contrast, similar numbers of L3s induce very few genes in more mature human dendritic cells (this in contrast to that induced by other parasites). Moreover, the L3s' effect on other cells in the innate immune pathway (naive T cells, NK cells, monocytes) are profoundly different, with the induction of proinflammatory cascades and apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis appears to be a common mechanism by which the filarial parasites influences the host response. Once the immune response to the parasitic infection is established, downregulatory mechanims are induced. The elucidate the mehansims underlying this downregulation seen in chronic filarial helminth infection, we have identified pathways that utilize CTLA4 as well as regulatory T cells (through IL-10) as those that modulate the antigen-specific immune response.\",\n",
       " \"Our laboratory is involved in two central projects. We are producing attenuated lines of human and rodent malarias which should prove useful in the study of both the biochemistry of parasites and the development of immunity to parasites. We have also been characterizing the ribosomal RNA of different malarial parasites. Information from these studies has important ramifications for the development of malaria diagnostics, the understanding of evolutionary relationships among the different malarial species and the understanding of control of the parasite's developmental cycle. \",\n",
       " \"Following our previous therapeutic success with cyclophosphamide (CP) in the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), we have gone on to evaluate the safety and efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) as an alternative therapy in this disease in order to avoid the side effects of CP. Forty-two patients who did not have immediately life-threatening disease were studied. The median follow-up was 33.7 months. Weekly administration of MTX and prednisone resulted in remission of disease in 33 42 patients (78%). Nineteen of the 34 patients achieving remission experienced a relapse of disease. The estimated median time to relapse for all patients achieving remission was 29 months. Eighty percent of these relapses occurred in patients who had discontinued MTX or had reduced their dose to 15 mg week or less. Thus, MTX plus prednisone may be an acceptable alternative form of therapy for selected patients with WG. As part of our continuing efforts to identify less toxic alternative treatments for WG and related diseases, we have initiated a phase I trial of lisofylline in the treatment of WG. Lisofylline is a methylxanthine derivative which functionally blocks pathways of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha signal transduction and has in vitro and in vivo antiinflammatory activity. Because blister studies performed here have demonstrated increased levels of the cytokines in patients with WG, lisofylline may be a useful therapy. Preliminary results suggest that lisofylline may have clinically significant antiiflammatory effects in WG and related diseases. Stenosis of the subglottic trachea (SGS) is a potentially life-threatening complication of WG that requires tracheostomy in up to 50% of cases. We developed a surgical technique for the management of SGS in patients with WG which combines mechanical dilatation of the subglottic trachea with injection of a long-acting glucocorticoid into the stenotic lesion. In 20 patients treated with this technique, none have required tracheostomy and 6 patients with previous tracheostomies were decannulated. Intratracheal dilation-injection therapy provides a safe and effective treatment modality for WG-associated SGS. \",\n",
       " 'Autoreactive T cells that are capable of inducing autoimmune diseases exist in normal adult animals, but are maintained in a dormant or inactive state due to the suppressive functions of regulatory T cells. We have demonstrated that the regulatory T cells can be easily identified in normal lymphoid tissues by co- expression of CD4 and the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25). Transfer of CD4+ CD25- T cells to immunoincompetent mice results in the development of autoimmune disease that can be prevented by co-transfer of CD4+CD25+ cells. Our recent studies have focused on defining the mechanism of action of the CD4+CD25+ in vitro. CD4+CD25+ T cells are completely non-responsive to stimulation via their T cell receptor due to an inability to produce IL-2. When mixed with CD4+CD25- cells, they suppress proliferation by blocking transcription of the IL-2 gene in the CD25- population. Suppression is mediated by a T-T interaction. Addition of IL-2 or anti-CD28 abrogates CD4+CD25+-mediated suppression of proliferation and has been assumed to break suppression. We examined IL-2 mRNA by quantitative PCR in cocultures of mouse CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25- T cells. Although IL-2 gene transcription was inhibited in the presence or absence of IL-2, the addition of anti-CD28 stimulated endogenous IL-2 production. Surprisingly, transcription of IL-2 mRNA was also restored in the cocultures in the presence of anti-IL-2. These results are most compatible with a model in which CD4+CD25+ T cells do not suppress the initial activation of CD4+CD25- T cells, but mediate their suppressive effects following production of IL-2 by the responder cells resulting in both the expansion of the CD4+CD25+ T cells and induction of their suppressor function. We have employed microarray technology to identify several genes that encode factors that may be related to the suppressive function of CD4+CD25+ cells. Resting CD25+ T cells selectively express the glucocorticoid induced TNF receptor (GITR, TNFRSF18) and engagement of this molecule by antibody or by its ligand (GITR-L) abrogates suppression mediated by CD4+CD25+ T cells. We have generated monoclonal antibodies to the GITR-L and shown that it has a unique tissue distribution with expression being limited to resting B cells and dendritic cells. Expression of GITR-L on antigen presenting cells is down-regulated following TLR signaling in vitro. Using combinations of CD4+CD25+ T cells from wild type and GITR deficient mice in coculture experiments, we found that ligation of GITR on CD25- responder T cells, not on CD25+ suppressor cells, was required to abrogate suppression. In the absence of CD4+CD25+ T cells, GITR deficient T cells mounted proliferative responses similar to those of wild-type animals, although they were totally suppressed in the presence of physiological numbers of CD25+ T cells. Our results suggest that GITR GITR-L interactions provide a previously undefined signal that renders effector T cells resistant to the inhibitory effects of CD4+CD25+ T cells. Thus, the downregulation of GITR-L expression subsequent to secondary inflammatory signals may facilitate CD25-mediated suppression and prevent the deleterious consequences of an exuberant effector cell response. In addition to autoimmune disease, our studies have demonstrated that CD4+CD25+ T cells also play an important role in the control of the immune response to infectious agents and in the immune response to tumors. Thus, CD4+CD25+ T cells have pleiotropic effects on immune responses in autoimmunity, tumor immunity, and infectious disease. Manipulation of regulatory T cell function should represent a novel adjunct to the therapy of several diseases.',\n",
       " 'Rabbit Immune Repertoires for Generation and Humanization of Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies The rabbit immune repertoire has long been a rich source of diagnostic polyclonal antibodies. Now it also holds great promise as a source of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Rabbits with the rare b9 allotype are excellent sources for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. We generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies from these rabbits. Broadly neutralizing antibodies against receptor-activated epitopes on the N-heptad repeat region (NHR) of HIV-1 gp41 are elicited during natural infection and by immunization. Our collaborator Dr. Michael Zwick rescued HIV-1-neutralizing anti-NHR antibodies from immune phage display libraries that were prepared from an HIV-1 infected individual, and from b9 rabbits that we immunized with a mimetic of the NHR inner trimeric coiled-coil previously described by Dr. C. Bewley, NIDDK. The human and rabbit monoclonal antibodies bind to overlapping epitopes on the NHR trimer, generate distinct binding profiles against a panel of gp41 mimetic proteins and neutralize primary HIV-1 from various clades with modest potency using a pseudotyped virus assay. An examination of the differing abilities of the antibodies to neutralize different viruses bearing identical NHR sequences has revealed a particular restriction to neutralization that appears to be steric in nature, rather than dependent on viral entry kinetics. Taken together, the results indicate that broadly neutralizing antibodies, albeit currently of limited potency, are elicited against the NHR trimer of HIV-1 gp41 during natural infection and by immunization. For vaccine design, the newly selected antibody panel can be used in optimizing the NHR trimeric coiled-coil to favorably display neutralizing epitopes (Nelson, J. D., Jensen, R., Bewley, C. A., Brunel, F. M., Louis, J. M., Clore, G. M., Mage, R. G., Dawson, P. E., Burton, D. R., and Zwick, M. B. 2008 (1) The laboratory of Dr. C. Rader (NCI) isolated monoclonal antibodies selective for all three members of the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) family. NgR family members are cell surface proteins involved in the development, plasticity, and regeneration of the central nervous system. NgR1, NgR2, and NgR3 are primarily expressed by neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and believed to limit axonal growth and sprouting following CNS injury. In an attempt to define the expression and decipher the function of individual members of the Nogo-66 receptor family, we generated selective rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Venkatesh K, Chivatakarn O, Lee H, Joshi PS, Kantor DB, Newman BA, Mage R, Rader C, Giger RJ, The Nogo-66 receptor homolog NgR2 is a sialic acid-dependent receptor selective for myelin-associated glycoprotein. J Neurosci. 25:808-22, 2005). We then used phage display technology to generate rabbit monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the same immune repertoires. We obtained mAbs with nanomolar affinity to epitopes that are specific for NgR1 and NgR2, respectively, but at the same time conserved between mouse, rat, and human orthologs. Employing phage display vector pC3C, a newly designed phagemid optimized for the generation and selection of Fab libraries with human constant domains, rabbit mAbs were selected from chimeric rabbit human Fab libraries, characterized in terms of specificity, affinity, and amino acid sequence, and finally converted to chimeric rabbit human IgG. Strong and specific recognition of cell surface bound Nogo-66 receptor family members by chimeric rabbit human IgG was demonstrated using immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation. The rabbit mAbs together with their amino acid sequences constitute a defined panel of species cross-reactive reagents in infinite supply for investigations toward a functional role of the Nogo-66 receptor family in and beyond the CNS (1) and Venkatesh K, Raiker S, Lee A, Lee-Osbourne J, Wychowski T, Hofer T, Mage R, Rader C, and Giger RJ, Development of Nogo Receptor Variants with enhanced Ligand Binding Properties: Insights into the structural basis of the Myelin Associated Glycoprotein Nogo Receptor 2 association-- manuscript in preparation. In a collaboration with Drs. Wingfield, Stahl and Watts, we immunized b9 rabbits with recombinant HIV rev and HBeAg (Core e-antigen of Hepatitis B) for phage display and selection of Fab against conformational epitopes to be used for cocrystallization. Libraries generated from these immunized rabbits have been screened and Fab of interest recovered and sequenced. The above studies derive from work that characterized rabbit pre-immune and post-immune repertoire development. We studied genes of the rabbit immune system using techniques of molecular biology and immunology. In species such as mouse and human, generation of combinatorial diversity through use of different VH and VL genes in immunoglobulin VHDJH and VLJL rearrangements can be a major contributor to the primary antibody repertoire. In rabbits, the contribution of the combinatorial mechanism to heavy chain diversity is minimal as only a few VH genes are rearranged and expressed. This resembles chicken antibody formation. Rabbit appendix and chicken bursa of Fabricius are primary lymphoid organs where the B cell antibody repertoire develops in germinal centers mainly by a gene conversion-like process. As in the chicken, the 3-prime most VH1 gene is rearranged in most rabbit B lymphocytes. Somatic hypermutation and gene conversion contribute to primary diversification in appendix of young rabbits or in bursa of Fabricius of embryonic and young chickens and also to secondary diversification during immune responses in germinal centers (GCs)(Mage RG, Lanning D, Knight KL,B cell and antibody repertoire development in rabbits: The requirement of gut-associated lymphoid tissues.

       " 'The merozoite interacts in a receptor-specific manner with the erythrocyte surface and is the stage upon which immunity may work to block invasion. Thus, merozoite surface components are of interest because of their role in erythrocyte recognition and as antigens for induction of protective immunity. We are identifying P. knowlesi, P. vivax and P. falciparum receptors for attachment to monkey and human erythrocytes. The components in the junction and the signaling after merozoites make contact with erythrocytes is also under study. ',\n",
       " 'Activating mutations in the c-kit protooncogene codon 816 are found in most patients with systemic mastocytosis involving the bone marrow. Since c-kit encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, inhibition of this pathway by drugs such as imatinib (STI-571; Gleevec) has been evaluated as a potential therapeutic strategy in mast cell disease. Using primary mast cells obtained from patient bone marrow aspirates, Gleevec has been shown to exert a potent cytotoxic activity on mast cells carrying c-kit with a wild-type codon 816. On the other hand, the drug was relatively ineffective in killing mast cells carrying a codon 816 c-kit mutation. To complement these observations, a patient with a previously undescribed variant of mastocytosis was found to have a novel activating mutation in the transmembrane portion of c-kit, and showed a dramatic response to imatinib. Eosinophils represent a hematopoietic lineage which is involved heavily in the pathogenesis of some allergic diseases such as asthma and drug reactions. Their numbers are pathologically increased in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), a disease with protean presentations similar to mastocytosis. One variant of HES with myeloproliferative features (MP-HES) has been observed to be associated with elevated plasma tryptase levels and abnormally shaped mast cells. In collaboration with LPD, we thus investigated the pathologic features of mast cells in MP-HES. We found a unique mast cell phenotype with aberrant surface expression of CD25 and lack of CD2. C-kit codon 816 mutations, generally detected in mastocytosis, were absent in MP-HES mast cells. Patients with this disease variant had the recently described fusion of the Fip1-like 1 gene to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene. Most importantly, all patients with HES and aberrant mast cells treated with imatinib demonstrated a clinical and hematologic response in this otherwise incurable disease. This study showed that that determination of serum tryptase levels and mast cell phenotype appears to be a sensitive marker of a myeloproliferative variant of MP-HES and helps to identify patients who may respond to therapy with imatinib. In collaboration with the TCBS, NCI, we have also investigated the effects of 17-AAG on mast cells carrying wild type and mutated c-kit. 17-AAG is a benzoquinoid ansamycin antibiotic, which binds to heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), and causes destabilization of various hsp90-dependent kinases important in oncogenesis. We showed that treatment of the HMC-1 cell line harboring the D816V c-kit mutation with 17-AAG caused both the level and activity of KIT to be down-regulated as early as 2 hours following drug exposure. These data were validated using Cos-7 cells transfected with wild type and mutated c-kit. In addition, neoplastic mast cells isolated from patients with mastocytosis and incubated with 17-AAG ex vivo were selectively sensitive to the drug, compared to the mononuclear fraction as a whole. These data provide compelling evidence that 17-AAG may be effective in the treatment of mastocytosis, as well as other c-kit related diseases including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and some sub-types of acute myelogenous leukemia and germ-cell tumors. We are currently in the process of writing a clinical protocol to test the effects of 17-AAG in mastocytosis, in collaboration with investigators from NCI. In order to help interpretation of these future clinical trials, standardized response criteria were formulated in collaboration with other researchers in the field.',\n",
       " 'Attachment of Leishmania promastigotes to the midgut lining of the sand fly is crucial to the successful completion of their life cycle in the fly, serving to prevent excretion of developing promastigotes along with the bloodmeal remnants. Lipophosphoglycan (LPG), the major glycoconjugate on the surface of Leishmania promastigotes, has been implicated as the ligand-mediating midgut attachment. The involvement of LPG side-chain sugars in the species-specific attachment of Leishmania parasites to their vectors has been most clearly demonstrated for L. major and P. papatasi, for which side-chains terminating in beta-galactose residues are required. The nature of the LPG receptor in sand flies has remained largely undefined. PpGalec, a cDNA encoding a novel tandem repeat galectin, was identified by high-throughput screening of a midgut library of Phlebotomus papatasi. Expression of PpGalec in P. papatasi is strongly upregulated in adult females and is restricted to midgut tissue. The binding specificity of rPpGalec is restricted to Leishmania promastigotes bearing poly-Gal (b1-3) side chains on their LPG. PpGalec is distributed throughout the abdominal and thoracic midgut and localized on the luminal surface of midgut cells. Most importantly, antibodies against PpGalec inhibited in vitro midgut binding of L. major PG and parasites and severely impaired parasite development and survival in the insect midgut. The use of RNA interference in silencing the expression of PpGal is being developed. Other genes targeted for silencing by RNAi include those encoding chymoptrypsin (PpChym2), involved in bloodmeal digestion, and chitinase, responsible for the breakdown of the peritrophic membrane. The first analysis of the regulation of genes encoding the main enzymes involved in bloodmeal digestion, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, and chitinase, is being completed.',\n",

A strong but not complete degree of protection to challenge was demonstrated in several previously infected Patas monkeys. The presence of intestinal mast cells appears to be a prominent feature of chronic strongyloides infection in the monkey. Increasing experience with the immediate skin test composed of somatic and metabolic larval antigens indicates that it is useful for diagnostic purposes in human infections. Reaction sizes for positive tests have been determined. Analysis of larval antigens using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immuno-blotting has been initiated. ',\n",
       " 'Hamsters provide a unique experimental model to investigate the function of pentraxin proteins in health and disease. This is because hamsters have a pentraxin, a homolog of Serum Amyloid P (SAP) protein called Female Protein (FP) that is sex linked in its expression. Administration of estrogen enhances the hepatic synthesis of this protein FP(SAP) in the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) and also enhances the formation of amyloid. On the other hand, in the Armenian hamster (Cricetus migratorius) estrogen administration down regulates FP(SAP) synthesis in the liver and in addition it induces a profound hepatobiliary dysfunction and liver cancer. These effects of estrogen on liver are mediated by hepatic estrogen receptor and we are able to alter this interaction by changing the animals diet. This may be caused by compounds in foods (phytoestrogens) that also react with estrogen receptor. The physiological advantages of SAP(FP) under sex hormone control is unknown, although this hormonal control is quite different even in closely related (same genus) hamster species. For example, FP(SAP) in another mesocricetus hamster, the Turkish hamster, (Mesocricetus brandti), is structurally similar (97.5%) to that in Syrian hamster, yet lower serum levels are associated with a distinct paucity of amyloidosis in the Turkish hamster.

       " 'Persistent infection of mink with Aleutian mink disease parvovirus (ADV) leads to progressive immune disorder characterized by high levels of antiviral antibodies, hypergammaglobulinemia, plasmacytosis, and immune complex disease. Virus is not neutralized in vivo and ADV exists in infectious immune complexes. Isolates of ADV differ markedly in their ability to induce AD; some like ADV-Utah and ADV-TR are highly pathogenic in vivo, but are replication defective for CRFK cells. The cell-culture ADV-G is replication competent for CRFK, but replicates poorly, if at all, in mink and does not cause progressive disease. A major goal of this project is to correlate specific DNA sequences of the ADV genome to functional correlates, such as pathogenicity determinants and strain variation. Another major goal is to study the actual structure of the ADV virion. Understanding of the structure at high resolution will enable us to (a) map epitopes and pathogenicity determinants to discreet coordinates on the viral particle, (b) define sequences necessary for virus assembly. A summary of the results obtained within the last year includes: * Structural studies of ADV. Using cryo-electron microscopy of virions expressed by recombinant baculoviruses, the structure of ADV has been resolved to 22 Angstroms. The surface of the virion has several unique features not observed in other parvoviruses. Crystallization studies have been initiated. Full-length capsid proteins have also been expressed in E. coli and Pichia pastoris and purified to near homogeneity. Methods to drive self-assembly of these proteins into particles are being developed. * Analysis of chimeric virus constructions. Additional full length clones chimeric between ADV-G and ADV-Utah have been analyzed. Complex determinants for in vitro replication competence map to sequences within the capsid proteins. Detailed mapping indicates that non-contiguous sequences interact or \"cross-talk\" to form these determinants. Two chimeras, replication competent for CRFK, were found to induce viremia and anti-ADV antibody in adult mink. ',\n",
       " 'Scrapie is a naturally occurring spongiform encephalopathy of sheep and goats which causes clinical and pathological changes similar to those of Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Kuru diseases of man. The infectious agent is markedly resistant to agents that inactivate most viruses and disease results in no detectable host immune response. The intimate association of scrapie with host protein may account for many of its unusual features. In order to obtain agent free of tissue contaminants, we have sought to establish high titered scrapie infected tissue culture cell lines. Neuroblastoma cell lines were successfully infected with scrapie agent and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis for scrapie-specific proteins and for the presence of the \"prion\" protein. No protein unique to either the uninfected or infected culture was identified. Attempts to metabolically label scrapie associated nucleic acids were also unsuccessful. Although the cell line maintains significant infectivity, it may be too little to allow detection of certain Sc related functions. Therefore, an attempt will be made to clone infected cells from the cultures thus enriching for Sc related functions. In order to study the relation of the prion protein to scrapie disease a cDNA clone of the scrapie prion protein (PrP27-30) was isolated using an oligonucleotide probe based on the predicted mRNA sequence of a portion of this protein. The partial DNA sequence of this clone indicated that it was identical to the predicted PrP27-30 mRNA. Hybridization of this clone detected a 2.4-2.5 kb mRNA band in both scrapie-infected and uninfected mouse and hamster brain, but not in spleen or liver. Thus, PrP27-30 mRNA was not scrapie-specific, but instead appeared to encode a normal brain protein. Similar approaches will be used to search for scrapie specific markers. ',\n",
       " 'All mammalian species contain a very large number of endogenous retrovirus elements acquired by germline infection over the course of evolution. In humans retroviral elements represent approximately 8% of the genome and their number approaches the total number of encoded genes. Many endogenous retrovirus elements are defective, however some contain an entire complement of functional viral genes characteristic of replication-competent exogenous retroviruses. Although the expression of most endogenous retroviruses is largely suppressed in the host, the production of retroviruses or their gene products during development and during certain physiological or pathological states is well documented. Little is known about the control of retrovirus expression or the influence of such expression on the physiology or pathology of the host. An extensively investigated group of endogenous retroviruses are those giving rise to polytropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) in mice. Polytropic MuLVs are formed by recombination of exogenous ecotropic MuLVs with endogenous envelope sequences present in the genomes of inbred mouse strains. The recombinant polytropic viruses exhibit an altered infectious host range and utilize a cell surface receptor distinct from the receptor utilized by ecotropic MuLVs. In several instances polytropic MuLVs have been directly implicated in pathogenesis, including the induction of proliferative, immunological, and neurological disorders. The generation of variants after infection results in a mixed retrovirus infection. One aspect of this project involves studies of the interactions of retroviruses in mixed infections. Upon co-inoculation of polytropic and ecotropic MuLVs in mice we have observed profound effects on the infectious spread of the polytropic virus, concomitant with a greatly enhanced neuropathogenicity. This phenomenon appears to be mediated by packaging of polytropic viral genomes within ecotropic virus particles. Another aspect of our studies involves the characterization of the family of endogenous retroviruses that exhibit gene sequences that are homologous to the sequences found in recombinant polytropic MuLVs and their participation in recombination. The participation of these endogenous retroviruses in recombination is not random and is different upon infection of mice with different exogenous viruses. We have characterized the endogenous retroviruses in NFS N mice that could potentially give rise to the recombinant viruses and found that each could be distinguished by small nucleotide sequence differences. Comparison of the endogenous viruses to recombinant viruses derived after inoculation of an exogenous ecotropic MuLV indicated that only 3 of the approximately 25 to 30 endogenous retroviruses frequently participate in recombination. Furthermore, these studies suggested a likely mechanism for the specificity of recombination observed with different exogenous viruses. In additional studies we have found upon infection of mice with exogenous viruses, that viral sequences characteristic of intact mouse endogenous retroviruses are transferred to and replicate in cell lines derived from other species. The mobilization of endogenous retroviruses by infection with exogenous retroviruses is unprecedented and may have important implications for the involvement of endogenous retroviruses in disease processes. FY 2003 advance:All mammalian species contain a large number of retrovirus elements in their genomes that have accumulated by germ line infection over the course of evolution. The elements are expressed in a controlled manner during development and in certain pathological conditions and may play physiological or pathological roles in the host. We have characterized a group of endogenous retrovirus sequences in NFS N mice that are known to be participants in the induction of proliferative diseases as well as other disorders. Their particcipation is mediated by recombination with exogenous retroviruses to generate new viruses, termed polytropic MuLVs that exhibit an altered host range of infection. It is known that the endogenous polytropic proviruses are not equally active in recombination and that recombination differs with different exogenous viruses. It is not known, however, precisely which of the endogenous elements recombine or are expressed in the host. This has been elusive because of the very close similarity of the endogenous sequences to one another. Our findings indicate that the proviruses are distinguishable by sequence heterogeneity. In addition, three distinct groups of proviruses were described, one of which is ancestral to the other groups. The latter group reflects features of a phylogenetic intermediate linking the polytropic MLVs to another MLV group termed the xenotropic MLVs. This study has identified distinguishing characteristics of the proviruses that should facilitate a more precise description of their expression in mice and their participation in recombination to generate new retroviruses, and also provided insight into the evolution of endogenous retroviral elements in the host. Methods: Tissue culture, retrovirus infectious assays,PCR,RT PCR,DNA sequencing, electrophoresis, immunohistochemistry. Goals and Objectives: A major goal of this project is the elucidation of the effects of genetic alterations of retroviruses on infection and the induction of pathology. Towards this end we hope to better understand the generation of retrovirus variants by point mutation and recombination. Other goals of this project are to gain a better understanding of the origins of endogenous retroviruses and to determine characteristics that facilitate their expression in the animal as well as their participation in recombination to generate variants. Research Significance: Retrovirus infection and replication in the host leads to genetic variation. Such variation can be the result of point mutations during replication, or recombination with endogenous retrovirus genes that are present in all mammalian species. A consequence of variation in the host is a mixed retrovirus infection. Examples of mixed virus infections resulting from genetic alteration include the generation of HIV variants in humans as a result of point mutation and the generation of polytropic viruses in mice by recombination of inoculated ecotropic murine retroviruses with endogenous retroviral genes. Although interactions of retroviruses are well documented, a role for such interactions in the replication and pathogenicity of the viruses is not well understood. Our studies provide a clear demonstration that mixed retrovirus infections can profoundly influence the replication and pathogenicity of retroviruses. Our studies of the endogenous retroviruses in mice provided important insights into their evolutionary relationships and facilitated a more complete description of the recombination process in the host. The finding that intact endogenous retroviruses may be mobilized by infection with exogenous viruses may have far reaching implications regarding the role of endogenous retroviruses in pathogenic processes. Future Plans: The finding that most endogenous polytropic retroviruses in mice are distinguishable by sequence heterogeneity enabled us to precisely identify the three endogenous retroviruses that frequently participate in recombination and to gain insight into structural features that influence the specific interaction of different endogenous retroviruses with different exogenous viruses. Why only 3 endogenous polytropic retroviruses among the 25 to 30 present in the genome participate in recombination is not yet known. We intend to precisely identify the endogenous retroviruses that are expressed in uninfected mice as well as mice infected with exogenous retroviruses. These analyses will determine if the participation of the endogenous retroviruses in recombination reflects their expression in the mice and if this expression is altered by exogenous virus infection. The observation that intact endogenous retroviruses may be mobilized by exogenous retrovirus infection is unprecedented and may have implications in the involvement of endogenous retroviruses in disease processes. Additional studies into this phenomenon will identify which endogenous retroviruses are mobilized by exogenous retrovirus infection and if the endogenous viruses spread in the host. ',\n",
       " 'Procedures have been developed for the use of vaccinia virus as a eukaryotic expression vector. A chimeric gene is formed by ligating vaccinia virus transcriptional regulatory signals to a foreign protein coding sequence. Homologous recombination is used to insert the chimeric gene into a non-essential region of the vaccinia virus genome. To facilitate the formation and isolation of recombinant virus, new plasmid vectors have been constructed which direct the insertion of the chimeric gene together with the E. coli Beta-galactosidase gene into the thymidine kinase locus. Recombinant virus is then selected on the basis of the thymidine kinase negative phenotype and or staining with a Beta-galactosidase indicator dye. The recombinant viruses produced in this manner are stable and have a wide host range for tissue culture cells and animals. At least 25,000 base pairs of DNA can be inserted into the vaccinia virus genome without destroying infectivity. To optimize expression, the prokaryotic gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was inserted into vaccinia virus under control of different promoters. This system has been used to express genes from a variety of infectious agents including herpes simplex virus type 1, hepatitis B virus, influenza virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and rabies virus. Animals vaccinated with each of the above recombinants were protected against challenge with the corresponding virus. ',\n",
       " 'A number of mouse chromosomal genes have been described which affect the susceptibility of mice to retrovirus-induced neoplastic disease. These genes include endogenous retroviral sequences, mouse cellular genes which facilitate or restrict virus replication, and proto- oncogenes disrupted by viral insertion. In the process of characterizing new common viral insertions in tumors induced by Abelson and Moloney MuLVs, we identified two new integration sites on the same chromosome, Chromosome 10. We defined the close genetic and physical distance between these insertion sites and the previously described oncogene Myb on this Chromosome, but suggest that these insertions may disrupt other oncogenic sequences in this region. In other experiments, we began analysis of several crosses involving DBA 2J mice which carries a locus responsible for resistance to MCF subtype of viruses, Rmcf. We defined the genetic map location of Rmcf, we identified an additional resistance gene in these same crosses which maps to Chr 1, and we are following inheritance of Rmcf through serial backcrosses to M. castaneus which lacks endogenous MCF viruses. These experiments should help determine whether Rmcf represents an endogenous provirus expression of which blocks viral cell surface receptors. Finally, we used a fragment of the recently clone amphotropic viral cell surface receptor to map the mouse gene to Chromosome 8. ',\n",
       " 'As part of the effort to map and sequence the human genome, we have been involved in an ongoing effort to develop a multilocus genetic map of the mouse as the model mammalian system. Most of this work has been accomplished by the genetic analysis of the progeny of two genetic crosses, an interspecies and an intersubspecies backcross. DNAs from the progeny of these crosses have been typed for a variety of polymorphic reference loci to permit mapping of unknown markers to specific positions on the linkage map. These studies have resulted in the chromosomal mapping of a large number of genes including various genes expressed in nervous tissue, cyclin genes, heat shock proteins, transcriptional regulators, microtubule associated protein genes and homeobox genes. Several of these genes map at or near known mouse mutations and therefore are potential candidates for these mutations. Thus, one gene specifically expressed in brain was mapped near the coloboma neurological mutation and shown to be deleted in mutant coloboma mice. Another gene encoding a major stuctural component of cartilage was mapped near the cmd (cartilage matrix deficiency) mutation, and cmd mice were shown to have a 7 b deletion of this gene. ',\n",
       " 'Poxviruses encode enzymes and factors needed for transcription and replication of their genomes within the cytoplasm of infected cells. Vaccinia virus, the prototypic member of the poxvirus family, provides a unique system for combining biochemical and genetic approaches for investigating mechanisms of gene regulation, mRNA biosynthesis, and DNA replication. Studies with vaccinia virus indicated that the genes are divided into three temporal classes - early, intermediate and late. Each gene class has a consensus DNA promoter sequence and corresponding transcription factors that interact with the virus-encoded multisubunit RNA polymerase. The transcription system for early genes is packaged within the infectious virus particle during its assembly, whereas the factors for intermediate and late gene transcription are synthesized successively after infection.The DNA is synthesized as concatemers that are resolved into unit length genomes and packaged during virus assembly.',\n",
       " 'Hepatitis viruses. Clinical samples from patients with acute or chronic non-A, B, C, D, E hepatitis in the United States are being studied for biological, serological or molecular evidence of transmissible agents. Patients with fulminant non-A to E hepatitis remain a diagnostic enigma and may be infected with one or more previously unrecognized viruses. We are attempting to discover the etiology of this disease. Evidence for the existence of an additional water-borne hepatitis virus has come from our seroepidemiologic studies in India, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. We are attempting to transmit an agent from clinical specimens of such patients. Hepatitis E virus may be emerging as a greater public health problem than previously thought. We are studying its epidemiology in developing and industrialized countries worldwide. Serologic evidence of infection of swine with hepatitis E virus (HEV) was obtained. A new and unique HEV strain was recovered from infected swine and characterized. It was shown to have a worldwide distribution. Seroepidemiological studies of swine handlers and matched blood donors have shown an excess of antibody to HEV in swine handlers, suggesting that the virus may be zoonotically spread. Similar serologic evidence for infection of wild rats with HEV has also been obtained and the infecting agent is being sought. To date we have successfully transmitted the agent from rats trapped in Los Angeles to laboratory rats of the same species (Rattus norvegicus). However, transmission has been difficult, suggesting that the virus replicates at low titer. We have prepared a relatively high-titered pool of the virus in SCID rats. Studies to determine if rat HEV is linked to human infection are in progress. Modern techniques of molecular biology have been used to discover new viruses in recent years. These are now being applied to prospectively collected sera from patients with transfusion-associated hepatitis in a search for new hepatitis viruses that may cause up to 15% of such hepatitis in the US. In an attempt to increase the sensitivity of specific virus discovery technologies (i.e., those capable of amplifying unique sequences without regard to the sequence), we have introduced modifications to existing techniques that have improved the sensitivity of the assay. Using the new technology, we have discovered two previously unrecognized bovine parvoviruses that contaminate most lots of bovine serum. This finding has implications for the safety of biologicals that are prepared with bovine serum. Kawasaki Disease is a life-threatening illness of young children. It has the epidemiologic characteristics of an infectious disease. The HVS and MHS are attempting to transmit a putative agent from acute phase clinical samples of children with Kawasaki Disease to nonhuman primates. Preliminary results have been promising.',\n",
       " 'A cold adapted influenza A reassortant virus vaccine was shown to be poorly immunogenic at a dose of 106TCID50 in infants less than six months of age, whereas it was highly immunogenic in slightly older children. These results indicate that young age decreases the response to the hemagglutinin of the influenza A virus and suggest that higher doses of vaccine and a multi-dose schedule of immunization will be required for successful immunization in this age group. Such studies are in progress. The bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) vaccine was found to be satisfactorily attenuated, stable genetically, poorly transmissible, and immunogenic in seronegative infants and young children. Studies of this promising candidate in the target population of the very young seronegative infant and in older seronegative infants and children are in progress. The cp45 human PIV3 vaccine also was found to be safe, satisfactorily infectious, genetically stable, and immunogenic in seronegative infants and children. A CRADA is being developed to accelerate evaluation of this promising candidate vaccine strain. Live attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidates are currently being evaluated in Phase 1 trials in infants and young children. One subgroup A virus vaccine that contains both host-range and ts mutations, namely RSV A2 cpts-248 955, is infectious in young seropositive vaccinees and, importantly, the ts phenotype of the virus shed is stable. This vaccine is currently being studied in seronegative infants and children. The evaluation of three to four other candidate subgroup A and B vaccine candidates will begin this coming year. ',\n",
       " 'HPIV1 Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV1) is a significant cause of severe respiratory tract disease in infants and young children for which a vaccine is needed. The complete genomic sequence of HPIV1 strain Washington 20993 1964 (Wash 64) was recently determined, and wild type recombinant HPIV1 (rHPIV1) was recovered from an HPIV1 antigenomic cDNA. In the present study, we sought to attenuate HPIV1 by the importation of one or more known attenuating point mutations from several heterologous paramyxoviruses into homologous sites in HPIV1. The introduced mutations were derived from three attenuated paramyxoviruses: (i) HPIV3cp45, a live-attenuated HPIV3 vaccine candidate containing multiple attenuating mutations, (ii) the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cpts530 virus with an attenuating mutation in the L polymerase protein, and (iii) a murine PIV1 (MPIV1) attenuated by a mutation in the accessory C protein. Although each of the imported mutations had previously been shown to be attenuating in their native background, not all conferred an attenuation phenotype in rHPIV1. However, rHPIV1 mutants bearing a single imported mutation in C, any of three different mutations in L, or a pair of mutations in F exhibited a 100-fold or greater reduction in replication in the upper or lower respiratory tract of hamsters. Both temperature sensitive (ts) (mutations in the L and F proteins) and non-ts (the mutation in the C protein) attenuating mutations were identified. rHPIV1 mutants containing a combination of two or three mutations in L were generated that were more attenuated than viruses bearing the individual mutations, showing that the systematic accretion of mutations can yield progressive increases in attenuation. Hamsters immunized with any of five rHPIV1 mutants bearing one or two mutations developed neutralizing antibodies and were resistant to challenge with wild type HPIV1. Thus, importation of attenuating mutations from heterologous viruses is an effective means for rapidly identifying mutations that attenuate HPIV1 and for generating live-attenuated HPIV1 vaccine candidates. The paramyxovirus large polymerase protein (L) is highly conserved at the amino acid level between human parainfluenza virus type 1 and type 3 (HPIV1 and HPIV3). The Y942H and L992F temperature sensitive (ts) and attenuating amino acid substitution mutations, previously identified in the L polymerase of the HPIV3-cp45 vaccine candidate, were introduced into homologous positions of the L polymerase of recombinant HPIV1 (rHPIV1). In rHPIV1, the Y942H mutation specified the ts phenotype in vitro and the attenuation (att) phenotype in hamsters whereas the L992F mutation specified neither phenotype. Each of these two mutations in both HPIV3-cp45 and rHPIV1 was generated by a single nucleotide substitution and, therefore, had the potential to readily revert to a codon specifying the wild type amino acid residue. To generate rHPIV1 ts viruses with different levels of attenuation and with enhanced genetic stability, HPIV1 recombinant cDNAs were molecularly engineered to specify each of the other 18 amino acids at position 942 and 17 at position 992 of the L protein. Thirteen rHPIV1 codon substitution mutants with alternative amino acid substitutions at position 942 and 10 with substitutions at position 992 were viable. At position 942, rHPIV1 mutants with a similar level of temperature sensitivity and attenuation as the rHPIV1-Y942H mutant were identified, several of which require three nucleotide substitutions in codon 942 to generate a wild type Tyr codon. One such mutant, rHPIV1-Y942A, exhibited increased genetic and phenotypic stability upon serial passage in vitro at successively elevated restrictive temperatures. At position 992, two recombinants, rHPIV1-L992V and rHPIV1-L992C, were obtained that, in contrast to rHPIV1-L992F, possessed the ts and att phenotypes. These findings identify codon substitution mutations that specify increased genetic stability and or increased attenuation, properties that are highly desirable for mutations present in a live attenuated HPIV1 vaccine. HMPV The growth properties and antigenic relatedness of the CAN98-75 (CAN75) and the CAN97-83 (CAN83) HMPV strains, which represent the two distinct HMPV genetic lineages and exhibit 5% and 63% amino acid divergence in the F and G proteins, respectively, were investigated in vitro and in rodents and non-human primates. Both strains replicated to high titers (>= 6.0 log10) in the upper respiratory tract of hamsters and to moderate titers (>= 3.6 log10) in the lower respiratory tract. The two lineages exhibited 48% antigenic relatedness based on reciprocal cross-neutralization assay using post-infection hamster sera, and infection with each strain provided a high level of resistance to reinfection with the homologous or heterologous strain. Hamsters immunized with a recombinant human parainfluenza virus type 1 (rHPIV1) expressing the fusion F protein of the CAN83 strain (rHPIV1-F83) developed a serum antibody response that efficiently neutralized virus from both lineages and were protected from challenge with either HMPV strain. This indicates that the HMPV F protein is a major antigenic determinant that mediates extensive cross-lineage neutralization and protection. Both HMPV strains replicated to low titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract of rhesus macaques but induced high levels of serum HMPV-neutralizing antibodies effective against both lineages. The level of HMPV replication in chimpanzees was moderately higher, and infected animals developed mild colds. HMPV replicated the most efficiently in the respiratory tract of African green monkeys, and the infected animals developed a high level of HMPV serum neutralizing antibodies (1:500 to 1:1000) effective against both lineages. Reciprocal cross-neutralization assays using post-infection sera from all three primate species indicated that CAN75 and CAN83 are 64%-99% related antigenically. HMPV infected chimpanzees and African green monkeys were highly protected from challenge with the heterologous HMPV strain. Taken together, the results in hamsters and nonhuman primates support the conclusion that the two HMPV genetic lineages are highly related antigenically and are not distinct antigenic subtypes or subgroups as defined by reciprocal cross neutralization in vitro.',\n",
       " 'Bovine rotavirus strain B223 was shown, by a two-way cross-neutralization assay, to be distinct from any of the 9 established serotypes. In addition, approximately 75% of the VP7 gene has been sequenced and available data are consistent with its designation as a new serotype. ',\n",
       " 'Continued efforts have been made to delineate the genetic mechanisms underlying virulence of rotavirus in the newborn gnotobiotic piglet model. In addition to the three genes encoding rotavirus outercapsid protein VP4 or VP7 or nonstructural protein NS28, a fourth gene (gene number three) encoding a core protein appears to play an important role in determining the virulence of rotavirus in the porcine model. Information obtained from this study may have important implications for the development of effective and safe rotavirus vaccine strategies. ',\n",
       " 'Diarrheal disease is an important cause of morbidity in infants and young children in developed countries and a major cause of morbidty and mortality in the same age group in developing countries. A major goal of this laboratory is the development of a rotavirus vaccine to prevent serious rotavirus disease in infants and young children. Two approaches that have been evaluated in humans: 1) the use of a live attenuated human rotavirus strain and 2) the use of a live rotavirus strain of animal origin. With reference to the first approach, we had observed that the tissue culture adapted mutant of human rotavirus (HRV) serotype 1 (Wa strain) was antigenic and attenuated in adult volunteers. The second approach, employing an animal rotavirus as vaccine has been applied successfully by Vesikari, et al,, using bovine rotavirus NCDV which was shown to be attenuated and to induce resistance to moderate or severe rotavirus diarrhea in infants and young children. We have performed extensive studies with another animal rotavirus, rhesus rotavirus (RRV) strain MMU18006, which was adapted to diploid simian FRhL-2 cells and which shares protective antigens with human rotavirus serotype 3. In addition, rhesus rotavirus (RRV) appears to be restricted in humans because it has not been recovered from persons undergoing rotavirus infection under natural conditions. In volunteer studies that began in adults and progressed stepwise to infants 4 months of age, RRV was found to be quite antigenic. However, transient fever and loose stools were observed in young vaccinees less than 1 year of age who received 1,000,000 pfu of RRV. However, infants 4-11 months old who were fed a 100,000 or 10,000 pfu of RRV in Venezuela did not develop fever or diarrhea. 100,000 pfu of RRV induced rotavirus antibodies in the serum of 82% of vaccinees. Further studies with this vaccine are planned. ',\n",
       " 'Although the electron microscope has been used steadily by our laboratory, its peak activity occurred about two decades ago when it was the vehicle for: (i) the discovery of the first important gastroenteritis virus, the Norwalk virus, followed in succession by the discovery of the Hawaii virus and Montgomery County virus, other agents of viral gastroenteritis; (ii) the discovery of the hepatitis A virus; (iii) the initial detection in the United States of human rotavirus (which was discovered in Australia), the most important cause of severe diarrhea of infants and young children; and (iv) understanding the natural history and importance of rotaviruses in infants and young children. In the past decade it was also instrumental in studies of hepatitis E virus. This past year marked a striking resurgence of activity involving the electron microscope because it proved to be: (i) the only method for detecting recombinant Norwalk, Desert Shield, Hawaii and Toronto virus-like particles that were expressed in insect cells; and (ii) the only method to demonstrate specific antigenic relationships among these recombinants (by immune electron microscopy). As a result, the electron microscope has been an important adjunct to many of the projects of the section providing seminal information in the progress of molecular biologic (as well as other) studies. The scope of the use of the electron microscope is evidenced by the observation that over 100 individual experiments were conducted by electron microscopy since the previous annual report. ',\n",
       " 'A PCR technique employing relatively conserved regions of variant- specific surface antigen(VSP) genes was developed to differentiate Giardia isolates. The regions of the VSPH7 protein responsible for Zn and mental binding was determined by the use of fusion peptides containing various regions of VSPH7. Although the previously defined LIM- RING finger-like region bound Zn, other regions also could bind metals, and this was most likely due to CXXCXnCXXXC motifs scattered throughout the protein. There is conservation of spacing between CXXC motifs in a subset of VSPs. These findings indicate a conservation of structure, but diversity in antigenicity. Prior studies identified a transcript (GLORF- C4) specific for Group 3 Giardia; however, antibodies produced to the fusion protein identified a similar protein in other groups. Therefore, homologous proteins are present in other Giardia groups, and the reason the transcripts are not identified is because the sequences differ. Other proteins have also be identified which differ among Giardia lamblia isolates. ',\n",
       " 'Aggregation of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor (FcepsilonRI), expressed on mast cells and basophils, initiates the immediate hypersensitivity reaction. Aggregated FcepsilonRI has been reported to rapidly migrate to lipid rafts in RBL-2H3 cells. We confirmed that aggregated FcepsilonRI is found in the lipid raft fractions of cellular lysates. Furthermore, we show that the cross-linked FcepsilonRI remains associated with detergent-resistant structures upon internalization. Previous morphological studies have reported that aggregated FcepsilonRI is endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits, which in general are not lipid raft associated. To address this apparent discrepancy, we employed siRNA to suppress expression of components of the clathrin-mediated internalization machinery, namely, clathrin heavy chain, and the AP-2 (alpha-adaptin or mu2-subunit). Transferrin receptor (TfR) is endocytosed by a clathrin-mediated process and, as expected, each transfected siRNA caused a two to threefold elevation of TfR surface expression and almost completely inhibited its endocytosis. In contrast, there was no effect on surface expression levels of FcRI nor on the endocytosis of the dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin (DNP-HSA) IgE FcepsilonRI complex. On the contrary, internalization of DNP-HSA IgE FcepsilonRI was inhibited by overexpression of a dominant-negative dynamin mutant. We conclude that internalization of cross-linked FcepsilonRI does not require the AP-2 clathrin complex but is dynamin-dependent and may be lipid raft mediated.',\n",
       " 'A significant percentage of patients with Crohns disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease, have a mutation in CARD15 (NOD2) an intra-cellular protein that recognizes a breakdown product, muramyl dipeptide (MDP), of a common bacterial component, peptidoglycan (PGN). MDP via CARD15 signaling and its parent molecule, PGN via TLR2 (Toll-like Receptor 2) signaling activate the key intra-cellular inflammation switch, NF-kappaB. Thus, it was possible that the mutation disturbs the coordinate activation of NF-kappaB by these separate signaling pathways. In studies to explore this possibility, it was shown that mice lacking CARD15, manifest greatly increased IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-gamma production by monocytes when stimulated by PGN and that production of these cytokines by normal monocytes stimulated via TLR2 by TLR2 stimulants that do not contain MDP was inhibited by MDP. From this it was evident that MDP normally down-regulates PGN induction of inflammatory cytokines. In subsequent studies of the molecular basis of this down-regulation it was shown that CARD15 signaling leads to inhibition of PGN induction of NF-kappaB activation, particularly the activation of c-Rel, an NF-kappaB component closely associated with the production of IL-12. Finally, in studies to explore whether these mechanisms do indeed explain the effect of CARD15 mutations in Crohns disease: introduction of a CARD15 gene bearing the patient mutation into CARD15-deficient cells did not correct the abnormal IL-12 production of these cells whereas introduction of a normal CARD15 gene did lead to correction. Taken together, these findings reveal a new mechanism by which innate responses to bacterial products are regulated and show that an abnormality of this mechanism can lead to excess IL-12 production and the inflammation of Crohns disease.',\n",
       " \"C. trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen in the US. Chlamydia infections appear to have adverse effects on women's health including complications of pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and cervical infections. The objectives of this project are to define the epidemiology, risk factors, transmission kinetics and pathogenesis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in different population settings and different disease states using new molecular amplification assays. To address this objective, we have continued screening using non-invasive samples with molecular amplification assays for C. trachomatis and documented high rates of infection in sexually active adolescents in diverse cultural settings in six countries. Prevalence rates of chlamydia ranged from 3.9% in rural villages in Zimbabwe and Uganda, 11.1% in St. Petersburg, Russia, 5.5% in Lima, Peru, 8.8% in Fuzhou, China, and 1.2% in Chennai, India. STD clinics in Baltimore routinely run 20% for men, 11.4% for women and as high as 14% for high school students. We have determined that in high school students 25% of infected students get re-infected within one year. The documented high rates of chlamydia in these countries raises serious concerns about the resurgence of STDs that may reflect a rise in high-risk behavior which may subsequently lead to further HIV transmission. In a study of adolescent males in the US, we determined the cost effectiveness of chlamydia screening on admission to detention centers. Chlamydia prevalence in the population was 4.8% and the average number of female sexual partners per infected male was 1.6. We determined that universal screening by nucleic acid amplified test was the most cost-effective strategy preventing 37 more cases of pelvic inflammatory disease and three more cases of epididymitis than selective screening. With the implementation of universal screening we have performed a new study comparing self-administered vaginal swabs, cervical swabs, and first-catch urines for the diagnosis of chlamydial and gonorrhea infections in women from STD clinics in Baltimore. Specimens from 321 women were compared. Results showed that a self-administered vaginal swab detected the most infections; 10.8% prevalence compared to cervical swabs (10.6%) or urine (10.2%) indicating that self-administered vaginal swabs were equivalent or even better than cervical or urine samples for the detection of chlamydia. For gonorrhea, the vaginal swab performed better that cervical or urine samples; vaginal swab 5.0% prevalence, cervical 3.8%, and urine 4.3% prevalence. This study and others we have previously reported demonstrate that vaginal swabs are appropriate specimens for diagnosing chlamydial genital tract infection by amplified diagnostic assays. Non-invasive screening for chlamydia can be applied in different clinical and non-clinical sites thereby increasing the size of the population to be screened. We have additionally developed research realtime PCR assays for other STDs, such as Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and the LGV serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis. We have screened for C. trachomatis infections in a surgical antibiotic treatment study of trachoma in Ethiopia and Tanzania by performing PCR studies as outcome measures of these interventions. In support of world-wide clinical trials for safety and efficacy of vaginal microbicides we have recently tested their potential inhibitory effect in urine samples on the ability of molecular amplification assays to detect Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Some older molecular assays fail to detect these organisms when they are in urine with the microbicides, but for the majority, most amplified assays are not affected by the presence of microbicides in urine samples.\",\n",
       " 'AIDS is a global pandemic with over 20 million HIV-infected individuals worldwide. A major focus within our laboratory has been defining the unique epidemiologic, clinical, virologic and immunologic features of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in developing countries and in the U.S. In Pune, India, we established a prospective cohort of over 3,000 high-risk individuals attending STD clinics, of whom 21% were seropositive for HIV-1. The HIV incidence was 10.2% with rates as high as 28% for commercial sex workers. Recurrent genital ulcers and non-ulcerative STDs were independently associated with a 7 and 3- fold increased risk of HIV seroconversion, respectively. Genetic analysis of viral strains demonstrated clade C2 and C3. A community-based STD mass treatment campaign among 5,000 individuals in Uganda resulted in a 60% reduction in the prevalence and incidence of bacterial STDs. In a multi-center study on perinatal transmission in the U.S., we determined that elevated RNA viral levels at birth were suggestive of in utero infection and that a high plasma RNA viral level in the first two months of life was associated with a rapid progression to AIDS or death. In addition, co- infection of the mother with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) resulted in a 3-fold increase in perinatal transmission of HCV and a 2-fold increase in perinatal transmission of HIV. Short-course intermittent chemotherapy for tuberculosis in 427 patients in Haiti resulted in a 94% efficacy rate in HIV seropositive patients and 97.2% rate in HIV seronegative patients. In studies of HIV-1 and HTLV-1 co-infection in Brazil, we documented a higher incidence of myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy among dually infected individuals. In addition, T and B cell responses to pneumococcal and tetanus immunizations were markedly diminished among dually infected individuals compared to these infected with HIV-1 alone. Median serum HIV RNA levels were similar in both co-infected and singly infected patients, suggesting that the advanced neurologic abnormalities in co-infected patients were unrelated to HIV viral level.

       " \"A crucial element in the development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic strategies for AIDS is an experimental animal model in which the course of immunodeficiency virus infection parallels the pathogenesis of the human disease. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques satisfies this criterion and is therefore a relevant model. Notably, SIV induces an immunodeficiency syndrome in infected macaques that is remarkably similar in pathogenesis to human AIDS. An important use of this animal model system is the detailed study of pathogenesis and viral determinants of disease since many studies of this type are not feasible in humans. Such investigations should allow us to determine how primate lentiviruses destroy the immune system of their hosts, and this understanding should facilitate the development of more rational therapeutic antiviral strategies. The goals of this project include: 1) the molecular characterization of novel SIV's for phylogenetic studies and as reagents for pathogenesis and vaccine studies; and 2) delineation of the pathogenesis of SIV-induced AIDS. \",\n",
       " 'Human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus encodes two envelope-associated glycoproteins, the fusion (F) glycoprotein and the larger (G) glycoprotein. As described previously, the complete amino sequence of the F glycoprotein was deduced by nucleotide sequence analysis of a nearly-complete cDNA of the mRNA. Recently, a complete cDNA of the mRNA encoding the G glycoprotein was isolated and analyzed by DNA sequencing. The predicted mRNA sequence encodes a protein of 298 amino acids, consistent with the estimated molecular weight of the in vitro translation product synthesized in response to hybrid-selected mRNA. Taken together with results from other laboratories, the predicted amino acid sequence shows that the G glycoprotein contains a remarkably high content of N-linked and O-linked carbohydrate and probably is anchored in the membrane by a hydrophobic domain located near the N-terminus.

Over 300 patients with these diseases have been enrolled in research progrmas at the NIH. A study utilizing 500 hospital employees demonstrated the low risk of infectivity with the IAD virus among hospital personnel. Studies of family groups revealed spread of infection only among sexual contacts within those groups. A cell line was developed which, following infection with the AIDS virus, gave rise to a cell line with latent AIDS virus. this latent virus could be induced with a variety of viral promoting agents including radiation and IUDR. Utilizing the technique of in situ hybridization, virus-positive cells were detected in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and semen of patients.

       " 'Antigen-specific T lymphocyte activation occurs through the clonally distributed T cell receptor (TCR), which is involved in thymocyte selection and peripheral T cell effector responses. How TCR-dependent lineage commitment from a common precursor occurs for the two major subsets of T cells, the CD4+ and CD8+ cells, remains unknown. Furthermore, the quantitative and qualitative relationships between receptor occupancy and signaling for differentiation are also poorly understood. This project uses cellular, biochemical, and molecular approaches to study differentiation of thymocytes and activation of T cells upon ligand engagement. Our previous studies suggested that thymocyte development could involve lineage choice and partial maturation that is independent of the MHC class involved in T cell recognition, followed by complete maturation (positive selection) of those cells whose remaining expression of CD4 or CD8 matched the MHC class-specificity of the T cell receptor. Studies of gene targeted and chimeric mice support this conclusion and show that recognition of thymic epithelial MHC per se is critical to the first step in development. Characterization of mature and transitional phenotype cells in invariant chain-deficient mice has also allowed new insights into the quantitative parameters of thymocyte deletion. We previously reported that some TCR ligands evoke only a subset of T cell effector responses, and that such variant ligands can selectively antagonize cytokine production induced by receptor agonists. New studies show that variant ligands induce only a subset of the tyrosine phosphorylation events typically accompanying agonist recognition. These variant signal transduction events indirectly affect biological responses such an anergy, and can arise not only from changes in the TCR ligand, but also alterations in the signaling machinery of the T cell. Along with our work on the molecular organization of T cell signal transduction complexes (Z01 AI 00349-12 LI), this helps explain how protein-protein interactions result in antigen receptor-dependent second messenger generation, and how specific intracellular signals contribute to the downstream gene activation events in T cells that control effector function and tolerance induction.

       " 'Despite numerous advances during the past decade, our understanding of how HIV-1 causes immunodeficiency is largely incomplete. Investigations of HIV-1 pathogenesis have also been hampered by a lack of a tractable animal model: with the exception of a recent report, HIV-1 inoculations of chimpanzees do not result in immunodeficiency. Because SIV, the close primate lentivirus relative of HIV-1, does induce an AIDS-like disease in Asian macaques and possesses a genomic organization similar to that of HIV-1, investigators have constructed SIV HIV chimeric viruses (SHIVs) to address pathogenicity and vaccine issues related to the incorporated HIV-1 gene sequences. During the past year we have constructed a pathogenic SHIV and evaluated viral and cellular factors contributing to disease development. These include: 1) the use of virus derived directly from molecular clones rather than from serial animal-to-animal passage; 2) the screening of gene segments derived from HIV-1 isolates exhibiting T-cell line, macrophage, or dual tropic properties; 3) the testing of immunodeficiency-inducing properties of wild type and mutagenized HIV-1 and SIV nef genes; 4) the inoculation of three different macaque species; and 5) the size and properties of the challenge virus stock. CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are critical for the resolution of many viral infections. Although it has been inferred that the CTL response mediates the resolution of the primary HIV-1 infection, direct proof that CD8+ T lymphocytes are responsible for the decline of viremia during acute lentivirus infections and or the control of virus spread cell killing during chronic infection has not yet been obtained. To directly evaluate the role of CD8+ T lymphocytes during primary infection, a CD8 monoclonal antibody was parenterally administered to specifically deplete this lymphocyte subset prior to or during acute infections of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with a SIV HIV (SHIV) chimeric virus. Animals receiving the anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody, developed a transient depletion of CD8 positive cells in both the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. When administered during primary SIV HIV chimeric virus (SHIV) infections, the CD8 mAb caused marked elevations of plasma and cell-associated virus levels in both the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues, and led to prolonged depletion of CD4 cells. Taken together, these results directly demonstrate that CD8+ T lymphocytes are actively involved in controlling the acute phase of primate lentivirus infections. ',\n",

       " '1) Primary infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox, and reactivation of the virus from latency results in zoster. The goals of this project are to identify and determine the function of VZV genes that are expressed during active infection and during latency in the body. 2) VZV genes that are expressed during active infection and regulate viral gene expression in vitro are being studied. Analysis of VZV gene products during acute infection indicate that five VZV genes, ORF4, ORF10, ORF61, ORF62, and ORF63, regulate the expression of other VZV genes in vitro. Two cellular proteins (Oct1, HCF) have been shown to interact with a VZV protein (ORF10) to activate the ORF62 gene. These cellular proteins have been shown to bind to a specific sequence on the VZV ORF62 promoter. A different cellular protein (USF) has been found to interact with another VZV protein (ORF62) to activate expression of two VZV genes (ORF28, ORF29). The USF protein binds to a specific sequence located between the ORF 28 and 29 genes. 3) Critical domains required for the activity of two VZV genes (VZV ORF4 and ORF61) have been identified. A domain near the amino terminus of ORF4 is required to activate expression of other VZV genes. This domain can functionally substitute for its corresponding homolog in a herpes simplex virus protein. A domain in ORF61 is found in the RING finger family of proteins and is required for functional activity of ORF61 protein. The transcription activation domain of ORF10 has been identified at the amino terminus of the protein. This activation domain has been found to share structural features with its herpes simplex virus VP16 homolog. 4) Central nervous system tissues obtained from individuals who have recovered from chicken pox infection in the distant past are being studied to determine which VZV genes are expressed while the virus in dormant in the human body. Analysis of trigeminal ganglia from human cadavers without active evidence of VZV infection indicates that two VZV genes, ORF29 and ORF62, are expressed during latency in non-neuronal (satellite) cells, while other viral genes (ORF10, ORF61) are not expressed.

       " 'For several years, we have been studying in molecular detail the primary genetic response of human peripheral blood T cells to mitogenic activation. By employing subtractive cloning technology, we have previously isolated in excess of 60 genes whose expression is induced within hours of cellular stimulation. Included among these genes are well-known lymphokines, receptors and oncogenes in addition to many novel genes whose functions we are investigating. To date we have discovered a number of genes important for proliferation and the expression of a differentiated T cell phenotype; these include two novel lymphokines, three zinc finger proteins, factors which bind DNA, a steroid receptor protein, a novel phosphatase, a ras oncogene-related protein, a transmembrane receptor closely related to a receptor involved in signalling during cell killing by natural killer cells and two genes which belong to a new family of NF-KasppaB transcription factors. We have pursued both functional as well as regulatory aspects of several selected novel genes. One of the zinc finger genes, 225, is deregulated in its expression by transformation with the human T leukemia virus, suggesting a potential function of this protein in cellular transformation. Drosophila genes sharing a similar zinc finger domain have been cloned to understand function in a genetically more easily manageable system. NF-KappaB complexes regulate expression of many inducible genes including most lymphokines cytokines as well as many viruses like human immunodeficiency virus and cytomegalovirus. We have demonstrated that these many pleiotropic effects are likely to be mediated by several distinct factors including one made up of relB and rik two novel mitogen inducible rel-related proteins distinct from any previously described constituents of NF-KappaB. These two factors heterodimerize and bind to KappaB sites and transactivate such sites in cells in vivo. ',\n",
       " 'I) To further elucidate B cell isotype differentiation in humans we defined the conditions necessary for IgG sub-class-specific germline transcript (GLT) production in human peripheral blood cells. We found that induction of GLT for the various IgG subclasses fell into two patterns. Induction of Cgamma3 and Cgamma1, GLT, transcripts of genes in the first human duplication unit, generally required a proliferative stimulus (SAC) and was brought about by SAC plus IL-4 (Cgamma3 GLT) and SAC alone or SAC plus IL-2 (Cgamma1 GLT); in contrast, induction of Cgamma2 and Cgamma4 GLT, transcripts of genes in the second duplication unit, was induced accomplished with cytokines alone: IFN-gamma (Cgamma2 GLT) and IL-4 (Cgamma4 GLT), and was not augmented by addition of a proliferative stimulus. Finally, we found that IFN-gamma inhibited IL-4- induced Cgamma3 and Cgamma4 GLT (with or without SAC). These findings establish that the various human IgG subclasses manifest distinct requirements for the regulation of early steps in isotype differentiation. In addition, they suggest that human Cgamma genes exhibit patterns of regulation related to their respective gene duplication units. II) IL-10 has recently been shown to have an important influence on human B cell differentiation. To learn about the regulation of this cytokine we tested the hypothesis that its production by monocytes is under control of one of the inflammatory cytokines. In initial studies, we co-cultured purified human peripheral blood monocytes with a panel of cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL1-beta, IL-6, GM-CSF, TGF- beta and IFN-alpha, and then measured IL-10 mRNA production using a semi- quantitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. We found that TNF-alpha has a major effect on IL-10 mRNA production, inducing an 80-120-fold increase over baseline; in contrast, none of the other cytokines have more than a 2-3-fold effect. In later studies, we showed that the induction of IL-10 mRNA by TNF-alpha is dose- dependent and begins between 8-24 hr following the addition of TNF-alpha; this suggests that the increased IL-10 mRNA level is due to de nova mRNA synthesis rather than mRNA stabilization. Taken together, these results suggest that TNF-alpha plays a key role in the induction of IL-10 in human monocytes; as such, it induces a molecule that provides negative feedback to its sown production. In addition, these studies suggest that TNF-alpha, via its effect on IL-10, may affect overall levels of B cell proliferation. ',\n",

Increased diagnostic sensitivity and specificity have been achieved by using PCR-based amplification of parasite DNA is skin snips from patients with onchocerciasis and blood specimens from patients with bancroftian filariasis. Therapeutic trials of ivermectin in bancroftian filariasis have indicated its superiority to diethylcarbamazine as a microfilaricide, and further studies are underway to compare its macrofilaricidal and synergistic activities with DEC. Trials of albendazole in loiasis indicate that this drug appears to be an effective macrofilaricidal and synergistic activities with DEC.

       " \"Herpes simplex virus is a useful model for studying the mechanisms involved in DNA cells. Our current efforts are directed toward studying this process with purified proteins. Seven viral genes are both necessary and sufficient to carry out authentic origin-dependent DNA replication. Ongoing biochemical analyses in several laboratories support the idea that the products of these seven genes all participate directly in viral DNA synthesis. We are currently using both biochemical and molecular genetic approaches to understand the function of these polypeptides in detail. The HSV DNA polymerase purified from infected HeLa cells consists of a stable complex of at least two polypeptides: UL30, the catalytic subunit, and UL42. We have purified both subunits free of each other using recombinant baculoviruses. Although the purified catalytic subunit has the same specific activity as the UL30 UL42 complex using activated DNA as template, the complex is much more active on a long single-stranded DNA template primed with a short oligonucleotide. Several lines of evidence support the view UL42 increases the efficiency of the DNA polymerase by increasing its processivity. The UL9 protein binds specifically to the HSV origins of replication. Determination of the hydrodynamic properties of purified UL9 protein has shown that the protein interacts with itself to form a dimer in solution, and possibly higher order structures when bound to the origin of replication. Current experiments on UL9 are aimed at characterizing these higher order structures in more detail. In addition to origin binding, the purified UL9 protein an intrinsic 3' to 5' helicase activity that is capable of unwinding short duplex DNA segments in an ATP-dependent reaction. The role of this unwinding reaction in DNA replication is being investigated. The UL5, UL8, and UL52 polypeptides form a three protein complex that has both helicase and primase activities. Data from several labs suggest that UL8 has primase activity, and UL5 and UL52 act together as a helicase. We are currently carrying out directed mutagenesis of these proteins to gain further insight into their activities. \",\n",
       " 'Mice infected with a mixture of retroviruses, termed LP-BM5 murine leukemia viruses (MuLV), develop an immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferative syndrome with many similarities to human AIDS. We have investigated cellular interactions that contribute to the development of these abnormalities. One of the central features of this disease is dysfunction of CD4+ T cells. It was shown that in vivo, development of phenotypic and functional abnormalities of this T cell subset is dependent on the presence of mature B cells. In vitro analyses of this phenomenon suggested that several mechanisms may contribute to induction of this abnormality. First, normal CD4+ T cells providing help for self + X cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses were found to be actively inhibited by cells from infected mice, suggesting induction of suppressor cells following infection. Second, antigen specific T cell clones were shown to proliferate poorly in response to antigen presented by spleen cells from infected mice suggesting impaired function of antigen presenting cells (APC). Finally, we demonstrated that CD4+ T cells primed in vivo to soluble antigens were impaired in their ability to generate secondary in vitro proliferative responses, suggesting an acquired intrinsic defect of CD4+ cells. In other studies, we have found that an active anti-viral CTL response can be generated in mice susceptible to the disease. ',\n",

In each of these areas we seek research advances that can improve the knowledge of disease processes in malaria and thereby support the development of new antimalarial chemotherapies, diagnostic tools, and vaccines.

       " 'In order to understand the development of the thymus, both in terms of T cell differentiation and the stromal cell environment, we have undertaken a molecular approach to identify the genes expressed in this tissue. Our strategy is to make two cDNA libraries: one from total thymus of 129 mice, the other from BALB c mice expressing the SCID mutation. The latter has a developmental arrest at the IL-2 receptor alpha high double negative stage of T cell development; thus, the cDNA library from this mouse will be enriched for genes expressed in early T cell precursors and the stromal cells. We are currently developing several methods to screen these libraries, including subtractive hybridization, massive cDNA sequencing, probing with PCR-based libraries generated from rigorously defined T cell subsets, and differential display. At this early stage of the project, we have prepared the two cDNA libraries from total and SCID thymus. Although we have only just begun some preliminary sequencing, we have already identified the mouse ARF-3 protein (a small GTP binding protein involved in vesicular transport) and a new beta3 integrin (involved in cell adhesion), as well as a third gene with no known homology to anything in the GenBank data base.

       " 'A major focus in our studies of T cell differentiation is to identify the developmental signals that control cell fate decisions. In this regard, our most significant findings in this reporting period relates to how developing T cells decide to become alpha-beta or gamma-delta T cells and for those T cells that choose the alpha-beta T cell lineage, the mechanism underlying CD4 or CD8 lineage commitment. Others have proposed that it is the successful rearrangement of the alpha-beta or gamma-delta TCR genes that determine the alpha-beta or gamma-delta lineage choice. Our data suggest, however, that early rearrangement and expression of either TCR (alpha-beta or gamma-delta ) will allow gamma-delta lineage commitment. This result indicates that the lineage choice is not dictated by the class of TCR expressed. Moreover, some cells with productive rearrangement and expression of TCRgamma-delta do choose the alpha-beta pathway and upon successful rearrangement and expression of TCRbeta have a mechanism to silence gamma-delta TCR expression. Our more recent studies indicate that additional signals through the transmembrane receptor Notch, also influence this lineage choice. If and how TCR and Notch signals might be processed integrated is currently under investigation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that while TCR gene rearrangement and expression is a necessary requirement for development it is not sufficient for alpha-beta gamma-delta lineage committment. Also implied from these studies is that while the TCRalpha gene rearrangement process is terminated as a result of MHC engagement (which is also a requirement for maturation positive selection of alpha-beta T cells), gamma-delta T cells have no requirement for MHC signals and MHC has no effect on gamma delta rearrangement in gamma-delta committed cells. Our experiments indicate that it is the simple expression of a good TCR that terminates the TCR gene rearrangement process in this lineage. Defining factors that influence the CD4 CD8 lineage decision could be an important step toward resolving the underlying mechanism. Coreceptors are obvious candidates, but because they are usually required for MHC recognition it has been difficult to independently assess their role in lineage choice. Our findings demonstrate that at least some thymocytes with MHC class II specific TCR are CD4 independent in their recognition of class II and enabled us to separately examine the role of the coreceptor in lineage commitment. T cells with these TCRs develop in the CD4 pathway when CD4 is present but in the CD8 pathway when CD4 is absent. Thus, even for a TCR that is coreceptor independent, the coreceptor can influence the lineage choice. From these results we have proposed a new instructional model in which lineage choice is determined by the intensity of signals delivered to CD4 and CD8 thymocytes through the TCR complex. There are no distinct signals but rather it is the net quantity of TCR signals that direct the lineage choice. We are currently testing whether signals of strong intensity promote the CD4 fate, whereas weaker signals promote a CD8 fate. ',\n",
       " 'Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, appears during periods of growth to shed membranous material from its surface. Using an antigen capture detection method developed in the laboratory, this material could be demonstrated on the surface of spirochetes, free in culture medium and in infected animals and ticks. Although the captured antigens were initially assayed by immune electron microscopy, other methods have been used recently to characterize the nature of these bioproducts and to assess their possible role in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. Researchers in the laboratory have been able to demonstrate that extracellular components of B. burgdorferi 1) appear to be present wherever active growth of the organism is taking place and therefore, may be useful as a diagnostic indicator of active infection and or treatment effectiveness; 2) are involved in the packaging and protection of intact DNA molecules containing a few known and many unknown genes and gene products; 3) appear to specifically interact with immunoglobulin M molecules in a unique fashion, perhaps to escape immune surveillance; and 4) possesses potent, non-specific mitogenic activity which may cause an inappropriate and noneffective stimulation of the immune system triggering autoimmune disease components. Researchers continue to examine these and other bioproducts with the aim of improving the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of Lyme disease. ',\n",
       " 'Field Project in Western Montana During the summers of 2002 and 2004, nine people contracted tick-borne relapsing fever on Wild Horse Island in southwest Flathead Lake, Lake County, Montana (Schwan et al, 2003, Emerg. Infect. Dis; Schwan et al., 2007; Emerg. Infect. Dis). These patients were the first confirmed cases of relapsing fever in the state. Investigations by our group associated with these outbreaks resulted in the first isolations of Borrelia hermsii and the first collection of its tick vector, Ornithodoros hermsi, in Montana. Tick-borne relapsing fever caused by B. hermsii is a zoonosis, and in other parts of western North America, small rodents such as tree squirrels and chipmunks are the primary enzootic vertebrate hosts for the spirochete and ticks in nature. Most people become infected with B. hermsii while sleeping in tick- and rodent-infested cabins, as happened on Wild Horse Island. The ticks are nocturnal and feed quickly in 15 to 60 minutes, so most people are unaware of having been bitten. The prevalence and distribution of B. hermsii in western Montana are unknown. The purpose of this project is to begin to investigate the presence of B. hermsii in small mammal populations at two locations on Flathead Lake; Wild Horse Island, where the patients were infected; and the Flathead Biological Research Station, owned and run by the University of Montana, at Yellow Bay on the eastern shore of the lake. Information gained regarding the presence of B. hermsii in small mammals and ticks will help elucidate the ecological factors maintaining the spirochete, which could help develop future control strategies in specific locations. The Schwan lab has worked for 22 years to determine the distribution and genetic diversity of the relapsing fever spirochete, B. hermsii, found at higher elevation coniferous forests throughout western North America. With the emergence of human relapsing fever cases in western Montana, we have the opportunity to explore the role of local vertebrate hosts at maintaining the spirochete in nature. By establishing additional isolates of the spirochete, we can also determine the genetic diversity and host associations at specific locations. For example, on Wild Horse Island we found two diverse genomic groups of B. hermsii infecting two individuals that slept in the same bed (Schwan et al., 2007; Emerg. Infect. Dis). Thus, additional work in the field will complement laboratory investigations examining the possible maintenance of diverse genetic types of spirochetes in vertebrates and ticks. The goals of this project are to obtain preliminary data on the prevalence and distribution of B. hermsii in animals on Wild Horse Island and the mainland at Yellow Bay. The specific aims are: determine infection and previous exposure of mammalian hosts to B. hermsii; determine the prevalence of B. hermsii in ticks and determine the genomic group to which the spirochetes belong. For this project, most activities of this last year were spent applying for and getting permission to perform the fieldwork. We now have permits from the US. Forest Service; Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks; the Salish-Kootenai Confederated Tribes; and the Animal Care and Use Committees at RML and the University of Montana. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks has provided boat transportation to and from Wild Horse Island, and the DIR funded the purchase of a field vehicle for ground transportation. During July August 2008, live traps were used to capture small mammals. These animals were marked individually with PIT tags, blood was collected for multiple tests, ectoparasites collected, and the animals were released at the site of capture. Over 150 animals have been sampled, and while many species of mammals have been captured, the majority have been deer mice and pine squirrels. Preliminary analysis of blood smears has detected Borrelia hermsii in 7 squirrels and one deer mouse, the latter of which was trapped immediately under a cabin where one patient was infected. Spirochetes were also detected in two squirrels on the mainland at Yellow Bay. Attempts to isolate these spirochetes and the serological testing of the serum samples are currently underway. Fieldwork will end in September and the results obtained in the laboratory this fall will help us plan next years field season that will begin in May 2009. Field Project in Mali, West Africa Throughout most other areas of sub-Saharan Africa, the assumption is that if a patient has an acute febrile, recurring disease, the patient has, and is treated for, malaria. This would explain many treatment failures if the patients had relapsing fever, as the drugs used to treat malaria are ineffective against relapsing fever spirochetes. Malaria is highly prevalent and a serious human infection in Mali, where NIAID has ongoing projects on malaria and leishmaniasis, both vector-borne infections. Little is known about tick-borne relapsing fever in Mali, but given its prevalence in nearby Senegal, and two observations regarding spirochetes in patients in western Mali (Rodhain et al., 1991, Bull. Soc. Path. Ex. 84:30-45), we believe relapsing fever may be significantly misdiagnosed as malaria, as we found recently in Togo (Nordstraand, et al. Tickborne relapsing fever diagnosis obscured by malaria, Togo. Emerging Infect. Dis. 13: 117-123, 2007). The goal of this project is to evaluate the potential for human tick-borne relapsing fever in Mali. Our efforts will be directed at capturing small mammals and testing their blood for spirochetes and antibodies specific for relapsing fever infections; collecting ticks and testing them for spirochete infection; and testing human serum samples already collected for other studies to detect the presence of relapsing fever antibodies. Tick-borne relapsing fever caused by B. crocidurae in West Africa is also a zoonosis, and in Senegal small rodents and shrews are the primary enzootic vertebrate hosts for the spirochete and ticks in nature. Most people become infected with B. crocidurae while sleeping in tick- and rodent-infested huts, as described for a longitudinal study in Senegal published recently (Vial et al., 2006, Incidence of tick-borne relapsing fever in West Africa; longitudinal study, Lancet 368:37-43). The soft tick vector, Ornithodoros sonrai, is nocturnal and feeds quickly in 15 to 60 minutes, so most people are unaware of having been bitten (quite similar to the situation in western North America). The prevalence and distribution of B. crocidurae and its vector in Mali are unknown. However two studies suggest that B. crocidurae may be present in western Mali near the Senegal-Mali border. The purpose of this project is to begin to investigate the presence of B. crocidurae in small mammal populations at various locations in Mali, working out of the NIAID-supported laboratory in Bamako, the capital of Mali. Attempts will also be made to collect ticks from rodent burrows. Information gained regarding the presence of B. crocidurae in small mammals and ticks will help elucidate the potential for human infections, which could be misdiagnosed and treated inappropriately as malaria. Effect of In vitro passage on relapsing fever spirochetes Previous studies have shown the loss of infectivity of B. burgdorferi associated with in vitro cultivation. The effects of long term in vitro cultivation on B. hermsii have not been investigated. All seven isolates of B. hermsii and the one isolate of B. turicatae examined retained infectivity in mice after one year of continuous in vitro cultivation. Furthermore, there were few apparent differences in the plasmid profiles after long-term cultivation. Therefore, these results suggest that relapsing fever spirochetes are genetically stable during in vitro cultivation.',\n",
       " 'Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is potent lymphokine that regulates a wide variety of functions of lymphoid and other hematopoietic cells. An assay to measure IL-4 production by single cells indicates has been developed. It shows that the frequency of T cells capable of producing Il-4 in lymph node cell suspensions from normal mice very low, about 1 1000, is found mainly among large T cells and is completely dependent upon the presence of interleukin- 2 (IL-2). Lymph node T cells from mice that had been injected with antiIgD or infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, treatments known to cause an IL-4-dependent increase in serum IgE, show a frequency of IL-4 producing cells five to ten times as great as T cells from naive donors. Although small resting T cells from naive donors have a frequency of IL-4 producing of about 1 2000, they can be \"primed\" in vitro to develop into IL-4 producing cells by culture with anti-CD3, IL-2 and IL-4; this increases the frequency of IL-4 producing cells to about 1 20. Both IL-2 and IL-4 are required for this in vitro priming method and interferon gamma fails to inhibit such priming. IL-4 is also made by long term mast cell lines in response to receptor cross-linkage, as are other members of the IL-4 family of lymphokines, notably IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF. Among normal spleen and bone marrow cells, a small population of cells have high affinity receptor for IgE. These Fcepsilon receptor positive cells have essentially all the IL-4 producing activity of spleen cells in response to high affinity IgE receptor cross- linkage; frequencies of IL-4 producing cells as high as 1 5 have been achieved. Many of these cells are Alcian Blue positive suggesting that they are either mast cells or basophils. Cells capable of forming mast cell colonies in methylcellulose have a frequency of about 1 10 in this cell population. On a per cell basis, the Fcepsilon receptor positive splenic cells appears to make more than 100-fold more IL-4 per cell than do cells from IL-3-dependent mast cell lines, suggesting that they may be important cells in the mediation of IL-4 dependent events in vivo.

       " 'Although there is strong evidence that control and resolution of human leishmanial infections depends primarily on T cell derived lymphokine mediated activation of parasite infected macrophages, less is known about the nature of the responding cell type(s) which are protective or the Ag(s) that elicit these cells to respond. Studies using whole soluble Ag (\"dead Ag\") preparations show that patients respond to a wide range of leishmanial Ag. The objective of recent studies has been to characterise the response of T cells from patients with healing or healed cutaneous or mucosal infections to Ag expressed by or derived from actively infected autologous monocytes (\"live Ag\"). Unfractionated T cells proliferated and produced IFN-gamma in response to both \"live\" and \"dead\" Ag. Depletion of CD4+ T cells resulted in the loss of proliferative and IFN-gamma responses to both \"live\" and \"dead\" Ag. The effect of CD8 depletion, was variable, and not limited to the cells stimulated by infected monocytes. Expansion of T cells specific for \"live\" antigens using amastigote infected cells followed by re-stimulation with HPLC fractionated soluble antigens revealed that a diversity of antigens are associated with infected monocytes. There may, however, be quantitative differences in the expression of certain antigens since \"live\" versus \"dead\" antigens could distinguish responses between MCL and LCL patients. The immune responses in patients with non-healing, visceral forms of disease have continued to be a focus of study. The critical immunological feature of visceral leishmaniasis is the complete absence of cell mediated immunity to leishmanial antigens. Patients have been shown to have negative intradermal skin tests to leishmania, absent lymphocyte blastogenesis, and decreased IL-2 and IFN-g production in response to parasite antigens. Despite this unresponsiveness, there is evidence that antigen-specific T cells are present in kala-azar patients. Visceral leishmaniasis is accompanied by high titres of antileishmanial antibodies, most of which are likely to be T-cell dependent. Additionally, T-cells are required are likely to be required for successful chemotherapy of visceral disease. Mouse models of cytokine-mediated lymphocyte functional regulation provide a theoretical framework for the present investigation of the antigen-specific anergy of kala-azar. For a descriptive study of cytokine patterns in kala-azar, we sought to maximize assay sensitivity by using semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR techniques to analyze cytokine mRNA extracted from lesional tissue -- bone marrow. In preliminary data we provide evidence that IL-10 mRNA is present at relatively high levels in active kala-azar, being at or below the limits of detectability after treatment, and absent in uninfected controls.

       " 'Analysis of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) mRNAs by cDNA cloning, sequencing and related techniques has identified ten different mRNAs, and to date a single encoded polypeptide has been identified for each. We are interested in (i) continuing the analysis of the viral mRNAs and their translational open reading frames (ORFs) to detect possible additional mRNAs and polypeptides and to learn more about the details of RSV gene expression, (ii defining the extent of sequence diversity among RSV isolates, and (iii) analyzing the individual RSV proteins to determine their intracellular and virion locations and their functions. We have continued the analysis of the 1A protein (whose name has been changed to SH [small hydrophobic] to be consistent with the nomenclature for simian virus 5 and mumps virus). The SH protein was shown to be an integral membrane protein that is processed by a complex intracellular pathway that results in two nonglycosylated and two glycosylated species. The processing pathway and structural differences between the different forms have been shown to be conserved between the two RSV antigenic subgroups. Experiments are continuing to determine the membrane orientation, site of glycosylation, and the oligomeric status of the different forms of the SH protein. In other work, a complete nucleotide sequence was determined for the 22K gene of strain 18537. Comparison with the previously-determined strain A2 sequence revealed a high level (92%) of amino acid conservation for the 22K (M2) protein and identified a second, conserved ORF whose protein product remains to be identified. The high level of conservation of the 22K protein is of significance because it has been shown to be the major target antigen for RSV-specific cytotoxic T cells from infected mice (accompanying report).

       " 'In the study of the human filariases, progress has been hampered by 1) the lack of defined parasite antigens; 2) the broad immunological cross- reactivity seen among the eight filarial species of humans; and 3) the dearth of abundant parasite material. The objectives of this project are to define and generate filarial proteins that are important in inducing parasite-specific immune responses in the human host and to understand, at a molecular level, the differences among related filarial species. cDNA and genomic libraries have been either constructed (Brugia malayi, Loa and Wuchereria bancrofti, Onchocerca volvulus) or made available (Onchocerca volvulus, Brugia malayi larval cDNA library) so that screening with defined patient sera, patient T cells or parasite DNA could be performed. Recombinant antigens and probes have been identified that a) induce T cell responses in an antigen-specific manner, b) may be in part protective in onchocerciasis; c) can distinguish among related filarial species by restriction fragment length polymorphisms, PCR or direct Southern blotting; d) encode immunoreactive and potentially protective molecules of W. bancrofti; e) identify repeated segments of either the W. bancrofti genome or that of Loa; and f) may be of potential diagnostic importance.

       " \"Both human basophils and mast cells arise from CD34+ progenitor cells. Messenger RNA's for the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of the high affinity IgE receptor are coordinately expressed during the first few days of culture of murine bone marrow coincident with the appearance of mononuclear cells bearing high affinity IgE receptors. IgE receptor positive cells purified by FACS have been demonstrated to develop into mature mast cells. Mast cells adhere to surfaces coated with laminin. This process is enhanced by IgE-mediated activation but may occur in the absence of histamine release. Mast cell attachment to laminin depends upon a five amino acid (IKVAV) sequence. When mast cells attach to laminin, they decrease c-myc, but increase c-fos expression; and the levels of nuclear factors for c-AMP responsive elements increase. Murine mast cells also adhere to fibronectin, a process which is also dependent upon mast cell activation. Adhesion is inhibited by the RGDS peptide. A 120 kD fragment of fibronectin containing an attachment region mimics the activity of the native molecule. IL-3 dependent murine mast cell lines have been established by infecting bone marrow mast cells using AD12-SV50 hybrid virus. Cell lines established are similar to mast cells grown in primary culture from bone marrow. Mast cells synthesize heparan sulfate, collagen IV, and laminin which are the principle components of basement membrane. FCERI crosslinking in primary mast cell cultures results in the induction of multiple cytokine genes; significant levels of RNA for TGF-beta can be found in resting mast cells; cytokine genes can be divided into two groups (pro-inflammatory and growth factors) based on the intensity of the RNA signal and the time course of expression; and the expression of these groups appears to be regulated by distinct mechanisms. Dexamethasone added to cultured mast cells inhibits RNA synthesis. \",\n",
       " \"Accumulation of neutrophils to sites of infection and inflammation is essential to host defense. When too few neutrophils accumulate there is increased susceptibility to infection. When too many neutrophils accumulate there can be tissue destruction. In recent years cytokines, products of numerous types of cells, have been shown to attract neutrophils to inflammation. One of these cytokines, IL-8 is critical for mobilizing normal numbers of neutrophils to inflammatory sites. This past year our investigations of the synthesis of IL-8, a potent chemoattractant, by neutrophils were continued. Previously we demonstrated that when human blood neutrophil s migrate into tissues they are induced to make abundant amounts of IL-8.

Killing of normal healthy cells is prevented by inhibitory receptors on NK cells that recognize surface molecules called major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I). A major goal of this project is to define the molecular basis of MHC class I recognition by the inhibitory receptors on NK cells. Another important question is how recognition of MHC class I by the receptor results in a negative signal transmitted to the NK cell. Although NK cells serve useful functions in immune responses against certain viruses and parasites, they are dangerous, as they exhibit potent killing activity. Therefore, the mechanisms in place to prevent killing of normal cells by NK cells serve an essential function. It is important to understand how such regulation of NK activity is achieved. Finally, the regulation of NK cell activity by inhibitory receptors serves as a model to study other receptor systems that may use a similar mode of negative regulation. The experiments carried out under this project have defined a region of the receptor that controls recognition of MHC class I, and how the structure of MHC class I molecules may impact on this specific recognition. Some of the early steps in the biochemical pathway of NK cell inhibition have been elucidated. Finally, it was discovered that different inhibitory receptors can block NK activation and that they use distinct signaling pathways to achieve inhibition. ',\n",
       " 'Heterogeneity among AIDS retroviral genomes is a distinct feature of lentiviruses, Molecular cloning, restriction enzyme analysis, nucleotide sequencing, and polymerase chain reaction techniques were used to characterize isolates of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). The objective was to obtain information pertaining to the structure and diversity of HIV with respect to its biochemical, pathogenic, and antigenic variability. Most HIV isolates we have cloned are T-cell tropic. We have succeeded in obtaining a complete molecular clone from a macrophagetropic viral isolate. Although T-cells are the major target for HIV replication in peripheral blood, macrophages represent the predominant HIV-infected cell type in most tissues. Macrophages are probably the primary reservoir of HIV, and sustain a persistent infection in individuals for many years. A single HIV macrophagetropic isolate was molecularly cloned, and upon transfection into HeLa cells followed by cocultivation on PBLs or macrophages, produced viral particles (RT). The virus produced was infectious and could replicate in either PBLs or macrophages. It was unable to replicate in a continuous T-cell line (CEM). Growth studies and biochemical analysis with this isolate are in progress. ',\n",
       " 'A major focus of my laboratory is the structure-function correlation of chemokine receptors and mechanisms of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Chemokine receptors are members of the GPCR superfamily and share a common three-dimensional structure composed of seven trans-membrane (TM) domains. Some members of the human chemokine receptor family serve as co-receptors for HIV entry besides their essential roles in regulating leukocyte chemotaxis in inflammation. M-tropic and T-tropic viruses preferentially use CCR5 (R5 strain) and CXCR4 (X4 strain) respectively. Naturally occurring mutations in the co-receptors and their ligands influence HIV transmission and AIDS progression. Analogous to other GPCRs, ligand binding to the chemokine receptors induces conformational change that recruits G-alpha subunit of trimeric G protein followed by GTP hydrolysis. This activation sets up a cascade of events leading to polarized cellular motility and other cellular activation pathways. However, many chemokine receptors differ from this general paradigm in a cell and receptor specific manner. In recent years: 1) We determined the structural requirements of CC and CXC chemokine receptors for the biological function and HIV usage; 2) investigated the effects of naturally occurring CCR5 mutants on the function of wt receptor and its use by HIV; and 3) addressed the mechanistic differences between the CC and CXC chemokine receptors in signaling, desensitization and internalization. In particular, we showed that CCR5 resides mostly in plasma membrane rafts and that trafficking of agonist-bound CCR5 follows a predominantly non-clathrin itinerary that may be facilitated by caveolin expression. In the past year, we have evaluated the significance of agonist driven endocytosis to cell motility and other leukocyte functions and the role(s) of plasma membrane lipid rafts in these processes. We show that in primary human leukocytes, the threshold agonist levels for endocytosis of the chemotactic receptors CCR2B, CXCR1, CXCR2 and CXCR4 are much higher than those needed for maximal chemotactic response. Moreover, CXCR1, CXCR2 and CXCR4 in neutrophils, CCR2B in monocytes and CXCR4 in PBLs could be reactivated in response to repeated application of increasing dose of the same agonist up to a threshold. Thus leukocyte migration in response to chemokines does not appear to be dependent on endocytosis of receptors. Rather than being integral to the process of cell migration, receptor endocytosis may be a terminal stop signal when cells reach the focus of inflammation where the chemoattractant concentrations are the highest. Most of the chemokine receptors are excluded from Triton X-100 insoluble lipid rafts in primary leukocytes, and at high agonist concentrations are rapidly endocytosed by a clathrin rab5 dynamin-dependent pathway. But, the chemotactic response mediated by these receptors is critically dependent on lipid raft integrity, which is required for amplification of PI3K mediated signaling events at the leading edge of polarized leukocytes. In contrast, late signaling events such as degranulation, src and MAP kinase activation that are linked to arrestin recruitment during receptor endocytosis do not require raft integrity irrespective of the lipid microdomain distribution of the signaling receptors. Thus, chemotactic signaling is a rapid and reversible local response to low agonist inputs that is spatially constrained by polarized raft assemblies and asymmetric recruitment of secondary messengers, while the late signaling events resulting from global activation at high agonist inputs are linked to receptor endocytosis, which may or may not be raft-associated. The cytoplasmic domains of plasma membrane receptors contain sequence determinants that regulate orderly protein sorting during anterograde transport, specify organelle targeting and determine the intracellular fate of internalized receptors after agonist binding or cell activation. Animal viruses have evolved several strategies to subvert mechanisms of protein sorting, resulting in aberrant trafficking, intracellular trapping and degradation of targeted receptors. Among viral modulators of receptor expression and trafficking, the 27-32 kDal myristoylated Nef proteins of HIV and SIV have been most extensively characterized for their ability to downregulate CD4 and HLA-I receptors. Genetic and biochemical studies have outlined two different mechanisms for intra-cellular trapping of CD4 and HLA-I induced by Nef. It has been presumed that Nef proteins accelerate endocytosis of CD4 by linking the receptor to the AP-2 clathrin adaptor. However, we showed previously that [DE]XXXL[LI]-type peptide signals from HIV Nef interacted in a bipartite manner with combinations of gamma-sigma1 of AP-1 and delta-sigma3 subunit heterodimers of the AP-1 and AP-3 vesicles respectively. We have extended the above studies to show that the loss of CD4 at the cell surface in HIV-1 Nef expressing cells did not result exclusively from accelerated endocytosis of CD4. However, both the recycling CD4 and the nascent receptor in transit to the plasma membrane were susceptible to intra-cellular retention and degradation in HIV-1 Nef expressing cells. In contrast, SIV Nef induced CD4 downregulation resulted mostly from enhanced endocytosis and was dramatically reversed by genetic inhibitors of endocytosis or siRNA driven knock down of AP-2 complexes. In contrast to the mechanisms outline above, Nef induced a predominant AP-1 dependent vesicular trapping of the HLA-I receptor during its transit from the Golgi vesicles to the plasma membrane and during receptor recycling from the cell surface.',\n",
       " 'CD4 is a surface molecule of human helper T-lymphocytes that serves as the receptor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS. We have focused on two areas related to CD4 and HIV: 1) Structure function studies of the interaction of CD4 with the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp120 gp41 complex). The focus of this work is to identify structural changes in the envelope glycoprotein which occur upon CD4 binding, and which are involved in virion fusion with the cell membrane. Soluble CD4 was found to promote specific dissociation of gp120 from the envelope glycoprotein complex. Studies with synthetic peptide derivatives suggested that a particular region of CD4 (the CDR3 region) plays a critical role in inducing this structural change. Future efforts will focus on detailed analysis of the sites on CD4 and the envelope glycoprotein involved in fusion (using site-directed mutagenesis coupled with refined assays to measure membrane fusion)> We have also made progress in developing approaches to detect conformational changes leading to exposure of the presumed fusogenic regions of the envelope glycoprotein. 2) Design of CD4-based therapeutics for the treatment individuals infected with HIV. We have continued to study a genetically engineered hybrid toxin (CD4-PE40) which is targeted to selectively kill HIV-infected cells. Previous work demonstrated potent anti-HIV activity against infected T- cells and monocyte marcophages (primary cultures and continuous cell lines); the toxin was also shown to have highly synergistic effects with reverse transcriptase inhibitors. We have now found that CD4-PE40 is active against cells expressing diverse forms of HIV and SIV envelope glycoproteins, which differ in extent of processing, presence of a cytoplasmic tail, and binding affinity for CD4. These results suggest that the activity of CD4-PE40 may not be compromised in vivo by normal variations in envelope glycoprotein structure. We are now developing assays to test the activity of the hybrid toxin against primary isolates of HIV, including variants which have been shown to be highly refractory to neutralization by soluble CD4. We will also test newly developed CD4-PE40 constructs for possible enhanced anti-HIV activity. ',\n",
       " 'A productive infection by vaccinia virus involves entry into the cell, expression and replication of the genome and assembly and release of infectious, enveloped, virus particles. Many of these steps involve interactions of viral proteins with cellular proteins or membranes. Combined genetic, biochemical, and electron microscopic approaches are being used to investigate these complex processes. During the past year, emphasis has been on understanding the steps in the formation and transmission of intracellular and extracellular virions.',\n",
       " 'Class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) bind antigens and present them to T cells bearing CD8 molecules. CD8 positive T-cells play a critical role in eradicating intracellular pathogens (particularly viruses) and tumors. They can also contribute to immunopathology, being involved in organ rejection and autoimmune diseases. There has been rapid progress in understanding the physical nature of the antigen-class I complex, and in how antigens are generated and become associated with class I molecules in cells. Peptides of 8 to 15 residues produced from a cytosolic pool of proteins by cytosolic proteases are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a MHC encoded transporter complex known as TAP. Once in the ER, peptides (sometimes after further trimming) bind to class I molecules and are transported to the cell surface. This project aims to understand how peptides are generated, delivered and assembled with MHC class I molecules. In addition, one of the curious features of T CD8+ responses to viral infections is that it typically focuses on a highly limited set of peptides. This phenomenon, termed immunodominance, is crucial to understand if we are to develop vaccines that optimally elicit CD8 positive T-cell responses. To understand this phenomenon, we continue to investigate the various factors that contribute to immunodominance, including antigen processing and presentation of viral proteins, T cell regulation, and the T cell receptor repertoire.',\n",
       " 'Human CD94 NKG2A is an inhibitory receptor that recognizes HLA-E and is expressed by NK cells and a subset of T cells. To elucidate the cell surface dynamics of CD94 NKG2A receptors, we have expressed CD94 NKG2A-EGFP receptors in the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell line. Photobleaching experiments revealed that CD94 NKG2A-EGFP receptors move freely within the plasma membrane and accumulate at the site of contact with ligand. The enriched CD94 NKG2A-EGFP is markedly less mobile than the nonligated receptor. We observed that not only are lipid rafts not required for receptor polarization, they are excluded from the site of receptor contact with the ligand. Furthermore, the lipid raft patches normally observed at the sites where FcepsilonR1 activation receptors are cross-linked were not observed when CD94 NKG2A was coengaged along with the activation receptor. These results suggest that immobilization of the CD94 NKG2A receptors at ligation sites not only promote sustenance of the inhibitory signal, but by lipid rafts exclusion prevent formation of activation signaling complexes. Also, we have identified the location of the basal promoter of the human NKG2A gene and have shown that it contains a GATA binding site important for its promoter activity. We have shown that GATA-3 is capable of transactivating NKG2A promoter activity and that it is involved in regulating the expression of endogenous NKG2A. Taken together, our data indicate that GATA-3 is an important transcription factor for regulating NKG2A gene expression in NK cells.',\n",
       " '1. A continuing effort involves studies of a defective MuLV (BM5def) responsible for induction of murine AIDS (MAIDS) whose only product is a Gag protein which differs from the Gag polyprotein of a nonpathogenic ecotropic virus in the carboxyterminus of MA(p15) and throughout much of a p12. In an attempt to understand how these altered p15 and p12 contributes to the development of lymphoproilferation an immunodeficiency we made several attempts to generate mice expressing BM5 def-Gag from a transgene. These studies, where Gag sequences were driven by SV40 promoter and IgH Eu enhancer or MHC class II E alpha promoter, yielded mice bearing the transgenes, but without any expression. More recently, after several rounds of unsuccessful infections with BM5def genomic DNA, higher frequency transfer was achieved. Sufficient numbers of mice are now available for studies of expression of these genes and also for challenge with replication competent ecotropic MuLV as well as the LP-BM5 mixture of viruses from which BM5def was originally isolated. 2. Although genomes of xenotropic and polytropic (MCF) viruses are present in many copies in all inbred strains of mice, the presence of ecotropic viral genomes is variable (0-5 copies) indicating a recent introduction of these viral genomes in inbred mice. Ecotropic viruses isolated from wild-mouse populations of various regions of the world are different structurally, whereas, ecotropic viruses isolated from inbred strains are very similar, if not identical, as measured by restriction endonuclease mapping analyses. A search for the presence of ecotropic virus genome present in the inbred populations from the wild lead us to identify a region in Denmark where the DNAs of the wild mouse population harbors one copy of this ecotropic virus genome.

       " 'Alpha beta T cells respond to complexes of peptide antigen and MHC molecules. The way in which protein antigens are transformed into peptides suitable for such binding and the intracellular pathways followed by MHC molecules both before and after peptide association are critical to our understanding of T cell immunity. We have used normal and gene transfected cells to examine the issues. Class II molecules are efficiently assembled and transported in cells deficient in MHC class I molecule folding and stability due to an absence of peptide transporters in the ER membrane, indicating no absolute requirement for ER peptides or invariant chain in promoting initial class II dimer assembly and ER egress. However, these cells and other transfected fibroblasts are inefficient in exporting MHC class II out of the ER unless invariant chain is present. Only the lumenal and transmembrane portions of invariant chain are needed for this chaperone function, whereas the cytoplasmic tail of invariant chain is critical for guiding class II molecules to the endosomal pathway. Invariant chain has the capacity to alter the structure of early endosomes and change the rate of movement of endocytosed proteins through this early sorting compartment. Deletion of 10 residues in the invariant chain cytoplasmic tail retains the endosomal targeting capacity while eliminating the ability to modify early endosomes. In this case, invariant chain and class II enter late endosomes, and the invariant chain that accumulates here, in contrast to that in early endosomes, is cleaved in the lumenal region. Because Langerhans cells show what seem to be related changes in class II- invariant chain localization and endosomal structure concordant with alterations in the efficiency of peptide loading, we suggest that invariant chain and class II movement through the endosomal pathway is an event regulated by progressive proteolytic deletion of signals in invariant chain. This regulation may have a role in the normal physiological control of the efficiency of the class II processing pathway. ',\n",
       " 'In the past year, the scientific program in the newly organized Molecular Virology Section of LMM has focused on three broad areas. These encompass: I) Molecular Regulation of HIV-1; II) Molecular Regulation of HTLV-I; and III) Molecular applications relevant for the development of HIV-1 specific ribozymes and transdominant attenuated human immunodeficiency viruses. Here in a short format, it is not possible to present comprehensively our accomplishments over the past year. Details of our research can be better appreciated from the annual bibliography. However, we can capsulize our progress in 1993- 1994 with the following 11 points. Selected findings from our research program include: 1) Understanding crucial interactions between Sp1 and HIV-1 Tat; 2) Obtaining evidence that HIV-1 expression is influenced by integration and replication; 3) Demonstrating that the second exon of Tat contributes to optimal expression from the viral LTR; 4) Providing evidence that Tat has a novel function in viral infectivity; 5) Elucidating the activation of cellular RNA-binding proteins in response to DNA-damaging events; 6) Identifying the human autoantigen La as a novel TAR RNA-binding protein; 7) Mapping the expressed gene of TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) to human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 15; 8) Delineating the minimal activation domain in the HTLV-I transactivator, Tax; 9) Characterizing interactions between Tax and tumor suppressor p53; 10) Constructing expression competent Rev(-) HIV-1 for use as a possible live-attenuated vaccine; and 11) Quantitating the intracellular efficiencies of five ribozymes targeted to separate loci in the HIV-1 genome. Additional examples of studies that are ongoing and have yet reached \"critical mass\" include 1) developing through mutagenesis a minimally active ribozyme for HIV-1; 2) studying the roles of PKR in suppressing HIV-1 mRNA translation; 3) creating HIV-1 infectious genomes that could be treated with ganciclovir; 4) selecting for novel cellular factors that binds HIV-1 regulatory proteins using the yeast two- hybrid system; 5) engineering human parvovirus Rep gene product as a dominant suppressor of HIV-1 replication; 6) analyzing cellular genes that are induced by Tat using differential display technology; 7) selecting in vivo for more efficient Tat gene products.

       " \"Having completed a decade of work on antiviral treatment of genital herpes, we turned last year to studies of disease prevention. We began with phase I assessment of a new recombinant HSV-2 glycoprotein D vaccine in alum. We recruited 24 adults, some with and without prior HSV-1 and or 2 infection. Vaccinations of 30ug or 100ug were given at 0, 1, 2, and 12 months and were associated with minimal local or systemic reactions. ELISA titers to gD and gB, neutralizing antibodies to HSV2 and lymphocyte blastogenesis are being tested serially . By 18 months of study we've shown excellent primary immune responses to gD and marked (7-15 fold) boosts of titers in previously infected subjects. On the basis of these excellent responses we enrolled 40 patients with recurrent genital herpes into a placebo-controlled vaccine trial in collaboration with the Univ. of Washington. The goal is to determine whether boosted immunity leads to less frequent recurrences. In the coming year we will complete these studies and begin to explore adjuvants and vaccinations with gB and gD. \",\n",
       " \"Infection of humans by Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) can result in a multisystemic, chronic disease with diverse manifestations. We are investigating B. burgdorferi at several levels in order to understand some aspects of the disease pathogenesis. These studies include genetic manipulations of the spirochete and characterization of key structural and regulatory elements. 1. Molecular Characterization: Several features of Bb are being addressed. We have characterized homologous recombination between the genes encoding the major outer surface proteins (Osps) that both deletes osp gene sequences and creates chimeric gene fusions. Bb expressing recombinant osp genes can 'escape' killing by Osp-specific neutralizing antibodies. We are also investigating mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of osp gene expression. Isolating and studying genes whose expression is increased after a temperature upshift (heat shock genes) will provide information about their roles in cell growth, pathogenesis, plasmid replication and adaptation to stress. Understanding the mechanism of linear plasmid replication may yield a new target for antibiotics, in addition to shedding light on ways in which organisms manipulate their genetic material. 2. Gene Transfer: In order to allow genetic analysis of Bb, a method for gene transfer into Borrelia is being developed. A derivative of the Bb 16 kb linear plasmid will be used as a vector for electroporation, allowing for maintenance of transferred DNA in a native setting. DNA encoding recombinant Osp proteins that lack neutralizing epitopes will be introduced as a selectable marker. 3. cDNA Library: Extended passage of Bb in vitro eliminates its ability to infect rodents without any obvious differences in protein synthesis. cDNA libraries of high and low passage Bb are being constructed and clones derived from putative low abundance, differentially expressed messages will be identified by subtractive methods. A similar approach will be taken to identify messages that are differentially expressed in response to other biologically relevant stimuli. \",\n",
       " 'Careful structural analysis of the DNA content of several early passage and laboratory adapted strains of Borrelia burgdorferi has revealed, in addition to an approximately 1000 kilobase (kb) genome, a unique collection of terminally crosslinked, linear and covalently closed, circular DNA molecules ranging in size from 1.5 to 50 kb in length. Often DNA contour length profiles appear to differ among isolates and to vary during laboratory passage. Since accurate structural characterization by agarose gel electrophoresis alone is difficult, nucleic acid electron microscopy techniques were used extensively in these studies to assess molecular form, sequence arrangement and genetic relatedness. Each of the linear molecules was shown to rapidly reanneal to linear duplexes after alkaline denaturation, and to form single-stranded, circular molecules measuring twice the length of the linears upon treatment with a combination of methyl mercury, glyoxal, urea and heat prior to mounting for electron microscopy. Both circle formation and rapid reannealing could be prevented by brief pretreatment with single-strand specific nucleases. Furthermore, after enzymatic removal of the terminal crosslink, separable single-stranded molecules could then be compared directly by conventional heteroduplex analysis techniques. Partial denaturation of either intact or single-strand specific nuclease treated molecules showed profiles suggesting that the highest G+C content in each of the linear molecules examined was located near the molecular termini. However, heteroduplex analysis of enzymatically nicked linears revealed little or no inter-strand interaction. A technique was developed for the separation of terminal restriction fragments away from internal fragments using alkali denaturation, followed by a very brief incubation period to allow for concentration independent reannealing and final purification of snap-back, terminal fragments by ion exchange column chromatography. The purified terminal fragments were futher characterized and found to resemble human telomeres in molecular structure. ',\n",
       " 'Chlamydia trachomatis is the etiological agent of several significant diseases of humans including trachoma, the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide. It is also the most common cause of sexually transmitted disease in the USA. Other species of medical importance include C. pneumoniae, a causative agent of upper respiratory tract infections and possibly associated with atherosclerosis, and C. psittaci, which is primarily a pathogen of animals but occasionally is transmitted to humans. The Host-Parasite Interactions Section studies the fundamental cellular and molecular biology of intracellular pathogens. Efforts have been primarily with the genus Chlamydia and include two basic research areas: i.) the cellular interactions that promote entry and intracellular growth; primarily those controlled by secreted chlamydial effector proteins and ii.) global regulation of chlamydial gene expression by histone-like proteins. Establishment of a protected intracellular niche is a critical stage of the chlamydial developmental cycle. We have therefore focused much of our efforts over the last several years upon events occurring within these early stages of infection. Many of these events are unique among intracellular pathogens but common to the genus Chlamydia. The experimental approaches are heavily weighted toward cell biology, proteomics, and functional analysis of protein-protein interactions. An improved understanding of the distinct developmental stages and the cellular responses to them may suggest novel means of chemotherapeutic or immunologic intervention of chlamydial diseases. Chlamydiae occupy a unique vacuolar niche within the host cell. The chlamydial inclusion, unlike vacuoles containing other intracellular pathogens, is not interactive with endocytic vesicular trafficking pathways but is instead fusogenic with an incompletely understood exocytic pathway which delivers sphingomyelin and cholesterol from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Entry into this pathway is an active process on the part of the chlamydiae as both de novo transcription and translation are required. Virtually all of these interactions are specific and localized to the inclusion. This specificity strongly suggests modification of the exposed inclusion membrane. Examples of cis-acting modifications to the nascent inclusion membrane include: evasion of lysosomal fusion, interactions with microtubules to deliver the nascent inclusion to the peri-Golgi region and microtubule organizing center, initiation of fusion with exocytic vesicular traffic from the Golgi apparatus, and recruitment of, but not fusion with, recycling endosomes containing transferrin and its receptor. Many of these interactions are temporally associated with the exposure of inclusion membrane proteins to the host cell cytoplasm by a chlamydial type III secretion system. Another example of a chlamydial proteins controlling localized events could include the recruitment of actin to promote entry. A type III secreted protein, termed Tarp, is translocated and tyrosine phosphorylated while EBs are still extracellular. Tarp has been associated with the actin recruitment which is required for chlamydial internalization. Chlamydial Tarp and the inclusion membrane proteins define at least two distinct stages in chlamydial development where secreted effectors may play important roles in defining the outcome of infection. In the case of Tarp, a pre-existing effector protein is secreted across the plasma membrane from extracellular EBs, while inclusion membrane proteins require de novo synthesis and are secreted across the inclusion membrane from the RBs within. Identification of secreted effector molecules and their functions will continue to provide insights into the many adaptations chlamydiae utilize as successful pathogens. Chlamydial histone H1-like proteins, Hc1 and Hc2, act as globalregulators of chlamydial gene expression by virtue of dramatic effects on DNA structure. The chlamydial histones are transcribed late in the developmental cycle as RBs differentiate to EBs. The mechanisms of histone release from the chlamydial chromatin at the initiation of development had been unknown. By utilizing a heterologous screening protocol in E. coli, we identified two novel means of regulation of histone activity. The affinity of histone for DNA appears to be disrupted early in infection by the synthesis of a small metabolite in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. In the course of the screening procedure, we also identified a small regulatory RNA that specifically inhibits translation of Hc1.',\n",
       " \"A single-base deletion in the middle of the wild-type hepatitis A virus (HAV) HM-175 cDNA clone was discovered. This deletion resulted in a frame-shift mutation which probably accounted for the lack of infectivity of this full length cDNA clone. This deletion was corrected by oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis yielding a genome that was infectious when the 5' non-coding region of the cell culture adapted mutant was substituted for the corresponding wild type sequence. Analysis of the growth of chimeric HAV viruses differing only in the 5' non-coding region established that mutations in this region can impart a host range effect; viruses containing the 5' wild-type sequence were restricted in their replication in the simian CV-1 cell line compared to viruses containing the 5' sequence of the cell-culture adapted mutant. Thus, both the 5' non-coding region and the 2B 2C region of the viral genome contain important determinants of host range and replicative capacity in vitro. Greater than 95% of the sequence of a simian isolate of HAV was determined by direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction product obtained using specific primers and a homogenate of the liver of an infected African green monkey. The sequence differs substantially from that of any known human isolate of HAV. Preliminary studies demonstrated that this virus grows very efficiently in vitro in primary African green monkey kidney cells or in a continuous cell line of fetal rhesus kidney cells. The polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the sequence of the 5' non-coding and 2B 2C regions of the master seed pools of passage 21 and passage 32 lots of HAV candidate vaccine virus. A continuous simian cell line stably transformed with a plasmid containing the P2 region from the Sabin 1 strain of poliovirus was shown to support growth of HAV. In addition, the infectivity of the cell-adapted HAV mutant was increased 10 to 100-fold when assayed in the poliovirus P2 transformed cell line compared to the non-transfected parental cell line. \",\n",
       " \"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) appears to be the major current etiological agent of transfusion-related non-A, non-B hepatitis. The HCV genome is a linear, positive-strand RNA molecule of approximately 9,500 nucleotides and encodes a polyprotein of about 3,000 amino acids. Several stretches of amino acids in the HCV polyprotein share significant similarity with flavivirus and pestivirus proteins. Therefore, HCV is considered to be distantly related to these virus groups. The goal of this project is to increase our understanding of the molecular biology of this important human pathogen. Extensive sequence analysis has been performed on the 5' noncoding (NC) region, core, envelope 1 and hypervariable region (HVR1) of envelope 2 genes of over forty strains of HCV. In addition, neutralization assays, based upon blocking of attachment of virus to susceptible cells in vitro and prevention of infection of chimpanzees in vivo, have been developed and are being characterized for specificity and sensitivity. Prototype strains of the various genotypes of HCV, including some of those discovered in this laboratory, are being biologically amplified in chimpanzees and further characterized. Pools of virus-containing plasma will be packaged and distributed for further characterization, and used as challenge inocula in studies of passive and active immunoprophylaxis, etc. \",\n",
       " 'Dendritic cell (DC) production of IL-12 is thought to be a major initiation step in host resistance to Toxoplasma gondii. However, over-production of this cytokine can be detrimental to the host resulting in severe tissue damage. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) is a potent endogenous lipoxygenase-derived eicosanoid with antiinflammatory and proresolving properties. We have previously shown that supraphysiological levels of LXA4 are generated during T. gondii infection, which in turn reduces interleukin (IL) 12 production by dendritic cells, thus dampening Th1-type cell-mediated immune responses and host immunopathology. In this years work, we investigated the mechanism by which T. gondii\\'s stimulates LXA4 biosynthesis. Proteomic analysis of T. gondii extract (soluble tachyzoite antigen [STAg]), which preserves the immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory activity of the parasite, yielded several peptide matches to known plant lipoxygenases. To investigate their potential enzymatic function, we incubated STAg with arachidonic acid and found using LC-UV-MS-MSbased lipidomics that the parasite extract generated the production of both 15-HETE and 5,15-diHETE, indicating that T. gondii carries 15-lipoxygenase(15-LO)activity. In addition, T. gondii tachyzoites (the rapidly multiplying and invasive stage of the parasite) generated LXA4 when provided with exogenous arachidonic acid. Local administration of a plant (soybean) lipoxygenase itself reduced neutrophilic infiltration in murine peritonitis, demonstrating that 15-lipoxygenase possesses antiinflammatory properties. Importantly, administration of a plant 15-lipoxygenase generated endogenous LXA4 and mimicked the suppression of IL-12 production by splenic dendritic cells observed after T. gondii infection or STAg administration. These findings suggest that T.gondii stimulates LXA4 production by augmenting 15-lipoxygenase levels in the host through its own sythesis of the enzyme. On a broader level our studies indicate that enzymes involved in eicosonoid synthesis expressed by a pathogen can interact with host biosynthetic circuits to generate lipoxins that act as endogenous \"stop signals\" suppressing the host immune response and limiting acute inflammation.',\n",
       " 'PrP is a normal endogenous protein of unknown function in brain and a variety of other mammalian tissues. In the brains of animals afflicted with scrapie and other transmissible degenerative neuropathies, PrP accumulates in a proteinase K (PK)-resistant form which can aggregate into fibrils and form amyloid-like plaques. There is substantial evidence that the formation of the PK-resistant PrP is scrapie specific and important in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, it is not yet clear whether the PK-resistant is the transmissible agent itself, a component of the agent, or a pathological byproduct of the disease. Since the replication or pathogenesis of the scrapie agent may involve the production of PK-resistant PrP, we have continued studies of the properties and biosynthesis of both the PK-resistant and normal forms of PrP in tissue culture cells. We have determined that in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells, the two forms of PrP dimer in their aggregation states, N-termini, turnover rates and sensitivities to protease and phospholipase treatments of intact cells. We have extended our studies of normal PrP biosynthesis to rat PC12 cells, and have found that the size of PrP precursors and products, the kinetics of PrP biosynthesis, and the linkage of PrP to the plasma membrane by phosphatidyl inositol are similar to those in mouse neuroblastoma cells. Studies of the scrapie agent derived from mouse neuroblastoma cells have indicated that, like the brain-derived agent, ft can be slowly neutralized by high concentrations of PK. This indicates that has an essential protein component. However the infectivity is resistant to treatment with a variety of nucleases suggesting that it contains no nucleic acid or that the nucleic acid is protected by other components of the preparation. It is possible that a conformational abnormality accounts for the characteristics of PK-resistant PrP. To investigate this possibility, we have purified PK-resistant PrP from scrapie brain tissue and are initiating secondary structure analysis of it by infrared spectroscopy. Ultimately, we hope to be able to ascertain whether its conformation differs from that of the normal PrP. ',\n",
       " '1) Neonatal tolerance. Female mice can be primed by male dendritic cells or tolerized by male spleen cells up to day 24 after birth. Thus neonates are not especially tolerizable. They can be immunized by professional APCs as long as the inoclum does not contain a large proportion of non-APC cells. 2) Maternal tolerance. Using quantitative PCR for the Y chromosome we occasionally find male cells in the organs of pregnant mice. This traffic is very sporadic however and we conclude that it is unlikely to be a major mechanism by which the fetus alters the mother\\'s immune response. 3) Results of tolerance in Tg mice. To test which haplotypes support the development of a Tg TCR derived from an F1 mouse, we created T cell clones from F1 mice, isolated the genes for their antigen specific receptors and generated Tg mice. The first two transgenics are now being bred to create the appropriate test animals. Two more are on the way. THE THYMIC STEM CELL - is it precommitted Frequency estimates indicate that each 11 day fetal thymus lobe contains a single CFUS stem cell. Thus there are uncommitted stem cells in the early fetal thymus. T CELL MEMORY - We are studying killer cell memory in mice depleted of T helper cells. Preliminary results suggest that killer cell memory lasts at least 3 months in the absence of T helper cells. NEW THIS YEAR. Two major theories, one on memory and one on the fundamental \"raison d\\'etre\" of the immune system. On Memory: Both short and long term memory are maintained by re- stimulation of memory cells: short term memory by antigen retained by Follicular Dendritic cells and long-term memory by cross- reactive environmental antigens or by re- infection with the original pathogen. The immune system recognizes \"danger\" not \"non-self\": \"Danger\" is defined by the immune system as cell stress or non-apoptotic death, eg. lysis caused by a cut or a viral infection. This activates local antigen presenting cells (APCs) which take captured antigens to the nearest lymph node and present them to passing T cells. immune responses are only initiated when abnormal death activates APCs. T cells able to see the normal surface MAP of APCs are deleted in the thymus and any T cells able to see other bodily tissues are deleted in the periphery. This peripheral deletion occurs because resting T cells are programmed to die if they bind antigen unless they receive a special APC-derived activating signals. Thus any T cell specific for a peripheral (non-APC) tissue dies when it binds to that tissue. This view of the immune system explains many phenomena that the old self-non-self view does not and it offers several new strategies for the treatment of tumors and for successful organ transplantation.

       " 'An intensive effort was directed toward attempting to better understand the immunopathologic mechanisms underlying the immunodeficiency of HIV-1 infection. To determine whether or not alterations in the fine specificity of the CD4+ T lymphocyte repertoire could underly the defect, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based technique was used to determine the relative levels of mRNAs encoding the T cell antigen receptor beta- chain for each of the 24 human variable domain beta-chain subfamilies. Disruptions of the normal size pattern were noted in the majority of patients with HIV infection, particularly those patients with low CD4+ T lymphocyte counts. While protease or IL-2 therapy could result in substantial increases in CD4+ T lymphocyte numbers, they led to little if any changes in the distribution of size patterns. The HIV-hu PBL-SCID model was employed to study the immune systems of long-term non-progressors and to evaluate the potential anti-viral activity of novel therapeutic interventions. Mice reconstituted with PBMC from long-term non-progressors failed to show evidence of CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion. The nucleoside analogue FddA was found to be a potent anti-retroviral compound. CD8+ T lymphocytes from patients with HIV infection were found to have increased expression of the activiation markers HLA-DR, CD57, CD45RO and Fas. These cells were unable to be stimulated by standard signals. Analysis of these cells revealed increased levels of cdk2 and cyclin E as well as persistence of p27kip, suggesting that they were blocked at the G1 S checkpoint of the cell cycle. A similar phenotype could be generated in vitro by stimulation of CD8+ T lymphocytes from healthy donors with PHA only in the absence of IL-2 suggesting that this in vivo observation may stem from in vivo activation of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the absence of the second signals provided by CD4+ T lymphocytes. Analysis of the T cell receptor repertoire in the CD8+ T lymphocytes of patients with HIV infection revealed that while the DR- subpopulation represented a polyclonal population, the DR+ subpopulation of cells was oligoclonal.

       " 'It is now well documented that Crohn\\'s disease is associated with a Th1 T cell-mediated inflammatory response and, as such, it is driven by the \"master\" Th1 cytokine(s), IL-12 (and possibly IL-23). Previous studies initially performed in this laboratory established that anti-IL-12 was an effective treatment of experimental mucosal inflammation due to a Th1-driven process. On this basis, we participated in the development of a fully human (monoclonal) anti-IL-12 (anti-p40) by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for treatment of patients with Crohn\\'s disease. This eventuated in a (phase I-II) double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of anti-IL-12 in 79 patients with active Crohn\\'s disease studied at the NIH and other medical centers. In this study patients were randomly assigned to receive seven weekly subcutaneous injections of 1 or 3 mg kg of anti-IL-12 or placebo with either a four week interval between the first and second injection (Cohort 1) or no interruption (Cohort 2). Patients in Cohort 2 receiving 3 mg kg antibody showed significant differences in response rates (highest response rate 75% at week 6) and remission rates (highest remission rate 50% at week 19) compared to patients receiving placebo, whereas the high clinical response and remission rates in Cohort 1 patients receiving antibody were not significantly different from the placebo group. The effects of antibody treatment were durable and adverse events were comparable to placebo except for mild local injection reactions. In patients studied at the NIH, the effect of treatment on cytokine production by lamina propria cells extracted from biopsy speciments were studied. Anti-IL-12 treatment were accompanied by significant decreases in IL-12, IFN-gamma, IL-17, and TNF-alpha production, but no effect on IL-4 or IL-10 production. These studies show that monoclonal anti-IL-12 is an effective treatment of active Crohn\\'s disease and pave the way for a phase III trial in a large patient cohort. In addition, it provides solid proof that a Th1 process is the final common T cell pathway of inflammation in Crohn\\'s disease.',\n",
       " 'Epidemics of enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis (hepatitis E) have been reported in Asia, Africa, and North America but not in the United States or Canada. Similar cases of sporadic hepatitis, presumed to be hepatitis E, account for up to 90% of reported acute hepatitis in countries where hepatitis E is endemic. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been implicated in fulminant hepatitis of pregnancy. This disease has a 20% fatality rate. That a viral agent was responsible for hepatitis E epidemics was first shown in 1983. The genome of HEV consists of a single strand of positive sense RNA that contains 3 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes nonstructural proteins, ORF2 encodes the principal capsid protein, and ORF3 encodes a protein of unknown function. The goal of this project is to characterize HEV, to determine the extent and pattern of its involvement in enterically transmitted hepatitis, and to develop a vaccine for the prevention of hepatitis E.

       " 'Following the IgE-mediated activation of mast cells, and the immediate allergic response, lymphocytes enter the inflammatory site, and are believed to secrete cytokines that promote the late inflammatory response, or late phase reaction. The mast cell derived molecules that promote lymphocyte chemotaxis are largely unknown. We have thus recently focused on this step in the allergic inflammatory response and have identified both a chemokine (lymphotactin [Ltn] and a cytokine (IL-16) produced by mast cells that may contribute to the ingress of lymphocytes, and the stimuli that regulate their synthesis and release. Using RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, we found that the Ltn gene is inducible in C1.MC C57.1 and murine bone marrow-cultured mast cells (BMCMC) by FceRI aggregation. Activation of a human mast cell or basophil cell line similarly led to transcription of Ltn. FceRI aggregation-dependent Ltn mRNA expression was maximal at 6 h, independent of de novo protein synthesis, and was inhibited by cyclosporin A and dexamethasone. Compared with macrophage inflammatory protein alpha (MIP- 1a), FceRI-dependent Ltn and MIP-1a mRNA levels were up-regulated by IL-4, but not IFN-g, although higher levels of IL-3 inhibited Ltn expression only. TGF-b preferentially enhanced FceRI-dependent Ltn mRNA levels. A rabbit polyclonal Ab against a synthetic peptide was developed for use in immunoblot analysis and detected a 15-kDa Ltn protein within mast cell pellets and in supernatants of mast cells following FceRI aggregation. Similarly, IL-16 is stored preformed in bone marrow cultured human mast cells (BMCMC) and a human mast cell line, as demonstrated by intracytoplasmic cytokine staining and flow cytometry; and in human lung mast cells as detected by immunohistochemistry. In response to the anaphylatoxin, C5a, or PMA treatment, IL-16 mRNA transcripts detected by Northern blot analysis in HMC-1 cells increased 6 to 10 fold. HMC-1 cell lysates and activated supernatants contained IL-16 protein as demonstrated by both ELISA and in vitro lymphocyte chemotaxis assays, the later of which was blocked 59-88% by the addition of neutralizing antibody to recombinant human IL-16. IL-16 bioactivity was detected in the supernatants 2 to 4 h after PMA or C5a activation, and this activity remained elevated through 24 h. The capacity of mast to thus synthesize and release Ltn and IL-16 provides a possible link between mast cell activation and the accumulation of T cells in mast cell-dependent inflammation, thus amplifying the immune response and perpetuating the pathological process. The expression of novel genes in mast cells after activation is also being examined by means of screening of activation cDNA libraries. Some of these clones isolated represented genes that are known to be upregulated in mast cells after activation, such as Ltn and MIP-la. Several of the clones represent new genes. The expression of these genes is being examined by Northern blot analysis and the genes characterized. ',\n",
       " 'A universal problem in biology is the interpretation of the half-maximal response of a cell population to a stimulus. Either all the cells are producing only one-half of their maximal potential, or one half of the cells are producing at their full potential while the other half are producing nothing. To decide between these two alternatives we examined the production of interleukin 2 by single T cell clones at different concentrations of antigen. The response appeared to be quantal (all or more) but two different levels of response were observed, one approximately 3-4 times the other. Furthermore, the dose response curve was biphasic with a decrease in the number of cells in each group at higher (>30nM) antigen concentrations. Our interpretation of these results is that induction of transcription of the IL-2 gene is what is quantal. Thus, the group of cells giving the low level of IL-2 production had only one chromosome being transcribed, whereas the group giving the higher level of IL-2 production was transcribing both chromosomes. The fact that all the cells were not found in the high positive group at large antigen concentrations possible reflects a negative feedback regulation on IL-2 transcription. Experiments are currently in progress to test these two hypotheses. ',\n",
       " 'Neutrophils and other circulating phagocytes generate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response infectious or inflammatory stimuli in a process known as the respiratory burst. This response is attributed to the activity of NADPH oxidase that produces superoxide, a precursor of ROS that are important microbicidal agents and mediators of inflammation. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) have NADPH oxidase deficiencies and suffer from enhanced susceptibility to microbial infections and aberrant inflammatory responses. This project explores the cellular mechanisms regulating the respiratory burst oxidase in phagocytes (phox system) and is characterizing related enzymes expressed in non-immune cells (Nox and Duox oxidases). We are characterizing sources of reactive oxygen species in non-myeloid tissues, notably colon, kidney, thyroid and salivary glands, mucosal surfaces, brain, and vascular tissue. Recent evidence from this lab indicates that several of these oxidases also serve in host defense and inflammatory processes, since these oxidase homologues are predominately expressed on apical surfaces of epithelial cells. The reactive oxidants produced by these enzymes can also provide redox signals that alter gene expression patterns that mediate proliferation responses to growth factors, differentiation, cellular senescence, apoptosis or programmed cell death, and oxygen sensing. In studies on the colon oxidase, we examined expression patterns of Nox1 in colon epithelial cells and demonstrated that Nox1 is induced by terminal differentiation or by interferon-gamma treatment. Nox1 functionally replaces gp91phox, restoring stimulus-dependent superoxide release in cells co-expressing the cytosol factors p47phox and p67phox. We identified unique, colon-specific homologues of these cytosolic factors, showing that Nox1 is a regulated, phox-like complex that can act in host defense and inflammatory processes in the colon epithelium. We have compared the functions of variably spliced isoforms of Nox1 and its co-factors in several cell models. Related work is examining the structural requirements and sub-cellular location of Nox1-supportive components and tracking their movement in response to cellular activation. Nox1 and Nox3, the closest homologues of the phagocytic oxidase that both function as multi-component enzymes, also appear to involve p22phox as a subunit that stabilizes these oxidases and affects their sub-cellular localization. Furthermore, we have evidence suggesting both Nox1 and Nox3 function as Rac-dependent enzymes, like the phagocytic system. In a major effort this year aimed at exploring the functional role of the renal oxidase (renox or Nox4), we are characterizing four mouse strains in which the Nox4 gene is deleted. We are investigating the proposed role of Nox4 in renal oxygen sensing and erythropoiesis, since Nox4 levels appear to respond to hypoxia and ROS are thought to provide negative feedback signals regulating renal erythropoietin synthesis. The renal oxidase appears to be a constitutively active enzyme, consistent with its proposed role as an oxygen-sensing enzyme. Surprisingly, the Nox4- - mice exhibit a normal phenotype in the unstressed state; the hematology as well as serum and urine chemistries (i.e., urine peroxide levels) are normal in these animals. Current work is focusing on alterations in other redox generating or scavenging systems to understand mechanisms maintaining redox homeostasis in Nox4-deficient animals. Related studies are attempting to identify other functional components supporting the catalytic core of Nox4, such as Rac, p22phox, and cytosolic phox-like proteins. Finally, we are exploring the functional expression of dual oxidases (Duox1 and Duox2) in epithelial cells of airways (trachea, bronchium), salivary gland ducts, and the rectum. Their expression on apical surfaces of epithelial cells suggests these oxidases serve as sources of hydrogen peroxide supporting the anti-microbial activity of lactoperoxidase on mucosal surfaces. Recombinant forms of Duox2 have been produced and purified to examine the activity of the peroxidase homology domain in vitro. Primary cultured human airway (bronchial) and monkey salivary gland epithelial cells were shown to produce extracellular hydrogen peroxide in a Duox-dependent manner in response to physiological agonists that trigger calcium release. These primary culture systems are being developed to explore Duox expression in relation to epithelial cell differentiation and to confirm roles of these oxidases in anti-microbial defenses and inflammatory processes on mucosal surfaces.',\n",
       " 'The aim of this project is to define the molecular mechanisms and biological contexts for blood leukocyte migration to specific tissue sites that are inflamed or infected. We have focused on chemoattractant proteins that mediate this process and have identified members of a large family of chemoattractant receptors that are deployed on the leukocyte cell surface. We have also identified members of a diverse group of chemoattractant and chemoattractant receptor mimics made by viruses, including herpesviruses, poxviruses and HIV. We use genomics, molecular biology, cell biology and epidemiology as the principle methods for analyzing these molecules. A major goal is to identify specific disease associations of individual chemoattractant and chemoattractant receptors, in order to identify potential new therapeutic targets. A key strategy is to analyze phenotypes of gene knockout mice in disease models as well as associations of loss of function mutations in the corresponding human genes in human disease cohorts. In FY07 we continued our study of chemokine regulation of atherosclerosis. Extending our previous report in FY06 that pathogenic atherosclerosis-associated oxidized lipids are able to reciprocally regulate expression of the chemokine receptors CCR2 (decreased) and CX3CR1 (increased) on primary human macrophages developed from blood monocytes ex vivo, in FY07 we focused on the CX3CR1 ligand CX3CL1 and found that its expression was also upregulated by these pathogenic lipids, on both macrophages and primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs). The CX3CL1-CX3CR1 ligand-receptor pair is a major mediator of static adhesion of macrophages to CASMCs in this sytem. Together the results suggest a model for foam cell recruitment and retention within plaque in which CX3CL1-CX3CR1 act to coordinate adhesion of macrophages to CASMCs in the vessel wall through both homotypic and heterotypic adhesive interactions. This provides a novel model of atherogenesis and identifies CX3CL1-CX3CR1 as a potential new drug target in this disease. Moreover, the data provide an explanation at the molecular and cellular level for genetic and epidemiologic data we reported earlier showing that CX3CR1 is a proatherogenic factor. In FY07 we also defined a signal transduction pathway involved in CX3CL1 upregulation by oxidized lipids involving an autocrine paracrine TNF-dependent pathway and the transcription factor NF-kB. Interestingly, upregulation of CX3CR1 on macrophages by the same lipids occurs through a different mechanism involving the transcription factor PPAR-gamma. In FY07 we also defined F2L, a breakdown production of hemoglobin found at sights of inflammation, as a functional ligand for the formylpeptide receptor homologue FPR2. One of the first endogenous ligands found for this receptor, this new finding provides an important new direction for analyzing the biological role of FPR2.',\n",
       " 'Our objectives in this project have been to examine the details of the interaction of self and antigenic peptides with the MHC class I molecule by detailed kinetic and equilibrium binding methods, and by three- dimensional computer modeling of structures of MHC peptide complexes. Such studies permit us to examine underlying biochemical rules that govern the interaction of antigenic peptides with MHC molecules, which plays a central role in the initiation of the immune response. In addition, they provide a framework for understanding the larger question of how proteins bind small molecular weight peptide ligands. Major accomplishments in the past year include the further development and application of quantitative kinetic assays for measurement of the interaction of peptides with purified MHC molecules in real time, and the extensive analysis of the binding of a larger number of peptides. In addition, methods have been devised for the quantitative emptying of MHC class I molecules and the retention of their peptide binding activity. In addition, general methods are being developed for the chemical coupling of engineered molecules tagged with histidine residues to metal- conjugated biosensor surfaces. ',\n",
       " 'T cells are important effector cells in natural antiviral and anticancer immunity, and it is the ultimate goal of our studies to reveal the cellular and molecular requirements for T cell differentiation and effector functions. We continued exploration of a novel mechanism of T cell regulation that is based on the assumption of important roles of extracellular purines (ATP and adenosine) and purinergic receptors. Signaling through these receptors is propagated by phosphorylation dephosphorylation processes and results in modulation of TCR-driven effector functions of T-cells. It has been shown that expression of Gprotein-coupled purinergic receptors in activated thymocytes follows the pattern of an immediate early gene response where newly expressed cell surface purinergic receptors may provide regulatory feed-back signaling. The demonstration of TCR-antagonizing effects of extra cellular adenosine (extAdo) led us to propose an extAdo-based mechanism of an inherited disease, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), in adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient patients. In contrast to the current explanation of ADA SCID by the general lymphotoxicity of intracellular adenosine, we suggested the possibility of adenosine receptor-induced thymocyte and Tcell depletion. It has been shown that low concentrations of adenosine strongly antagonized antigenic peptide or anti-TCR mAb-induced upregulation of activation markers and apoptosis. ExtAdo has especially strong effects on TCR-activated thymocytes with low or no adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity. The overall effect of extAdo was the \"rescue\" (increased short-term survival) of TCR-activated thymocytes in an in vitro assay that models negative selection of thymocytes. The A2a purinergic receptors are shown to be the predominant receptors for extAdo, which signal to increase levels of cAMP and to activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase in Tcells. According to our model, the extAdo may cause T cell depletion by A2a receptor-mediated abrogation of the TCR signaling required for positive selection, thereby allowing thymocytes to die from \"neglect.\" Similarly, the autoimmunity observed in ADA SCID patients is explained by the ability of extAdo to antagonize TCR-mediated signaling needed for negative selection, thereby allowing the survival of autoimmune T cells. We also demonstrated strong inhibitory effects of extAdo on TCR-triggered effector functions of T cells, thereby suggesting that in tissues with a high concentration of adenosine (e.g., hypoxic conditions of large solid tumors), the immune response could be inhibited. These observations point to A2a receptors as a novel molecular target for immunomodulation. ',\n",
       " 'Our ongoing in vivo and in vitro studies of functionally important cellular populations and of the role of individual proteins in effector functions of T-lymphocytes have obvious immunopharmacological implications since they identify the cell types and key proteins that should be targeted for efficient immunomodulation when there is a clinical need to inhibit or to enhance the intensity of the effector phase of the immune response. A. Synthetic peptides inhibitors pseudosubstrates of protein kinases as modulators of T-lymphocyte responses. We tested if it is possible to use peptides which mimic pseudosubstrate sequences or inhibitory domains of known protein kinases and demonstrated that such peptides are able to block functional responses of T-cells. Some peptides were only inhibitory, while PKA-inhibiting synthetic peptide was able to enhance the 1CR- triggered IL2 production of T-cells when directly delivered in the cytoplasm by hypotonic shock. The advantages of this synthetic peptide- based strategy for immunomodulation include the possibility of the rational design of individual peptides according to the defined properties of the targeted enzymes, achieving both biochemical and, hopefully, cell- specific specificity of novel inhibitors. B. The differential modulation of cytotoxic T cells effector functions. During the systematic studies of the effects of different enzyme inhibitors, anti-sense mRNA oligos and of different synthetic peptide inhibitors on lymphocyte functions we succeed in demonstration of the possibility to simultaneously inhibit some functions (e.g. gamma- interferon secretion) and to enhance other functions of the same cell (e.g. the cytotoxic \"lethal hit\" delivery and granule exocytosis) by TCR- triggered CTL by interfering with the activities of serine threonine PP2A phosphatase and of protein kinase A. This forms the basis for the development of the immunomodulating reagents which will selectively affect the partial reactions of the immune response. ',\n",
       " 'An. gambiae s.s. is known to be highly variable in terms of chromosomal polymorphisms which are related to chromosomal inversions. It has been suggested that these inversions are adaptive, allowing the species to occupy a variety of habitats and thrive. It is the highly adaptive nature of this species which makes it a powerful vector of human malaria. Our goal is to undertake an in-depth study of the genetic structure of An. gambiae s.s. and, in addition, to look for possible correlations between specific genetic polymorphisms and vectorial capacity for malaria. We will approach questions such as 1) How much gene flow or gene exchange is there among geographic populations and between individuals carrying different inversions 2) How is genetic polymorphism distributed within the genome 3) Is there a correlation between vectorial capacity and specific karyotypes ',\n",
       " \"During T cell development, autoreactive T cells are eliminated in the thymus through a mechanism known as clonal deletion. However, T cells which recognize self-antigens not expressed intrathymically are not deleted and represent a potential danger. Our studies have focused on understanding the pathogenesis of the autoimmune state, the role of cytokines in mediating autoimmune tissue damage, and the treatment of established autoimmune diseases by modulation of the cytokine inducing phenotype of the disease inducing T cells: 1) Thymectomy of three day old mice (3dTx) is followed by the development of organ-specific autoimmune diseases. We have identified the target antigen recognized by CD4+ T cells present in BALB c animals with gastritis and have definitively demonstrated that CD4+ T cells react with the major proton pump of gastric parietal cell, the H K ATP'ase. H K ATP'ase reactive T cell clones derived from animals with gastritis can transfer disease to immunocompromised recipients. 2) We have identified a unique population of suppressor T cells which are CD4+, IL-2 receptor+ which prevent autoantigen-specific T cells which are present in normal animals from producing disease. Depletion of the CD4+, IL-2R+ cells from normal populations abrogates their ability to inhibit disease when transferred into d3Tx recipients; furthermore, transfer of the depleted cells to nu nu recipients results in severe autoimmune disease. 3) Inbred strains of mice exhibit a spectrum of susceptibility to induction of autoimmune diseases including experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Detailed studies of B10.S mice which are resistant to the development of EAE demonstrated that this resistance was secondary to the failure of myelin basic protein (MBP) specific T cells to develop into Th1 cells which produce interferon gamma (IFNgamma). Induction of IFNgamma production by treatment of B10.S T cells with IL-12 lead to the development of encephalitogenic T cell populations. These results suggest that the association between intercurrent infections and presentation or relapses of autoimmune diseases may be secondary to IL-12 production in response to pathogens. On the other hand, our data support the view that antagonists to IL-12 may have therapeutic value in the treatment of inflammatory autoimmune diseases by inhibiting the activation and or action of Th1 T cells. \",\n",
       " 'An intensive effort was directed toward studying the potential therapeutic aspects of immunologic approaches to HIV infection. Studies evaluating the effects of interleukin (IL)-2 therapy continue to reveal sustained (i.e., up to 4 years in duration) increases in CD4+ T cells and decreased expression of activation markers on CD8+ T cells. The probability of manifesting an immunologic response was directly associated with baseline CD4+ T-cell count. Continued follow up of patients on a randomized controlled trial comparing IL-2 plus nucleoside analogs to nucleosides alone confirmed the durability of the CD4+ T-cell response and the absence of chronic HIV activation associated with cytokine treatment. Despite transient and consistent increases in viral load at the end of each IL-2 infusion, sustained increases in viral load were not present after 2 years of IL-2 treatment. A dose escalation trial evaluating the safety and immunologic activity of subcutaneously administered IL-2 comparing different doses and dose intervals was completed, and a phase II randomized controlled study was begun. Substantial increases in CD4+ T-cell counts were observed, and the magnitude of CD4+ T-cell rise correlated directly with baseline CD4+ T-cell counts. Toxicities of subcutaneous IL-2 were similar to those of intravenous IL-2, but less severe. A multicenter, randomized controlled study of subcutaneous IL-2 in more advanced subjects was initiated. A study evaluating the protease inhibitor indinavir plus intravenous IL-2 was continued and revealed persistent immunologic responses in patients previously unresponsive to IL-2 plus nucleosides. A study was continued in order to determine whether timing of IL-2 therapy around in vitro correlates of immune activity results in greater and more durable responses than administering IL-2 on a fixed regimen. A study generating random recombinatorial libraries of human immunoglobulin genes from HIV-infected individuals was continued. An anti-gp120 antibody that was identified is now being readied for clinical study. Evaluation of a candidate DNA vaccine in HIV uninfected individuals was initiated. Utilizing plasmid DNA containing the HIV env and rev genes as the immunizing agent, the study will determine the safety and immunogenicity of this agent, including the ability of immunization with this agent to generate cytotoxic T cell responses. Study of bacteriophage phi X174 immunization in both healthy and HIV-infected individuals was begun to assess whether bacteriophage clearance and immune responses will serve as useful correlates of immune competence. A study evaluating the survival and distribution of adoptively transferred, syngeneic, genetically modified lymphocytes, was expanded to evaluate the effect of repeated infusions and showed that immune clearance may account for shortened cell survival on re-exposure. A randomized controlled study testing multiple infusions of syngeneic CD8+ T cells genetically engineered with a chimeric CD4-zeta T cell receptor (TCR) was continued, demonstrating the safety and feasibility of this approach and the long-term persistence of transferred cells in the circulation and lymphoid tissues. A pilot study testing infusions of syngeneic CD4+ T cells genetically engineered with transdominant Rev and or anti-sense TAR genes was initiated. ',\n",
       " 'Dengue type 4 virus (DEN4) cDNA was used as a vector to express genes of the distantly related tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Full length chimeric TBE DEN4 cDNAs were constructed by substituting TBEV genes coding for proteins such as capsid (C), premembrane (M), envelope (E), or nonstructural protein NS1 for the corresponding sequences of DEN4. Full length RNA transcripts prepared from these cDNAs were used to transfect permissive simian cells. Two viable chimeric viruses that contained TBEV CME or ME genes were recovered. Compared to DEN4, chimeric TBE(ME) DEN4 virus grew to higher titer and produced larger plaques in simian cells. In contrast, chimeric TBE(ME) DEN4 virus produced smaller plaques on mosquito cells and grew to lower titer than DEN4. Analysis of viral RNA and proteins produced in TBE(ME) DEN4- and DEN4-infected mosquito or simian cells revealed that the chimera was restricted in its ability to enter and replicate in mosquito cells. In contrast, TBE(ME) DEN4 entered simian cells efficiently and its viral RNA was replicated more rapidly in these cells than was parental DEN4 viral RNA. Following intracerebral inoculation TBE(ME) DEN4 virus caused fatal encephalitis in both suckling and adult mice, while mice inoculated by the same route with DEN4 did not develop disease. However, unlike wild-type TBEV, chimeric TBE(ME) DEN4 did not cause encephalitis when adult mice were inoculated by a peripheral route. Adult mice previously inoculated with the chimera by a peripheral route were completely resistant to subsequent intraperitoneal challenge with 103 LD50 of TBEV, while mice previously inoculated with DEN4 were not protected. These findings indicate that: (i) the TBEV M and E genes of the chimeric virus are major protective antigens and induce resistant to lethal TBEV challenge, and (ii) other regions of the TBEV genome are essential for the ability of this virus to spread from a peripheral site to the brain. Success in constructing a TBE DEN4 chimera that retains the protective antigens of TBEV but lacks its peripheral invasiveness provides a new strategy for the development of live attenuated TBEV vaccines.

       " 'This project studies development of gene therapy vectors tested in their targeting of a variety of cultured cells and in animal models, with the overall goal of better targeting gene transfer into human peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitors (PBHP) as a target for clinical gene therapy to treat inherited immune deficiencies. The specific goals relating to gene therapy were to develop the pre-clinical systems of gene therapy that could then be applied to correct the genetic defect in the X-linked genetic form of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and the X-linked form of severe combined immune deficiency (XSCID). Also in collaboration with Dennis Hickstein of the NCI we are also collaborating on studies to develop gene therapy for leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD). Specifically, we developed a retrovirus vector producer cell line that secretes high titers of the MFGS vectors containing the gp91phox cDNA and recently developed new methods to concentrate that virus to high titer that we plan in the future to use in the clinic. Although we have previous studies vectors based on both the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), we have now developed novel lentivirus vectors to correct X-CGD or X-SCID based on the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus of the macaque type (SIV-mac) that very efficiently targets human, non-human primate and dog hematopoietic stem cells. We have conducted and are in the process of conducting large animal studies with these gamma retrovirus and lentivirus vectors. The NOD SCID immunodeficient mouse will accept grafts of human hematopoietic stem cells. Using the NOD SCID mouse human stem cell chimera we demonstrate the full functional correction of 10-20% of human neutrophils arising in this model from the mobilized peripheral blood stem cells of CGD patients transduced with SIV-gp91phox vector. This unprecedented level of gene correction in this model provides the basis for using this lentivector in a future clinical gene therapy trials for CGD. We have also developed RD114 pseudotyped SIV-common gamma chain (gc) vectors to treat XSCID. We also collaborated with Dr. Felsburg from the University of Pennsylvania who has a dog model of XSCID in which we have tested the ability of both our MFGS-gc and SIV-gc vectors to cure this disorder with in vivo gene therapy in this animal model. In vitro we have achieved levels of over 80% marking of dog stem cells using these vector. Specifically, we have used a novel approach for in vivo gene therapy in the XSCID dogs where 3 day old dogs are injected intravenously with corrected gene therapy vector. Using this method, a number of dog treated with either the gamma retrovirus-gc or SIV-gc vectors have achieved long term high level restoration of the immune system. This is a novel and unprecedented demonstration of the feasibility of in vivo gene correction using direct injection of gene therapy vector. In other studies we are examining the role of different growth factors in stimulating CD34+ stem cells to divide and to determine the relationship between entry into the cell cycle, ability to transduce with retrovirus vectors, and the maintenance or loss of long term engrafting potential. These studies are essential to achieving our goal of high levels of gene transfer into long term engrafting stem cell. In other studies we have studied the effects of low dose radiation or chemotherapy on the engraftment of stem cells in animal models. We have demonstrated high levels of engraftment of gene marked cells in mouse and non-human primate animal models using low intensity conditioning regimens consisting of non-ablative levels of total body radiation. Follow up studies are in progress looking at non-ablative chemotherapy regimens instead of using radiation, and preliminary studies suggested that the non-ablative combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine can achieve low level (0.3%) prolonged (greater than 1 year)gene transfer marking of blood cells in the primate model. Evidence from human and animal studies of gene therapy suggest that providing an in vivo growth or survival advantage to genetically corrected blood cells can improve the outcome of gene therapy by increasing the percent of corrected cells in the body. One approach to this is to co-express the therapeutic gene (such as the corrective gene for X linked CGD) with a gene that allows for selective enrichment. In studies with collaborators we have explored the use of the methyguanine methyl transferase (MGMT) which protects against alykating agents such as BCNU in a non-human primate model achieving marking rates of up to 20%.',\n",
       " 'This project involves the conduct of diagnostic, natural history assessment and therapeutic clinical trials for inherited immune deficiencies. This project specifically include studies of the diagnostic procedures (including genetic diagnosis), and treatment modalities that are alternatives to allogeneic transplantation and gene therapy (treatment modalities that are the subject of companion projects with the same types of patients). Patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) caused by mutations in the IL2RG gene encoding the common gamma chain (gc) of receptors for interleukins (IL)-2, -4, -7, -9, -15 and -21 often are treated as infants. XSCID patients are studied at NIH who have failed to achieve or maintain immune reconstitution after haveing as infants received non-conditioning haploidentical parental bone marrow transplants. Such patient often have waning immunity near the end of their first decade of life, and also have associated severe problems with short stature, malnutrition from gastointestinal malabsorption, various kinds of pulmonary dysfunction, and chronic sinusitis. We have noted a defect in response to growth hormone in such patients and have opened a clinical trial to treat short stature in these pre-adolescent XSCID children. We follow many patients with both autosomal and X-linked forms of chronic granulomatous disease (AR or X-CGD). Patients with CGD have defective circulating blood neutrophils that fail to produce microbicidal hydrogen peroxide. They suffer from recurrent life threatening infections and premature mortality. In addition to recurrent infections including many kinds of difficult to treat fungus infections, CGD patients often have a variety of autoinflammatory syndromes, but we have also noted a high incidence of actual defined autoimmune disorders such as Crohns disease of the gastrointestinal system as well as increased incidence of lupus erythematosis, sarcoidosis, and other syndromes of autoimmunity. We have an ongoing clinical trail of treatment of severe Crohns disease of CGD with infliximab. We also are finding that patients with CGD with autoinflammatory lung disease may respond to treatment with methotrexate, though studies are ongoing. Thus, we have increasingly recognized and documented that autoimmune problems can affect patients with a variety of primary immune deficiencies (PID). Many types of PID are more aptly characterized as diseases of immune dysregulation rather than just as immune deficiency with recurrent infections. We published a paper describing two patients in which chronic granulomatous disease appears to have triggered the development of sarcoidosis, an autoimmune disease not generally seen in CGD. This was the first report of sarcoidosis in CGD, but Crohns disease, discoid lupus erythematosis and rheumatoid arthritis have been noted in CGD patients. We proposed in this paper an important new paradigm in understanding CGD, suggesting that there is immune dysregulation associated with CGD that may trigger autoimmune diseases in a subset of patients where the specific autoimmune disease triggered likely related to an individual patients genetic predisposition to a particular autoimmune disease. This has important therapeutic management implications in that specific therapies proven to be effective for the specific autoimmune disease triggered by CGD must be used in such patients rather than just the general clinical management modalities designed to prevent infections or control the general inflammation common to most CGD patients. We have also in collaboration with Dr. Philip Murphy and Dr. David McDermott in the Lab of Molecular Immunity, NIAID and Dr. Sam Hwang in Dermatology, NCI begun to study the problems that affect patients with WHIM syndrome noting severe neutopenia, increased incidence of human papilloma related cancers and other problems such as chronic pulmonary disease. Studies are in progress to determine better treatments for this disorder. Study of WHIM also interfaced with our related project that seeks to understand the role of CXCR4 (defective in WHIM) in trafficking of hematopoietic cells, including CD34 stem cells into and out of the bone marrow.',\n",
       " 'This project is aimed at understanding the role of enzyme systems in host immune defense, specifically the NADPH oxidase. We are interested in understanding the role of the NADPH oxidase in the generation and control of inflammation and its role in protection from infection. This work will be informative on how to manipulate the host immune system pharmacologically and immunologically. We have used a mouse created in my laboratory that is deficient in the NADPH oxidase and closely mimics NADPH oxidase deficiency in humans, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). In addition to our work on the NADPH oxidase, we are pursuing the underlying basis of another host defense defect, hyper-IgE and recurrent infection syndrome or Jobs syndrome. Since this appears to be an autosomal dominant disease characterized by extremely elevated IgE, recurrent sino-pulmonary infections, osteopenia, kyphoscoliosis, pulmonary cysts, and dental abnormalities, identification of the gene(s) will be very important in our understanding of the host immune response as well as skeletal growth and development.

       " 'The identification, description, and treatment of congenital and acquired syndromes of increased susceptibility to infection primarily affecting the phagocytes, especially those related to nontuberculous mycobacteria have been our focus. These organisms are important pathogens only in the immunocompromised host, so we have sought to identify patients without recognized forms of immunocompromise who have these infections and then determine the nature of their susceptibility. In this way we can identify novel pathways involved in the control of mycobacteria and potentially other intracellular pathogens. We have identified several discrete abnormalities in these patients, all of which center around macrophage lymphocyte interactions leading to the production of interferon gamma. The study of these \"experiments of nature\" highlights the critical role of the macrophage lymphocyte interaction in control of mycobacteria and has led to the development of novel therapies that may have important applications in the most deadly infectious disease, tuberculosis.

       " 'A. Ribonucleases. We have identified and characterized a novel human ribonuclease, RNase k6 (Rosenberg and Dyer (1996) Nuc Acids Res 24: 3507-3513) and five novel murine ribonucleases related to those previously described in eosinophils (Batten et al. (1997) in review). We have also characterized the ribonucleases present in human monocytes (Egesten et al. (1997) BBA in press). We have progressed in our study of the gene regulation of the eosinophil ribonucleases, and shown that the intronic enhancer activity characterized for the gene encoding eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) is mediated by an NFAT-1 consensus binding site (Handen and Rosenberg (1997) J Biol Chem 272: 1665-1669). The NFAT-1 consensus site is also present in the LTR promoter of HIV, which we studied in the context of chemokine suppression of viral transcription (Handen and Rosenberg (1997) FEBS Lett. in press). B. Antiviral activity of eosinophil secretory proteins. We have shown that human eosinophils are active against isolated virions of both a laboratory strain of a murine retrovirus (Domachowske and Rosenberg (1997) J Leukoc Biol. in press) and, more important, against isolates of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), types A and B (Domachowske and Rosenberg (1997a) in review). Other studies have provided support for a role for eosinophils in the host defense against RSV (Domachowske and Rosenberg (1997b) in review). Finally, we have gone on to show that recombinant human eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, the major eosinophil ribonuclease, can act on its own as an antiviral agent against RSV (Domachowske and Rosenberg (1997c) in review), suggesting the possibility of developing EDN as aerosolized agent for the treatment of this respiratory infection (Rosenberg and Domachowske, provisional US patent NIH E-161-97 0 filed 7 2 97). C. Miscellany. Extending from our main projects, we have shown that the genomic structure of the eosinophil Charcot-Leyden crystal protein gene is analogous to those of the related sugar-binding galectins (Dyer and Rosenberg (1997) Genomics 40: 217-221).

       " 'CD8 positive T-lymphocytes play an important role in host immunity to viruses. Anti-viral CD8+ T-cells recognize MHC class I molecules bound to peptides derived from a cytosolic pool of viral proteins. Concerning the delivery of antigenic peptides to MHC class I molecules, our studies have addressed the following specific questions. First, there are two sources of antigenic peptides, native proteins and everything else. We have termed all the non-native sources, DRiPs, or defective ribosomal products and rapidly degraded proteins. DRiPs consist of prematurely terminated polypeptides and misfolded polypeptides produced from translation products of bona fide mRNAs in the proper reading frame. We have been analyzing the contribution of DRiPs to antigen presentation in viral infections. Second this project will examine the nature of the substrate from which antigenic peptides are derived and their contribution to antigen presentation. Third, these studies will examine potential mechanisms of delivering antigen to the class I processing pathway.',\n",
       " 'An azole resistant isolate of Candida albicans (Darlington) has been proven to be an erg3 (5,6 desaturase) mutant by showing restoration of ergosterol synthesis following transformation with ERG3 from a wild type strain. The transformant contained six tandem repeats of the ERG3- GAL1 construct and produced twice as much ERG3 transcript as Darlington. Restoring ergosterol synthesis caused a down regulation of ERG1 transcription in Darlington, showing coregulation of ERG3 and ERG11. Sequencing Darling ton ERG3 found allelic dimorphoism. One homologue contained a stop condon in the middle of the open reading frame. The other homologue had two changes in deduced amino acids that were in areas conserved in two other species. Considering that neither homologue produced functional 5,6 desaturase activity, one or both of the altered amino acids may be necessary for enzyme activity. This is the first demonstration that allelic heterozygosity in Candida albicans can differ to this extent at the same locus. The azole resistance of Darlington is not due to the erg3 mutation but is likely due to changes in two deduced amino acids which occur in conserved areas of erg11. Five previously normal patients with cryptococal meningitis were found to have NK cells in their peripheral blood which had a profoundly reduced capacity to kill C.neoformans. This abnormality was found even in patients who were completely recovered and may represent a predisposing factor to infection. Antibody to two different synthetic peptides, chosen from the amino-terminal sequence and from the copper-binding site were found to elicit antibodies which reacted with the full length protein expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

       " 'Although it is known that aspergillosis is caused by inhaled condidia, little is known about the precise events and interactions with the host that lead to successful survival and propagation of the fungus. During the initiation of aspergillosis, the surface of the inhaled conidia is the first fungal structure that comes in contact with the host. A. fumigatus condidia (spores) are known to be covered by a layer of hydrophobic proteinaceous fascicles called rodlets. The rodlet layer is believed to be responsible for the hydrophobic nature and the dispersibility of the spores. It has been shown that resting conidia of A. fumigatus with intact rodlet layers are killed much less effectively by human neutrophils that the swollen, rodletless hydrophobic conidia. It has been shown that hydrophilic conidia are more susceptible to neutrophil oxidative products and rabbit neutrophil cationic peptides. In addition, macrophages are also less able to kill hydrophobic spores that hydrophilic spores. We have cloned a gene responsible for the hydrophobicity of A. fumigatus conidia to study the survival of the conidia in the host tissue. PCR primers were constructed on the basis of highly conserved regions of the hydrophobin genes from three fungi were applied to A. fumigatus genomic DNA and a PCR product of 400bp fragment was isolated. The sequence of PCR product from A. fumigatus genome showed that it contained high sequence similarity with roda gene of Aspergillus nidulans. The PCR product was used for cloning the hydrophobin gene from genomic and cDNA libraries of A. fumigatus. A 4kb genomic DNA fragment and 1kb cDNA fragment were cloned and sequenced. The gene has two introns and codes a protein of 160 amino acids containing the 8 cysteines at the expected positions. The gene was designated as HYP1. HYP1 is developmentally regulated and expressed only when the culture reaches the sporulation stage. HYP1 gene was found to complement roda mutant of A. nidulans and restored rodlet layer in the fungus. This indicates that the HYP1 gene encosed the rodlet layer in A. fumigatus and that the gene is expressed in a heterologous host. ',\n",
       " 'CD8 expressing T cells play a critical role in eradicating intracellular parasites such as viruses. CD8 positive T cells recognize MHC class I molecules in a complex with peptides of 8 to 10 residues derived from viral proteins located in the cytosol. There is tremendous interest in the mechanism by which peptides are generated. Indirect evidence implicates proteasomes in the generation of antigenic peptides. Proteasomes are abundant macromolecular structures present in the cytosol and nucleus, and have multiple protease activities. They are thought to be responsible for energy dependent proteolysis in which ubiquitin plays a prominent role in targeting proteins for destruction. In this project we examine the contribution of proteasomes to the production of antigenic peptides as well as their importance to viral life cycles. Another goal is to identify sequences that enhance the immunogenicity of proteins by increasing their capacity to generate antigenic peptides. This project has also branched out into the study of the structure and function of individual viral proteins.',\n",
       " 'HIV is a complex retrovirus containing a number of genes not commonly found in other retroviruses. We are focusing on the analysis of two of these genes, vpu and vif. Vpu is encoded only by HIV-1 and encodes for a small integral membrane protein. Vpu independently regulates virus release from the cell surface and degradation of CD4 in the endoplasmic reticulum. We have previously shown that CD4 degradation involves a direct interaction with Vpu via their cytoplasmic domains. While the precise mechanism of degradation is still unclear, we have evidence that it is an energy-dependent process and requires ph HIV is a complex retrovirus containing a number of genes not commonly found in other retroviruses. osphorylation of Vpu. We have now analyzed the mechanism of Vpu-regulated virus release and found evidence that this function of Vpu is correlated with an ion channel activity of its transmembrane domain. Thus, while CD4 degradation requires sequences located in the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu (the TM domain can in this case be replaced by heterologous membrane anchors), Vpu-mediated virus release is sensitive to changes in the Vpu TM domain. From these findings we conclude that the two biological activities of Vpu are based on two independent and distinct molecular mechanisms that can be attributed to separable structural domains of Vpu. In a separate line of research we investigated virus release of HIV-2, which lacks a vpu gene. We found that Vpu can enhance HIV-2 virus release but only under conditions where the HIV-2 Env glycoprotein is not expressed. In the presence of the HIV-2 Env product, efficient virus release is observed which was not further enhanced by Vpu. We subsequently found that the HIV-2 Env product encodes a Vpu-like function that regulates, similar to Vpu, virus particle release. Like Vpu, HIV-2 Env is active not only in homologous systems but can regulate virus release of heterologous viruses such as HIV-1 or SIV. We are currently investigating which subdomains of the HIV-2 Env protein are involved in this phenomenon. Vif is a 23 kDa basic protein which has an important function in regulating infectivity of progeny virions. The biochemical mechanism of Vif function is obscure. We analyzed the role of Vif by studying its subcellular distribution by cell fractionation as well as confocal microscopy. We found that a substantial portion of intracellular Vif protein is associated with the cytoskeleton, specifically intermediate filaments. The association of Vif with intermediate filaments is specific and can result in the reorganization of the cytoskeletal network. In addition, we found that Vif is incorporated into virus particles where it associates with the core of the virions. Mutational analysis of Vif suggests that a domain located near the N-terminus of Vif is involved in the interaction with vimentin. The interaction of Vif with vimentin results in the partial or complete reorganization of vimentin and, in extreme cases, culminates in the perinuclear aggregation of vimentin and Vif. Vif-dependent collapse of vimentin is cell-cycle dependent and occurs during late S to G2 M phase. It is unclear at this time if and how the association of Vif with vimentin and the resulting changes in vimentin structure are correlated with the effect of Vif on vimentin. Studies involving Vif mutants are ongoing to investigate this problem. ',\n",
       " 'Chlamydia trachomatis serovars A-L3 are the causative agents of hyperendemic blinding trachoma, a largely neglected disease of the developing world, and sexually transmitted infections (STI) that are epidemic world wide. Control of these important human diseases is the long term goal of this project. Towards this end our goal is to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine to prevent these diseases. The obligate intracellular life style, complex developmental biology, and antigenic structure of chlamydiae have severally hindered progress in vaccine development. A major hurdle in chlamydial vaccine development has been the unavailability of antigens capable of providing broadly reactive protective immunity against the multiple serovariants (15) that cause oculogenital infections. The immediate goal of this work was to discover antigen(s) with characteristics amenable for the development of a broad based multi-strain vaccine against chlamydial infections and to test the candidates in pre-clinical models of infection and disease.',\n",
       " 'A hallmark of HIV infection is the recruitment of host factors involved in immune activation that help promote viral replication in various cellular compartments. HIV replication in CD4+ T cells, for example, is most efficient in the activated, memory subset. HIV antigen, in turn, activates HIV-specific cells and, indirectly, can activate non-specific T cells, thus creating a vicious cycle of immune activation and HIV replication. In addition, the chronic immune activation generated by persistent production of HIV antigen is thought to contribute to the immune dysfunction characteristic of HIV disease. This project is designed to further our understanding of the host factors and cellular subsets that influence HIV disease progression by modulating HIV-specific and non-specific immune activation. We are currently investigating the potential role of host-mediated immunosuppressive mechanisms, which are induced under conditions of persistent immune activation, in modulating HIV-specific immune responses. Our initial studies have focused on an immunosuppressive CD4+ T cell subset, CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in the context of HIV infection. We have demonstrated that CD25+ Treg cells isolated from the blood of HIV+ subjects inhibit HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune responses in vitro, particularly in individuals in the early stages of disease. HIV-specific immune responses suppressed by CD25+ Treg cells include proliferation, cytokine and chemokine secretion and the ability of CD8+ T cells to kill HIV expressing target cells. These detrimental effects of CD25+ Treg cells on virus-specific immune responses may be counter-balanced by the ability of these cells to suppress generalized, hyper-immune activation that may cause damage to the host and perpetuate HIV replication. In this regard, reduced CD25+ Treg function frequency in the peripheral blood of HIV+ individuals with progressive disease has been proposed as a contributing factor to hyper immune activation associated with untreated progressive HIV infection. However, we have recently demonstrated that functional CD25+ Treg cells, capable of suppressing HIV-specific T cell responses, are present in the lymphoid tissue of HIV+ subjects, including those with advanced disease (high VL and low CD4+ T cell counts). These data support phenotypic studies suggesting that CD25+ Treg cells migrate out of blood and into HIV antigen expressing tissue. Treg-mediated immunosuppression in lymphoid tissue may be particularly relevant as this is the primary site of adaptive immune response priming as well as a major site of HIV replication. We are further investigating, in collaboration with others, the role of CD25+ Treg cells in the control of hyper immune activation disease progression in the non-pathogenic SIV-infected sooty mangabey model. This model, which supports the concept that chronic immune activation is an important component of pathogenic HIV SIV infection, is characterized by a very weak SIV-specific T cell immune response, no significant CD4+ T cell loss, generalized hyper immune activation or disease despite significant levels of viremia. Finally, in vivo studies designed to deplete CD25+ cells (the Treg-containing population) in rhesus macaques in the context of SIV infection proved unfruitful due to ineffectiveness of the anti-CD25 immunotoxin used. We have also initiated studies investigating the role of Programmed Death (PD)-1 and its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) in the functional exhaustion of HIV-specific T cells. The interaction between PD-1 (primarily on activated T cells) and its ligands (on antigen presenting cells (APCs]) suppresses T cell activation; interference of this interaction has been shown to rescue exhausted CD8+ T cell responses in chronically LCMV-infected mice. Similar to chronic LCMV infection, chronic HIV infection is associated with anergy exhaustion of virus-specific T cells, a phenomenon that occurs relatively early in disease and is progressive in untreated HIV infection. We found that chronic HIV infection is associated with increased frequencies of PD-1+ T cells and PD-L1+ monocytes in both blood and lymphoid tissue. Treatment of PBMCs from HIV+ subjects with blocking anti-PD-L1 Ab significantly enhances HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferative responses in vitro. This enhancing effect is most pronounced in cells from HIV+ individuals with high PD-1 expression and weak negative baseline HIV-specific responses. These data suggest that HIV-specific immune responses, which are dramatically impaired in most chronically HIV-infected individuals, may be enhanced at least transiently by interfering with the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands in vivo.',\n",
       " 'The overall goal of the project has been to identify and characterize the function of macrophage products of potential importance in immune and inflammatory responses in order to manipulate these responses for clinical benefit. This laboratory identified mouse and human CXCL9 Mig and mouse CXCL10 Crg-2 IP-10, previously undescribed members of a family of small secreted proteins, termed chemokines. CXCL9 and CXCL10 are inducible in macrophage and other cells by IFN-gamma and target activated T cells, B cells and NK cells through the CXCR3 receptor, which they share with CXCL11 I-TAC, another interferon-inducible chemokine. Work in the last year has focused on understanding the roles of CXCR3 as well as another chemokine receptor, CCR4, on subsets of human lymphocytes. CXCR3 is found preferentially on T helper 1 cells and CCR4, the receptor for chemokines CCL17 and CCL22, is found preferentially on T helper 2 cells. We found that CXCR3 and CCR4 are expressed on a subsets of CD4+ (helper) T cells that are so early on the pathway of differentiation that they display no other markers typically ascribed to memory effector T cells. These CXCR3+ and CCR4+ early memory cells were able to produce cytokines typical of T helper 1 and T helper 2 cells, respectively. These data have implications for the pathways through which helper T cells are activated and differentiate to produce memory cells, which is important for protection against infection and effective vaccination. In addition, we have investigated roles for the chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL11 in HIV AIDS, related to the co-expression of CXCR3 and the major HIV coreceptor, CCR5, on CD4+ memory T cells. Our findings suggest that the recruitment of CCR5+ memory effector T cells by CXCR3 ligands to other infected cells and to lymph nodes may contribute to the dissemination of HIV infection. Our studies have used human cells and human tissues studied by flow cytometry with cell sorting, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, ELISA, and assays for receptor function including cell migration.',\n",
       " 'Among the insect-borne flaviviruses, the four dengue virus serotypes are most important in terms of human morbidity and geographic distribution. Several live-attenuated dengue vaccine formulations are currently in clinical trials. However, the safety of such dengue vaccines remains a concern. Passive immunization using monoclonal antibodies from humans or non-human primates represents an attractive alternative to a dengue vaccine. Repertoire cloning was performed to recover Fab antibody fragments from bone marrow mRNA of a chimpanzee infected with all four dengue virus serotypes. We have identified several Fab antibodies highly efficient for neutralization of dengue type 4 virus from a panel of Fabs recovered by repertoire cloning following panning with dengue type 4 virus. One of the neutralizing Fabs was selected to construct a full-length IgG1 antibody in combination with the human sequences. The humanized antibody produced in mammalian CHO cells proved to be highly neutralizing for dengue type 4 virus in vitro. In order to recover Fab antibodies against the other three dengue virus serotypes, repertoire cloning of the same phage library was also performed using dengue type 1, 2 and 3 viruses as panning antigens. Instead of a type-specific antibody, dengue virus-neutralizing Fabs that were cross-reactive with all dengue serotypes were identified. One of these Fabs also neutralized the West Nile virus among other flaviviruses tested. The humanized antibody derived from this Fab proved to be efficient for cross-neutralization of dengue type 1 and type 2 viruses. This antibody also cross-neutralized dengue type 3 and type 4 viruses and West Nile virus, but at a slightly reduced titer. Both the dengue type 4-specific and the cross-neutralizing, humanized monoclonal antibodies represent attractive candidates for further development of a passive immunization strategy against dengue and perhaps other flaviviruses-associated diseases. To gain an insight into the serological specificity and functional activity, we have also determined the epitope determinants of the chimpanzee Fab antibody, which had been shown to be broadly reactive to flaviviruses and efficient for neutralization of dengue type 1 and type 2 viruses. Analysis of dengue type 2 antigenic variants showed that a determinant critically involved in the Fab antibody binding and neutralization mapped to glycine at position 106 within the flavivirus-conserved fusion loop in the envelope glycoprotein. Another determinant affecting antibody neutralization, but not antibody binding, mapped to histidine at position 317 that is spatially closed to glycine-106 of the opposite homodimer of the dengue type 2 virus envelope protein. From the locations of these amino acids in the three-dimensional structure, the antibody appears to recognize a novel epitope on the envelope glycoprotein that has not been mapped before.',\n",
       " \"A crucial element in the development of effective prophylactic strategies for AIDS is an experimental animal model in which the course of immunodeficiency virus infection parallels the pathogenesis of the human disease. SIV infection of macaques is a relevant model. It induces an immunodeficiency syndrome in infected macaques that is remarkably similar to human AIDS. Therefore, candidate vaccines can be evaluated not only for their ability to prevent infection but also for their ability to prevent AIDS. The major vaccine effort within the laboratory has been an evaluation of the highly attenuated vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain as a recombinant vector. Three recombinant MVA viruses were generated that expressed either gag-pol alone, env alone, or a combination of gag-pol and env. A cohort of rhesus macaques were immunized to evaluate immunogenicity and protective efficacy after intravenous challenge. All macaques became infected following intravenous challenge with SIVsmE660. However, plasma viremia in each of the groups immunized with MVA-SIV recombinants was significantly reduced as compared to the group vaccinated with nonrecombinant MVA and survival was prolonged. These data demonstrate that vaccination with MVA-SIV recombinants results in significant protection from high viremia and AIDS. However, longterm followup demonstrated that the vast majority of these immunized macaques have progressed to AIDS. Evaluation of gag-specific CTL was performed in collaboration with Dr. Norman Letvin, utilizing macaques expressing the MamuA*01 MHC Class I haplotype. Four MamuA*01+ macaques were immunized with the MVA-gag-pol recombinant virus and an additional two macaques were immunized with MVA. Macaques immunized with MVA expressing gag-pol developed CD8+ CTL. Challenge of these macaques with SIVsmE660 resulted in a rapid and substantial anamnestic CTL response. Viral load set point was reduced in the macaques immunized with MVA-Gag-pol as compared to controls, however, the difference was not statistically significant. We evaluated the MVA strategy using a different challenge model, SHIV 89.6P infection of rhesus macaques. Four MamuA*01+ macaques were immmunized with MVA expressing SIVmac239 gag-pol and MVA expressing HIV 89.6 env. Following challenge with pathogenic SHIV 89.6P, a significant reduction in set point viremia and partial protection from CD4 lymphocyte depletion was observed when compared with animals immunized with MVA nonrecombinant. This degree of protection is only slightly less robust than that observed in macaques immunized with cytokine augmented DNA and DNA prime-MVA boosted macaques. This contrasts with the far less robust protection observed in macaques immunized with a comparable regimen following SIV challenge. During primary viremia in SHIV-infected macaques, massive elimination of CXCR4 anive CD4+ T cells occurred. In contrast, CCR5+ memory CD4+ T cells were selectivley depleted in rapidly progressing SIV-infected macaques. Thus SHIV and SIV target different subsets of CD4+ T cells. These differences explain the different pathogenesis of SIV and SHIV. Importantly, in the context of developing an effective vaccine, regimens that suppress SHIV might not protect monkeys against SIV or humans against HIV. In a collaborative study with Nancy Haigwood (SBRI), the role of passively transferred antibodies were studied in the SIV macaque model. Previous studies showed that postinfection passive treatment with polyclonal immune globulin with high neutralizing titers against SIVsmE660 (SIVIG) significantly improved the 67-week health of SIVsmE660-infected rhesus macaques. SIVIG treatment delayed the de novo production of envelope (Env)-specific antibodies by 8 weeks. Longterm follow-up of these animals showed that differences in disease progression were significant at 5 years postinfection. Macaques that maintained less than 1000 virus particles per ml of plasma had delayed disease onset. All macaques that survived beyond 18 months had measurable Gag-specific cytotoxic T cells, regardless of treatment. Humoral immunity in survivors beyond 20 weeks was strikingly different in the SIVIG and control groups. Despite a delay in Env-specific binding antibodies, de novo production of neutralizing antibodies was significantly accelerated in SIVIG-treated macaques. Titers of de novo neutralizing antibodies at week 12 were comparable to levels achieved in controls by week 32 or later. Acceleration of de novo simian immunodeficiency virus immunity in the presence of passively transferred neutralizing antibodies is a novel finding with implications for postexposure prophylaxis and vaccines. PHYLOGENY OF SIV HIV: The human immunodeficiency viruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2, are members of an extensive family of primate lentiviruses that appear to have their origins in African primates. Each of the human viruses presumably arose following cross-species transmission from a naturally-infected primate to humans. In the case of HIV-2, the precursor appears to be SIVsm from sooty mangabey monkeys (Cercocebus atys) whereas the origins of HIV-1 arose from SIVcpz from chimpanzees. The goal of this portion of the project is to molecularly characterize novel SIV isolates from wild-caught African monkeys more extensively. We initiated these studies by characterizing SIV isolates from three of the species of African green monkeys (vervets, grivets and tantalus), then SIV from Sykes monkeys and most recently SIV from lhoest monkeys (C. lhoesti). Studies in the Peeters' lab revealed that mandrills are infected with two distinct types of SIVs, one being the previously characterized virus now named SIVmnd-1 which is related to virus of the SIVlhoest species. The other appears to be a recombinant between SIVmnd-1 and SIV from drills (SIVdrl). Both SIVmnd-2 and SIVdrl have regions of homology with SIV from redcapped mangabeys (SIVrcm) but neither SIVrcm nor SIVdrl have been fully characterized. Recently we cloned and sequenced the entire genome of SIVrcm isolated from a wild caught redcapped mangabey from Nigeria and demonstrated that this virus is a complex recombinant. Comparison of SIVmnd-2 with SIVrcm revealed that SIVmnd-2 was a mosaic genome, highly related to SIVrcm in the 5' portion of the genome and to SIVmnd-1 in the 3' portion of the genome. Thus it appears that SIVrcm while in itself a recombinant is also the source of a portion of the SIVmnd-2 genome. These data are suggestive of cross-species transmission and recombination in the evolution of these viruses. We also characterized a SIVdrl and novel SIVmnd-type 2 isolate. These studies revealed that both of these viruses are recombinants between a SIVrcm-like virus and a SIVlhoest like virus and share a common recombination point. These data are consistent with a complex history of recombination and cross-species transmission involving SIV in drills, mandrills, redcapped mangabeys and L'hoest monkeys.\",\n",
       " 'Currently this project focusses on five key areas: (1) the chemical synthesis of derivatives of a natural product called thiolactomycin that targets an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall, (2) the chemical synthesis of analogs of nitroimidazoles such as PA-824, (3) the synthesis and evaluation of inhibitors of synthesis of the mycobacterial siderophore, Mycobactin, (4) the synthesis and evaluation of substrates for, and inhibitors of, transpeptidases that are responsible for remodeling the TB cell envelope, and (5) the synthesis of inhibitors of NAD synthetase. Project (1) targets mycolic acids which are complex alpha-branched, beta-hydroxy fatty acids that are unique to mycobacteria which are heavily modified by a variety of functional groups. Mycolic acids are biosynthetically produced through an extension of normal fatty acid metabolism. In mycobacteria this is initiated by a \"eukaryotic\"-like Type I fatty acid synthase, a large multifunctional enzyme that produces primarily short-chain (16-24 carbons) fatty acids that are then substrates for a second fatty acid synthase system that is more typically associated with bacteria. This Type II system appears to be the molecular target for isoniazid as well as other inhibitors such as triclosan. Thiolactomycin is a low molecular weight natural product isolated from a soil Nocardia species that specifically inhibits one component of the bacterial Type II fatty acid synthase system. Although it is a modest inhibitor against most bacteria it has shown in vivo activity in various experimental infections of animals. Studies this year, however, have uncovered some serious metabolic stability issues with the core thiolactone ring that have resulted in termination of this series of molecules. In Project (2) we are synthesizing analogs of nitroimiadazooxazines and nitroimidazooxazoles related to PA-824. PA-824 is currently in Phase II studies in humans for the treatment of tuberculosis. Working with scientists at the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, TBRS scientists have synthesized and characterized a large collection of analogs of these compounds and are advancing these through preclinical studies. Two candidate molecules were identified this year using computational methods (QSAR modeling) and were synthesized and found to be extremely potent (fourty fold better than PA-824) with improvements noted in solubility and toxicological profiling. These are currently in advanced preclinical testing and may advance to IND-enabling preclinical studies within the first quarter of 2009. In addition the enzyme responsible for activating these drugs has been conclusively identified and the mechanism of the drug class has been established. In this work we established the mechanism of action of PA-824 by synthesis of analogs and metabolites and in the process discovered an entire new family of enzymes and an entirely novel and unexpected chemical mechanism of drug action. These agents function as \"Trojan horses\" and intracellularly release Nitric oxide (NO) after activation by a bacterial enzyme. NO is a molecule intimately involved in natural human defense against tuberculosis and many other pathogens and this project suggests a new general paradigm for antibacterials development, as a result this work was just accepted for publication in Science. There are also immediate practical applications, in collaboration with scientists at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Foundation (GNF) who have reengineered this protein into a soluble form we hope to have preliminary crystals that diffract x-rays for structural work. We have synthesized the deazaflavin cofactor of this enzyme in mg quantities (a 14 step synthesis) for cocrystalization studies and hope to initiate structure-guided synthesis of analogs this year. In Project (3) we are evaluating approaches to the inhibition of the biosynthesis of the iron-acquiring siderophore of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobactin. In collaboration with scientists at the Unvieristy of Minnesota\\'s Center for Drug Design we are testing inhibitors of one of the earliest biosynthetic steps in this biosynthetic pathway. Targettinng iron acquisition builds upon a strong historical interest in TBRS in understanding the biosynthesis of this molecule which is required for bacterial growth during infection. we have designed and synthesized many analogs and several are being tested in animal models presently. In project (4) we are exploring the biological role of a unique family of L,D-transpeptidases that are thought to contribute to the inherent beta-lactam resistance of TB. By a combination of biochemical and chemical studies we have established the function of two of the five members of this family and we have synthesized a panel of inhibitors and substrates in the hopes of both elucidating the underlying biology enzymology as well as developing proof of concept molecules for a TB-specific family of penicillin-like compounds. Working with scientists at the Albert Einstein College of medicine who have solved the x-ray Crystal structure of the TB Beta lactamase in complex with clavulanic acid we have now also initiated a structure-guided program for designing better inhibitors. In project (5) we are working with the Gerratana laboratory who have solved the x-ray crystal structure of NadE which performs the last step of Nicotinamide biosynthesis to design and synthesize inhibitors of this enzyme. Both computation and structure-based approaches are being applies to elaborate fragments bound at the enzyme active site. In addition a high-throughput screening assay for this enzyme has been designed and implemented together with the NIH Chemical Genomics Center and will be run this year.',\n",
       " 'Lyme disease is a multisystem illness caused by infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and it is the leading vector-borne disease in the United States. Lyme disease is also common in Europe and also occurs in Russia, China and Japan. In humans, B. burgdorferi infection causes infection primarily in the skin, nervous system, heart and joints. Lyme disease can usually be treated successfully with antibiotic therapy, with the best results seen in patients with early disease. Unfortunately, some patients may not have a complete response to therapy. We currently have three clinical protocols studying patients with Lyme disease. Two protocols are natural history studies and serve as the basis for multiple lines of investigation. One protocols addresses patients with post treatment Lyme disease syndrome. The other protocol allow for the study of patients with classical Lyme disease. A third protocol will examine the host reponse in skin biopsies from patients with erythema migrans lesions using microarrays. Our work addresses 3 areas in Lyme disease: laboratory diagnosis, clinical manifestations and immunological responses to B. burgdorferi. We also have a protocol to investigate the cause of Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI), in collaboration with the CDC. STARI is a rash similar to the rash of Lyme disease that occurs in persons residing in southeastern and south-central states and is associated with the bite of the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum.',\n",
       " 'A. TGF-beta related proteins. We have crystallized a TGF-beta1 complex with a neutralizing antibody 1D11.16 in order to delineate the surface loops of TGF-beta1 that mediate the receptor binding. The best crystals are grown in the presence of 8 - 10% PEG 8000, 20% glycerol, 0.2 M sodium acetate and 0.1 M sodium citrate at pH 5.6. A typical crystal measures 0.1 x0.1 x0.3 mm in size and it diffracts to about 2.9 angstroms resolution. Using SDS gel electrophoresis, we have shown the presence of both TGF-beta1 and 1D11.16 in this crystal form. We have also crystallized a complex of TGF-beta and its type II receptor. The existance of the complex has been demonstrated by SDS gel electrophoresis. Currently, the size of these crystals are still small and further improvement in crystallization condition is needed to obtain data collection quality crystals. B. Immunoglobulin Fc receptors. A method has been developed in this laboratory to over express soluble Fc receptors of human FcgammaRII, FcgammaRIII and a mouse FcgammaRII. Cells are cultured on the surface of cytodex 2 beads as microcarriers. A three step scale-up protocal is implemented in order to obtain milligram quantity of proteins. C. Molybdopterin containing formate dehydrogenase H from E. coli. Due to the extreme oxygen sensitivity of FDH, the enzyme was purified and crystallized under anaerobic conditions. Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies wer e obtained in a space group P4 12 12 with cell dimensions a=b=146.2 angstroms, c=83.2 angstroms. We have developed a cryofreezing protocol for the FDH data collection to avoid oxidation of the enzyme. The native and a number of heavy atom derivative screening data sets have been collected using our lab source x-ray facilities. Among the potential heavy atom derivatives, we solved a major binding site of K2PtCl 4 by inspecting its difference Patterson map and other derivatives by cross Fourier method. A set of multiple wavelength diffraction data were collected using Brookhaven synchrotron facility for phase determinations. D. Blood-type converting enzymes. We have crystallized two blood-type converting enzymes, an alpha-galactosidase (alpha-Gal) which converts A- to O-type blood and an alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGal) that converts B- to O-typeblood. Crystals of `-NAGal grow to a size of 0.85mm x 0.28mm x 0.22mm from a solution containing 1.5M ammonium sulfate or lithium sulfate and 0.1 M sodium acetate at pH 5.6. They diffract to 2.8 angstroms and belong to the spae group P4 12 12 with unit cell dimensions of a=b-72.1 angstroms, c=176.3 angstroms (alpha=beta=gamma=90 degrees). Native and a number of heavy atom derivative data sets have been collected under cyrofreezing conditions both in our lab and in NSLS for MIR and anomalous phase determination. ',\n",
       " 'Allergic diseases, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and eosinophilic gastroenteritis, are inflammatory diseases of the mucosa. After allergen exposure, IgE bearing cells, such as mast cells and basophils, are first activated. Later, T lymphocytes enter the mucosa, are activated by allergen and play a key role in regulating this inflammatory response through the elaboration of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-gamma. This project seeks to examine the cytokine and mediator profiles of mast cell, basophil and T cell subpopulations that may be involved in the generation of inflammation in allergic diseases. We have developed sensitive intracellular cytokine assays to measure allergen specific T cell cytokine responses with a fidelity heretofore not possible. Using these methods, we have shown that allergen specific T cells are predominantly of the classic Th2 phenotype, and that on the single cell level IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 are highly co-expressed. Furthermore, heterogeneity of these cytokine producing Th2 cells has been, suggesting the possibility that specific diseases entities or inflammatory processes are the result of preferential differentiation of distinct cytokine producing Th2 cells. Specific subsets of allergen specific memory T cells have be identified and investigations into the factors promoting and inhibiting these subsets are being made. A thorough understanding of the biology of these pro-allergic inflammatory T cells is needed as a step in the development of therapeutic approaches to blocking the differentiation and function of these cells. Additionally, we have extended our previous work with IgE receptor (FceRI) bearing antigen presenting cells and have identified a subset of monocytes that express FceRI. FceRI expression by this subset correlated to serum IgE concentration and was reduced by therapeutic administration of anti-IgE. These results further define the role of FceRI and IgE in antigen presentation, and suggest that via this mechanism, anti-IgE therpeutics may have an effect on allergen specific T cell activation.',\n",
       " '1) Herpesviruses cause latent infections that persist for the lifetime of the host and these viruses have developed mechanisms to counteract host defenses so as to allow the virus to persist. Using sophisticated computer programs we are identi-fying herpesvirus genes that may have cellular homologs. These genes are being expressed in various systems to determine how the genes may interact with host cell proteins, including those of the immune system, to influence the course of infec- tion. Identification of these genes may help define new targets for antiviral therapy or new insights into modulating the immune system. 2) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes a type II membrane protein, BZLF2, that is homologous to members of the C-type lectin family. In collaboration with Immunex Corporation, we have constructed a soluble fusion protein containing the human IgG Fc domain linked to the extracellular domain of BZLF2. The extracellular domain of BZLF2 was found to bind to the human MHC class II HLA-DR beta chain. Site directed mutagenesis of the HLA-DR beta chain indicated that the beta1 domain was required for recognition of the extracellular domain of BZLF2. Since this domain participates in forming the peptide binding pocket, these results suggested that BZLF2 may interfere with class II directed antigen presentation. The fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of BZLF2 inhibited antigen presentation and generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte cultures. Current studies are directed toward inactivating the BZLF2 gene in EBV to determine the role of the protein during growth of the virus both in cell culture and in an animal model. 3) Vari-cella-zoster virus (VZV) ORF13 encodes the viral thymidylate synthetase. This protein has 68% amino acid identity to the human thymidylate synthetase. We have constructed a mutant in the Oka vaccine strain of VZV that cannot express the viral thymidylate synthetase by inserting stop codons into the gene. We plan to inocu-late guinea pigs with the VZV mutant to determine whether viral thymidylate synthe-tase is important for infection with the virus or for the ability to spread to the central nervous system and maintain latent infection. 4) Additional herpesvirus homologs of known mammalian proteins have been identified. Promising candidates will be studied in appropriate systems in collaboration with M. Spriggs at Immunex Corporation. ',\n",
       " 'The initiation of the herpes simplex virus lytic replication cycle depends upon the coordinated expression of the viral (IE) immediate early genes. These genes are controlled by a complex multiprotein enhancer assembly that consists of viral and cellular components. Studies of the various components, protein interactions, viral and cellular functions provides both a model for cellular transcriptional regulation as well as insights into the mechanisms utilized by the virus. The focus of the laboratory is the identification and characterization of the critical components of this regulatory pathway. The mammalian coactivator HCF-1 is one of the more complex factors involved in both the assembly of the enhancer complex and the activation of the IE genes. Studies focus upon both functions during the viral lytic cycle as well as in normal cellular processes. The importance of both is underscored by the complex viral-cell interactions that impact the lytic and latent states of the viral life cycle. These studies (i) have delineated functional domains of the protein; (ii) identified cellular and viral proteins that interact with various domains; (iii) elucidated a role for HCF-1 in the regulation of HSV DNA replication; (iv) characterized a unique mechanism for the regulation of protein-protein interactions via site-specific proteolytic processing; (iv) identified HCF-1 as the essential component of both HSV and VZV viral IE gene expression; and (v) identified cellular genes regulated by HCF-1 using a genetic system that specifically sequesters the factor.',\n",
       " 'Once an individual is infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV), the virus establishes a latent infection in sensory neurons. Periodically, various stimuli may induce lytic reactivation resulting in mild recurrent lesions to more severe disease. The factors which determine the establishment of latency and reactivation are poorly understood. However, considering the requirements for the viral IE gene products in productive infection, it is likely that the regulation of this latency reaction cycle is dependent upon the components which regulate the expression of the IE genes. The critical component of this regulatory process is HCF-1. Analyses of this protein in a mouse model have shown that the protein is specifically sequestered in the cytoplasm of sensory neurons and rapidly transported to the nucleus in response to reativation stimuli. Additional studies have determined (i) transport of the factor is directly correlated with neurons undergoing viral reactivation; and (ii) distinct reactivation stimuli result in transport. Studies which focus on another component involved in the regulation of the IE genes (Oct-1) have indicated that this protein, in contrast to the accepted model, is not required for the induced expression of the IE genes. This suggests that there are alternative regulatory mechanisms mediated by other components that can play a significant role in the induction of the IE genes. The data has led to the model that distinct reactivation stimuli may result in different induction mechanisms that may be mediated by the common critical component HCF-1.',\n",
       " 'Papillomavirus infection is widespread and induce persistent epithelial lesions, known as papillomas and genital and associated with the development of cervical cancer. Our laboratory has established that papillomavirus genomes and the E2 transactivator protein interact with cellular mitotic chromosomes in dividing cells. This ensures that viral genomes are properly segregated to daughter cells and are retained within the nucleus. Our aim is to elucidate the mechanisms by which the E2 proteins control the viral life cycle. We have shown that the dimerization function of the E2 protein is required for efficient Brd4 binding in vitro and efficient chromosomal asociation in vivo. We have further characterized cellular proteins that form complexes with the E2 proteins from multiple papillomaviruses. We have further characterized chromatin binding sites for the E2-Brd4 complex on human chromosomes in interphase and mitotic cells.',\n",
       " 'Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a human poxvirus that causes asymptomatic cutaneous neoplasms that can persist for months to years in the skin of healthy or immunodeficient individuals, particularly children. Persistent infections with this virus are increasing and have become troublesome complications for adults with AIDS. At present there is no specific preventive or treatment for the disease. All attempts to culture the virus have failed and little is known about it. The objectives of the project are to analyze the structure of the viral genome, identify its genes, determine its mode of expression and replication, and find potential therapeutic targets. The way the virus resists the human immune system is of particular interest. The entire 190,000 base pair genome of MCV type I, except for terminal loops, has been sequenced. An analysis revealed that MCV encodes approximately 182 proteins, 105 of which have direct counterparts in vaccinia or smallpox virus. The latter include all genes known to be essential for replication of vaccinia virus. The unique genes include some that appear to antagonize host defenses by blocking inflammation, antigen presentation, and apoptosis. ',\n",
       " \"Based on our work on the mechanism of T lymphocyte or programmed cell death or apoptosis, we have studied autoimmune diseases in two areas: 1) pathogenesis and 2) treatment. We have determined the molecular pathogenesis of one form of autoimmunity by studying a group of children that had been followed by Drs. Stephen Straus and Warren Strober in the LCI, NIAID. These children exhibit an autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) consisting of massive nonmalignant lymphadenopathy, autoimmune phenomena and expanded populations of CD3+, CD4-, CD8- lymphocytes together with antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders. We found that several ALPS children have deleterious mutations in the apoptosis-inducing molecule Fas that lead to defective Fas-mediated T lymphocyte apoptosis. Family studies showed that the mutations were inherited and thus defined the molecular basis of a genetic autoimmune disorder. One family reveals the co-occurrence of ALPS, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and a Fas mutation. We have also detected three families that have defective apoptosis with normal Fas indicating that ALPs may involves mutations in other genes in the apoptosis pathway. In attempting to use T cell apoptosis to treat autoimmune diseases, we are testing tolerance due to antigen-induced apoptosis as a new modality of immune therapy. A CRADA has been established to test whether T cell apoptosis can be predictably induced by antigen in various animal models of autoimmune disease and graft rejection. The ultimate purpose of these investigations is to advance apoptosis therapy for T cell-mediated diseases to a clinical trial. A primary goal of the CRADA at present is to establish whether the administration of myelin antigens as an antigen-specific therapy can alleviate multiple sclerosis (MS). In preparation for a clinical trial, we have accomplished several things: 1) building and testing recombinant versions of myelin protein antigens; 2) establishing a non-human primate model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). This model has proven to very faithfully reproduce the clinical phenotype as well as central nervous system pathology characteristic of MS. This large animal model also allows magnetic resonance imaging which is not possible for rodent EAE.; 3) refining means to test for the elimination of myelin-reactive T cells in peripheral blood. In addition to MS, we have begun work on transgenic mouse models for myasthenia gravis and autoimmune uveitis. \",\n",
       " 'In this project we are taking a multifaceted approach to studying molecular basis of programmed cell death in lymphocytes. Our attack is based on the hypothesis that there are principally two mechanisms of programmed death of T cells: i) lymphokine deprivation death (LDD) and ii) propriocidal death (PD) due to antigen stimulation of activated T cells. With regard to LDD, we are trying to understand how withdrawal of a trophic stimulus, IL-2 in the case of T cells, can initiate the death program. We have found that lymphokine withdrawal leads to the activation of the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and we conjecture that this leads to a gene activation event that initiates the death program. In studying PD, we have focused on the activation of a protease termed Flice Mach1 (caspase 8) which can directly carry out the death program. ',\n",
       " 'Intracellular signaling plays a crucial role in lymphocyte development and function. Although a large number of signaling molecules have identified, it remains to be elucidated how the activation of an individual signaling molecule contributes to various in vivo physiological phenomena such as control of antigen receptor gene rearrangement, repertoire selection, tolerance induction, peripheral lymphocyte activation and maintenance of immune memory. Since these questions can only be properly addressed in different in vivo systems, this project focuses on developing animal models using gene targeting and transgenic approaches, and then using various cellular, molecular and biochemical methods to analyze the impact of various altered signaling pathway on the development, function and pathology of lymphocytes in vivo. We are currently interested in understanding the regulatory functions of the protein tyrosine kinases such as Ctk, as well as the so called adaptor signaling molecules including Grb2 and c-cbl. For this reason, we have established several animal models in which these molecules are inactivated either in the germline or potentially at different stages of animal development. So far, Ctk- -, c-cbl- -, Grb2- + and Grb2floxed mice have been obtained in our laboratory. These model systems may allow us to study in detail intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in lymphocyte development and function in a more physiological situation. ',\n",
       " 'The NF-kappaB transcription factor family and the family of IkappaB proteins which regulate the function of these transcription factors are both critical for the defense of the organism: they control the expression of many immunomodulatory proteins as well as proteins which counteract stress. These proteins also regulate the expression of HIV. The overall NF-kappaB and IkappaB activity in a given cell is a result of the expression and activity of the individual family members in that cell. An understanding of the unique functions of the various family members may offer highly specific and limited targets for immunomodulatory therapies. We have initiated a study to dissect the roles of individual members of these two families by generating so-called \"knock-out\" mice which lack expression of either p52, a subunit of NF-kappaB, or Bcl-3, an IkappaB family member whose physiologic role is largely unknown. To understand the roles of these proteins during immune responses, we challenged these mice with viruses and pathogens. We have demonstrated impaired immune responses in both of these knock-out strains. In the Bcl-3 deficient mice, both antibody responses to influenza and B-cell independent responses to parasites are significantly reduced. We have also generated p50 p52 double knock-out mice; these mice die within several weeks of birth with multiple immune defects. Since the p52 and Bcl-3 genes have been found as partners in recurrent chromosomal translocations in certain B- and T-cell tumors, our studies will be essential to understand the role these proteins can play during tumorigenesis. Individual functions of the NF-kappaB complexes are also being investigated in the context of a given promoter. We discovered that some of the NF-kappaB transcription factors may exert their influence well beyond those genes which harbor known kappaB binding sites in their regulatory regions; the NF-kappaB subunits p65 and c-Rel can interact with the serum response factor (SRF) and thereby strongly and positively affect transcriptional activation through the SRF binding element (SRE) present in the regulatory regions of many inducible genes. ',\n",
       " 'The research project concerns the mechanism by which the IkappaB-alpha inhibitor becomes inactivated during stimulation of immune cells which in turn leads to activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. NF- kappaB is critical for the induced expression of many genes whose encoded functions are required to counteract pathogens or stress. In addition, NF-kappaB regulates the expression of several viruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Therefore, blocking the activation of NF-kappaB could aid in the treatment of many inflammatory diseases and may also prevent the spread of HIV. An understanding of the mechanism(s) of activation of this transcription factor and the identification of the molecular components involved will provide potential targets for anti-inflammatory and anti-viral therapies. We have previously demonstrated that activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor involves rapid phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of its cytoplasmic inhibitor IkappaB-alpha. We discovered that the phosphorylation of this inhibitor in response to cellular stimulation is not sufficient to activate the transcription factor, but that induced proteolytic degradation is necessary. Specifically we found that calpain inhibitors will block activation of the transcription factor by blocking the proteasome-mediated degradation of IkappaB-alpha, while having no effect on its induced phosphorylation. We determined the precise amino acid sites at which the inhibitor becomes phosphorylated in response to signals, and we showed that phosphorylation of these sites is required for proteolytic degradation and thus for activation of NF- kappaB. These results will aid in the identification of the molecular component(s) which targets the phosphorylated inhibitor for proteasomal degradation and the kinase(s) which phosphorylates in response to appropriate stimuli.

       " 'The goal of the project is to investigate the biological roles of members of the chemokine family of cytokines by studying chemokine actions in vivo, primarily in animal models of infectious disease. This laboratory discovered two mouse chemokines, Crg-2 and Mig. Crg-2 is the mouse homologue of the human chemokine IP-10, and the murine Mig (MuMig) was used to identify a human homologue, HuMig. Crg-2 IP-10 and Mig are related interferon-gamma inducible chemokines that preferentially target T lymphocytes, acting as chemotactic factors for activated T cells. It is our hypothesis that these chemokines are important for recruiting T cells to sites of inflammation and immune response. Infections of mice with intracellular pathogens, including malaria, Toxoplasma gondii and vaccinia virus, led to widespread induction of mig and crg-2. We demonstrated that inductions of mig by infection with T. gondii and vaccinia virus were dependent absolutely on interferon gamma expression patterns of mig and crg-2 IP-10 differed. In each model the highest level of expression of mig was in the liver while crg-2 was expressed at the highest level in different tissues concordant with the local expression of interferon-gamma. These finding suggest that the actions of Mig may extend beyond local sites of inflammation. We analyzed expression of 16 mouse chemokines in granulomatous inflammation using eggs of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni in a sensitization and challenge protocol where responses were manipulated by co-administration of IL-12 during sensitization. We found significant differences in chemokine gene expression in the lungs of mice challenged with eggs of S. mansoni following sensitization in the presence of italis-12 as compared to sensitization without IL-12. Following sensitization in the presence of IL-12, mig and crg-2 were the most highly induced chemokine genes, suggesting that these chemokines might have a role in the anelioration of granulomatous pathology seen in these mice. In order to evaluate the roles of mig and crg-2 IP-10 in host defence we have produced recombinant vaccinia virus producing these chemokines, neutralizing antibodies, and mice with targeted deletion disruption of the mig gene and studies using these biological reagents are underway.

These Phase 1 trials are underway in the USA and in an endemic population in Mali in collaboration with the University of Bamako, Mali.

       " 'Advances in ALPS: 1.) Some cases of SHML (Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, aka Rosai-Dorfman syndrome) may represent ALPS. Similar to ALPS, SHML is a rare disorder that usually presents in childhood. SHML is a proliferative histiocytic disorder of unknown cause. As part of the tissue evaluation of ALPS patients, the histologic observation of SHML was made, suggestive of the possibility of an association between ALPS and SHML. All available reactive lymph node materials from 44 ALPS Type Ia patients were evaluated for features of SHML: 41% (18 of 44 patients) had one or more lymph nodes that fulfilled the criteria for SHML as assessed on hematoxylin and eosin sections and confirmed by S-100 immunostaining. Representative cases of SHML were also evaluated. The results suggest that some cases of SHML may represent ALPS 2.) Somatic Fas mutations: In 2004, ALPS investigators from Europe reported 6 patients with somatic Fas mutations limited to their CD3+CD4-CD8-TCR+ T cells (DNTs\") population, a cell population with a known survival advantage, thus providing new insights into causation in a subset of patients with ALPS. Based upon their findings, we evaluated 20 patients from our cohort with unidentified mutations for the presence of somatic Fas mutations (12 ALPS Type IIIs and 8 with ALPS phenotype): 1 of 12 (8 %) and 3 of 8 (38 %) patients were positive for somatic mutations, respectively. These results provide evidence that patients classified as either ALPS phenotype or ALPS Type III with atypical late onset of ALPS presenting features would benefit from screening for the presence of a Fas mutations in their peripheral blood DNT population. Further research to characterize this patient subset at the molecular and clinical level, along with associated risks and outcomes are continuing aims of investigation. 3.) Provided is the classification scheme that we have devised for ALPS patients based on the site of their mutation: Type Ia: mutations in the TNFRSF6 gene, encodes Fas. Type Ia, somatic mutant: TNFRSF6 defect in the DNT population Type Ib: mutations in the TNFSF6 gene, encodes for Fas ligand. Type IIa: mutations in CASP10 gene, encodes Caspase-10. Type IIb: mutations in the CASP8 gene, encodes Caspase 8. Type III: associated mutation unidentified to date. 4.) Evidence that a caspase-10 alteration (mutation), V410I, demonstrates a protective effect against severe disease when present together with dominant Fas mutations in members of ALPS Type Ia kindreds. 5.) The human lymphocyte antigen, HLA B44, appears to confer a protective role against disease severity. We evaluated HLA as a potential candidate modifier locus. Analysis included HLA A, B (including subtypes) and DQB alleles in 356 individuals from 63 unrelated families with defined TNFRSF6 mutations associated with ALPS. The transmission of HLA B44 was significantly overrepresented (P value: <0.0074) in healthier mutation-bearing individuals as compared to transmission in patients with severe clinical features of ALPS, suggesting a protective role in ALPS. The numbers were too small to determine whether the association is caused by the B44 allele or an allele at some other nearby locus. 6.) Availability of a disease severity score for investigators. We have developed and validated a quantitative severity score rating system including both clinical and laboratory metrics to assist in analysis and disease severity scoring. Feedback is welcome. 7.) Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) confers therapeutic benefit to ALPS patients with difficult to control cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia). Background of ALPS: In 1990, we identified and began to characterize a new chronic disorder we have termed autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, or ALPS. It manifests as chronic nonmalignant adenopathy and splenomegaly; the expansion of an unusual population of CD4-CD8-T cells (DNTs); and the development of autoimmune disease including but not limited to hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Through our family-based association studies, we learned to identify and diagnose the syndrome and to identify and treat most of its major complications effectively. We have documented a variety of humoral and cellular immunologic abnormalities in ALPS patients, including circulation of multiple autoantibodies leading to immune cytopenias, alterations in lymphocyte subsets and disordered regulation of cytokines. In vitro studies with human cells and cell lines showed that ALPS is associated with inherited defects in genes involving lymphocyte apoptosis pathways. Inherited mutations in genes that regulate cell death, a process referred to as apoptosis, is causal in the development of ALPS and related disease. Mutations in more than four genes associated with ALPS have been identified to date. Most cases of ALPS (over 70 percent) are classified as Type Ia, these involve functional heterozygous mutations in the APT1 gene, which encodes Fas (CD95, APO-1, TNFRSF6-Tumor necrosis Factor Receptor SuperFamily-6), a lymphocyte surface protein; Type Ib is associated with mutations in Fas ligand, Type IIa with caspase-10 and Type IIb with caspase-8. Patients for whom the involved apoptotic gene has yet to be identified are classified as Type III. We have determined that inherited mutations in Fas represent a novel risk factor for the subsequent development of B and T cell lymphomas. The risk of non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas compared to that of the general population, matched by age, are 14 and 51 fold elevated, respectively. This represents a challenge that we are addressing by defining an algorithm for patient follow up and lymphoma detection under a protocol in which PET scanning is being evaluated for its ability to discriminate ALPS nodes from lymphomatous nodes. Our hope over time will be to determine whether PET scanning helps us identify ALPS patients who are in transition of lymphoma or at risk for doing so. We are testing agents that stimulate lymphocyte apoptosis in MRL lpr mice bearing homozygous deletions of the Fas gene. We plan to undertake sequential pilot studies of treatments derived from the LPR mouse model and implemented in Phase I-II studies among ALPS patients. We will test their capacity to reduce adenopathy and splenomegaly, and to lessen immunoglobulin, autoantibody and IL-10 levels. In addition, we continue to evaluate the role of immunomodulating agents in the prevention of splenectomy for the treatment of hypersplenism.',\n",
       " 'Infection by enveloped viruses is initiated by binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein(s) to specfic receptor molecules on the target cell, followed by fusion between the viral and cellular membranes. For the morbilliviruses measles virus (MV), and canine distemper virus (CDV), fusion requires co-expression of the virus fusion (F) and hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins on the surface of one cell, as well as the presence of the appropriate receptors on the other cell. In previous work, we showed that fusion occurs efficiently with heterologous expression of F from one virus and H from the other; cell-type specificity is determined by H. We also obtained direct evidence for functional and structural interaction between measles H and CD46, the known MV receptor. ',\n",
       " 'This research project encompasses a number of different approaches to both understand how current antitubercular chemotherapy works using the most modern technologies and to use this information to develop new and improved therapies and therapeutic approaches. Individual projects within this framework are aimed at; (1) understanding the biochemical mode of action of existing front-line antituberculars such as isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, (2) understanding the action of various agents in animal models of tuberculosis therapy, and (3) understanding the development of resistance within patients undergoing chemotherapy. The project relies on the development of advanced animal models for predicting drug efficacy under real world conditions. In addition, development of screening assays that would predict drugs able to shorten the current duration of therapy or treat latent infections have been a large focus. Section scientists have also been involved in understanding the mechanism of action of second-line antituberculars and the evolution of multidrug resistance in patients in South Korea and Cambodia. A Natural History clinical research protocol is in the final stages of IRB approval, an IRB has been constituted in South Korea, and GCP training of staff at the clinical research site in South Korea has been completed. In addition, a Phase I clinical trial of pimonidazole, a marker of hypoxic tissues, has been initiated in South Korea and is in the final stages of IRB approval and registration with the Korean FDA.',\n",
       " 'A fundamental property of differentiated cells is that they utilize a unique combination of gene products, some that are ubiquitously expressed and others that are cell type specific. We have identified several lineage restricting elements in the promoter regions of the CD19 and CD20 genes that help to confer B-lymphocyte specific expression, as well as several elements that bind ubiquitously expressed transcription factors. One key regulatory element binds the B-cell specific activator protein (BSAP). The development of antibodies against BSAP allowed the identification of a BSAP variant of smaller molecular mass that has an alternative COOH terminus. This product is expressed in pre-B cell lines, localizes in the cytoplasm, and shifts to the nucleus following activation. We have also found that BSAP is regulated during B-cell differentiation within the germinal center regions of lymph nodes and we have established a set of BSAP transgenic mice to examine the consequences of forced over-expression of BSAP in B cells. We have also found that BSAP is markedly over-expressed in certain high grade B-cell lymphomas. To evaluate the mechanisms regulating BSAP gene transcription in normal B cells and B-cell lymphomas, we isolated the BSAP promoter region and identified several in vivo footprinted regions in the promoter. However, promoter-constructs have not behaved as expected suggesting the presence of a potent negative regulatory element. Another approach to analyze the role of transcription factors in vivo is to create mice deficient in a specific transcription factor (\"knock-out\" mice). HB9 is a homeobox gene present at high levels in a subset of B cells in humans. We have targeted the HB9 gene in mice. The HB9 + - mice are apparently normal, however, the HB9 - - mice die at birth perhaps because of a problem with motor neuron development. Analysis of hematopoiesis in these mice is in progress. Overall, these studies are leading to a better understanding of the complex interplay between transcription factors and their target sequences in generating lineage specific gene expression. ',\n",
       " 'Heterotrimeric G proteins are signal transducers for many hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, and chemotactic factors. We have discovered a family of proteins termed RGSs that impairs signal transduction through pathways that utilize heterotrimeric G proteins. There are at least 16 members of the RGS family and they are expressed in a wide variety of cell types. Some are tissue specific while others are broadly expressed. These proteins are highly conserved evolutionarily as they are the functional and structural homologs of the yeast protein Sst2p. Introduction of the mammalian proteins into yeast can impair signal transduction through a G protein linked pathway in yeast in a manner analogous to Sst2p. Epistatic studies in yeast indicate that the RGS family members require the Galpha subunit in order to function. We have isolated complete cDNAs for three family members and partial sequences for three other members. Besides impairing G protein signaling in yeast the introduction of RGS family members into mammalian cells also impairs signaling through G protein coupled receptors. In addition, signaling through G protein coupled receptors can be a strong inductive signal for RGS production suggesting that these proteins can function in a feedback mechanism to limit signal transduction through these receptors. We have produced recombinant RGS1, RGS3, and RGS4 for protein interaction studies and for the development of specific antisera. Large scale production of RGS1 for structural studies is in progress. The RGS family members specifically interact with the Galpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein and they interfere with the exchange of GDP for GTP. Individual RGS family members may interact with several different Galpha subunits although they do so with varying affinities. Transgenic mice that over express RGS1 in B lymphocytes have been developed and are currently being analyzed. Mouse genomic clones have been isolated for three RGS family members and gene targeting experiments are in progress to assess the physiologic roles of these genes. Our current thinking is that these proteins modulate and fine tune G protein signaling and individual RGS members may modulate a specific G protein or class of G proteins. As such the RGSs offer potential targets for drug development. ',\n",
       " 'Cell type-specific signal transducers provide potential targets for either interrupting or enhancing function of specific cell subsets. CD22 is a B lineage specific membrane protein that mediates cell-cell interactions via a sialic acid dependent mechanism; within its intracellular domain it contains several motifs that can activate signaling pathways. The tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk the lipid kinase PI-3 kinase the serine threonine kinases Erk1 and Erk2 and the phosphastase SHP1 all associate with CD22 either prior to or following CD22 cross linking. Syk specifically phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the intracellular portion of CD22 allowing other proteins to associate with CD22. CD22 cross linking leads to activation of the mitogen activated Protein (MAP) and stress activated protein (SAP) kinase pathways resulting in activation of AP-1. The physiologic role of CD22 in B cell immune function is being addressed by gene targeting and the generation of CD22 transgenic mice. Two interesting kinases found in B cells GCK1 and GCK2, specifically activate the SAP kinase pathway. The two proteins have very similar catalytic domains, but they have significantly different carboxyl terminal regulatory domains. While both proteins activate the SAP kinase pathway, GCK1 is superior to GCK2. Both proteins require SEK1 to activate this pathway. In contrast to the SAP kinase pathway, GCK2 failed to activate the related MAP kinase pathway and, in fact, they specifically inhibit its activation indicating that their activation biases the cell toward the SAP kinase pathway. Both GCK1 and GCK2 phosphorylate proline rich substrates and they both efficiently phosphorylate myelin basic protein. We have recently shown that the betagamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins significantly increase the activity of GCK2. Another very potent activator of GCK2 is oncogenic Ras. Alterations of Ras are commonly found in human tumors. Over expression of a constitutively active Ras dramatically increases the catalytic activity of GCK2. Thus, GCK2 may serve to link Ras to the SAP kinase pathway and to mediate signals generated through signaling pathways that activate Ras. ',\n",
       " 'Although there is much interest in Cryptococcal research, tools for the genetic analysis in C. neoformans are less well developed than in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Since genomic sequencing of C. neoformans has been completed, functional genomics can now be accomplished on a large scale by the forward genetics approach. In order to effectively identify the genes disrupted randomly and to elucidate their functions, a tagging system for the deletion constructs will be needed. There are several tagging systems that have been successfully used in bacteria as well as in fungi which include the transposon or the signature tagging methods (STM). These methods have been less than successful for use in C. neoformans due to the lack of a controlable transposon in C. neoformans as well as the lack of randomness in the STM system. In 2003,we developed the Agrobacterium mediated transformation system (ATMT) in a serotype D strain of C. neoformans. This method was superior to either the electroprative or the biolistic transformation method with respect to both the transformation frequency and the rate of single copy random insertions of the tagged sequence into the geneome. During 2004-2005, we applied the ATMT method to all four serotypes of C. neoformans and studied the effect of pyrimidine or purine starvation on the transformation efficacy. Unlike in Saccharomyces cereviciae where adenine mutants transform at a significantly higher rate by ATMT, adenine or uracil auxotophs of C. neoformans did not show any increases in transformation frequency by ATMT. Although the transformation frequencies were higher in pyrimidine auxotrophs of certain strains which indicated that such increases may be strain dependent. During 2005-2006, we have screened 30,000 insertional mutant clones for various identifyable phenotypes such as growth under low oxygen, capsule formation etc.',\n",
       " \"Ongoing studies in this project concern the basic cell biology, biochemistry and molecular biology of Leishmania, a group of protozoan pathogens of humans. All Leishmania parasites undergo a cyclic developmental cycle: 1) in mammals, they transform into and multiply as obligate intracellular [amastigote] forms within the phago-lysosomal system of host macrophages and 2) in their hematophagous sandfly-vector hosts, they differentiate into, and multiply as, extracellular [promastigote] forms within the insect's alimentary tract. Various species of this organism cause over 12 million cases of human disease worldwide. In infected humans, these parasites destroy macrophages within the skin or internal organs (spleen, liver and bone marrow) causing either disfiguring ulcerative cutaneous lesions (e.g., caused by L. mexicana) or degenerative and fatal visceral disease (e.g., caused by L. donovani). Previous studies from our laboratory have established that Leishmania parasites are apically polarized secretory cells and that they constitutively secrete over 40 different soluble protein, glycoprotein and carbohydrate constituents into their growth media in vitro. Such soluble, extracellularly secreted products can readily diffuse away from these parasites and permeate their environments. In nature, these organisms reside and multiply within various aqueous micro environments in their several hosts. Since these organisms actively secrete a variety of different enzymes that could alter such host micro- environments, an understanding of the nature of these parasite enzymes seems essential. To that end, several parasite secretory enzymes are investigated toward defining their functional roles in the survival, maintenance, growth and transmission of these organisms. Further, genes encoding these proteins are being identified and characterized toward defining their expression and regulation during parasite growth, development and differentiation. Experiments involving both the in situ deletion and over-expression of such genes should demonstrate whether their encoded proteins are, in fact, essential to this parasite's survival. \",\n",
       " 'Mast cells (MCs) and T lymphocytes are two cell types integral to development of an allergic response and asthma. The signature response of each of these cells, degranulation and cytokine production, respectively, is induced primarily by cross-linking of the receptor for antigen. In addition, both mast cells and T cells express numerous inflammation-generating receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins (GPCRs). The purpose of this study is to understand mechanisms of intracellular G-protein-coupled signal transduction in these cells and subsequent pathways to inflammation. In particular, the project focuses on the control of G protein activity in inflammatory processes by a novel family of regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins), which inhibit function of G alpha-i and G alpha-q, but not G alpha-s, subunits by increasing their GTPase activity. G alpha subunits oscillate between GDP- (inactive) and GTP- (active) bound forms based on ligand occupancy of the associated receptor. The GTPase accelerating (GAP) activity of RGS proteins limits the time of interaction of active G-alpha and its effectors, resulting in desensitization of GCPR signaling. Despite a growing body of knowledge concerning the biochemical mechanisms of RGS action, little is known about the physiological role of these proteins in native mammalian systems. RGS13, a GAP for Gi and Gq, but not Gs, was found to be expressed in murine and human mast cells (MCs) and B lymphocytes. Rgs13-deficient mice were generated to determine the function of RGS13 in these cell types. Allergic (MC-dependent) physiological responses were evaluated in these mice. Surprisingly, both cutaneous and systemic anaphylaxis induced by cross-linking of MC antigen receptors with IgE antibody were markedly increased in RGS13-deficient mice. This abnormality was caused by enhanced IgE-evoked degranulation of cultured bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Reconstitution of these BMMCs with RGS13 inhibited degranulation. In addition, the GAP activity of RGS13 was not required for this effect. Rather, subsequent detailed molecular analysis revealed that RGS13 regulates IgE-mediated allergic responses by interacting with the p85 regulatory subunit of the enzyme phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), which is a critical component of the allergen-induced signaling route leading to MC degranulation. These results have uncovered a new physiological function of RGS13 in mast cells. We hypothesize that abnormalities in RGS13 expression or function may exist in patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis or other disorders accompanied by increased mast cell reactivity. Unexpectedly, RGS13 overexpression in an epithelial cell line inhibited cAMP generation induced by stimulation of a Gs-coupled receptor and by forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase. The biochemical basis for this effect was investigated using downstream activators of this signaling pathway. We found that RGS13 acts in the nucleus where it binds the activated (phosphorylated) form of the transcription factor CREB, which is the target of the cAMP pathway. RGS13 overexpression inhibited CREB promoter occupancy in vivo and suppressed CREB-dependent gene expression, while siRNA-mediated knockdown of RGS13 expression had the opposite effect. RGS13-deficient B lymphocytes displayed increased CREB DNA binding and transcription of a CREB target gene, OCA-B. An RGS highly homologous to RGS13, RGS16, is highly expressed in mouse and human activated T lymphocytes. We are studying the function of RGS16 in T cell migration and activation using RGS16-deficient mice. Lymphoid organs of these mice contain comparable numbers of lymphocytes as their wild-type counterparts. RGS16 expression was upregulated by T-cell-receptor stimulation of both murine CD4 and CD8 cells. Splenic B and T cells from RGS16 knockout mice migrated more in vitro after exposure to the chemokines CCL21, CXCL12, and CXCL13. Current studies involve examination of the immune responses after immunization with T-dependent antigens.',\n",
       " \"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are a group of neurodegenerative diseases including scrapie in sheep, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. The possibility that the infectious agent which causes BSE may have infected humans in Great Britain underscores the importance of understanding the process which enables the infectious agent of the TSE to cross species barriers. Susceptibility to infection across species barriers is influenced by the amino acid homology between a normal host protein (PrP-sen) and the abnormal proteinase K-resistant form of this protein, PrP-res, which is closely associated with infectivity. Our studies have focused both on identifying the region of PrP-sen involved in the formation of PrP-res and characterizing mutations in PrP and their effect on disease pathogenesis. We have developed an assay in mouse scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells to model species barrier effects in the conversion of PrP-sen to PrP-res. Using this assay we have shown that, at the level of formation of PrP-res, a single amino acid residue in PrP can control the species barrier between mouse and hamster scrapie. This data suggests that species barriers in the TSE are dependent on interactions between species-specific conformations of PrP molecules. We have assayed PrP-sen mutations associated with familial CJD in uninfected mouse neuroblastoma cells and found that these molecules are more protease-resistant than normal PrP-sen. These data suggest that mutations in PrP-sen may influence the processing of the PrP molecule and predispose certain types of PrP-sen to form PrP-res. Recent data from our lab suggests that multimeric forms of PrP are involved in the conversion of PrP-sen to PrP-res. We previously identified a dimeric form of hamster PrP which has properties intermediate between those of PrP-sen and PrP-res and fulfills many of the properties expected of an intermediate in the conversion process. We have now found that formation of the dimer is controlled at the level of transcription by sequences in the 3' untranslated region of the hamster PrP mRNA and not by the PrP amino acid sequence as expected. Our data suggest that transcriptional control of PrP can generate PrP molecules which resemble PrP-res. \",\n",
       " 'Murine Leukemia viruses infect mice and cause various types of leukemias and also neurological diseases. The study of these viruses in genetically defined strains of mice provides a way to determine how virus host interactions are important in disease, and provides clues about methods to prevent or treat human retroviral infections. We have been investigating the immune mechanisms involved in resistance to retroviral infections and found important roles for both antibody and cell-mediated immunity. We then developed a monoclonal antibody therapy to treat Friend Murine Leukemia Virus infections and discovered two host factors which influenced therapeutic efficacy. Our finding that the levels of CD4 positive T-cells in the host affected the efficacy of therapy has implications for similar therapies for HIV in humans. We also developed new knowledge regarding the immunological requirements for retroviral vaccines. Recombinant vaccinia virus vaccines with multiple T-helper and B-cell epitopes derived from viral envelope proteins primed for rapid IgG responses and protected mice from challenge in the absence of cytolytic T-lymphocytes (CTL). However, vaccines containing single T and B-cell epitopes could not protect in the absence of CTL, even though CTL epitopes were not required in the vaccine. In another study we created viruses containing chimeric envelope genes that allowed us to map viral determinants involved in virus induced neurological disease. We found two separate regions of envelope which could induce neurological disease independently from each other. Combination of the two neuropathogenic regions increased the tempo of disease but did not appear to affect the clinical signs. These studies may have relevance to HIV-associated dementia which also appears to be influenced by the type of envelope carried by the virus. ',\n",
       " 'In the past year, we advanced the goals of this project as follows. (1) To understand the function of the rotavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), we created a battery of recombinant baculoviruses expressing forms of the polymerase with mutations of residues potentially linked to recognition and replication of viral RNAs. Methods for the purification of the recombinant viral polymerases in their active forms were also refined in the past year. In vitro assays performed with the purified proteins will be used to assess the role of individual residues and structural motifs on polymerase activities. (2) To understand the structure and function of the rotavirus inner shell capsid protein VP2, we produced mutant forms of the protein using recombinant baculoviruses. Analysis of these mutant species allowed the identification of epitopes on the surface of the VP2 capsid accessible to monoclonal antibodies. In vitro replication assays carried out with the mutant species also allowed the mapping of domains on VP2 required for induction of the catalytic activity of the viral RNA polymerase. Additional mutants will be produced to further define the interactive domain of VP2 that triggers polymerase activity. (3) X-ray crystallographic analysis of NSP2 with its nucleotide substrates allowed the characterization of intermediate states in nucleotide hydrolysis by the protein. In addition, enzymatic analyses performed on NSP2 indicate that the protein has NDP kinase activity, a property possibly allowing NSP2 to maintain pools of nucleotides for RNA replication in viral inclusion factories. (4) Enzymatic analysis of NSP5 revealed that the protein has catalytic activity capable of hydrolyzing ATP. This ATPase activity may provide its infected-cell partner NSP2 with the gamma-phosphate that it needs to maintain pools of nucleotides for RNA replication in viral inclusion factories.',\n",
       " 'White blood cells called T lymphocytes play critical roles in immune defense against viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and cancer cells. They are also involved in allergies asthma due to the development of an unwanted or excessive type of immune response to substances in our environment and in autoimmune diseases that result from the inappropriate attack of these cells on the body\\'s own tissues. T cells develop in a gland called the thymus, where they learn to distinguish the natural components of the body from the mutant proteins in tumor cells or those produced by infectious agents. This education process involves allowing cells with useful forms of surface proteins called receptors to mature into functional T cells and eliminating cells with inappropriate receptors before they can become dangerous. This process must work properly to generate the set of T cells needed for effective responses to invading organisms and cancer, without allowing development of those cells harmful to normal body tissues. One goal of our work is to understand how this \"education selection\" process occurs and the stages through which the maturing T cells pass. Because T cells see foreign substances (antigens) in the form of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule complexes on cell surfaces, we also wish to know how such materials interact with the T cell receptor to guide the development of T cells in the thymus and the activities of mature T cells in the body. A careful re-examination of the generally accepted scheme of thymocyte development has led us to propose a new model that more fully explains a number of discrepancies among previously published studies and that provides new insight into the signals required for effective development of a mature T cell. We have also determined that a large number of T cells that could potentially mature (as many as half) are killed within the thymus at a late stage of development. This finding has importance for understanding the potential errors in tolerance induction that may underlie autoimmune disease. ',\n",
       " 'We have been studying the rabbit appendix and find that it is an important site of development of the cells destined to produce protective antibodies. In the young rabbit, there is rapid growth and expansion of B lymphocytes in the appendix, and positive and negative selection events appear to occur within this organ. Because of the remarkable finding that the developing rabbit appendix is a site of repertoire diversification and selection, we are extending our findings from the rabbit model to studies of the developing human immune system. We are initiating investigations aimed at determining whether the human appendix or other Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissues (GALT) are important sites of early events in human B cell development, diversification and selection. In addition we are asking whether appendix functions in the diversification of the antibody repertoire during repopulation of other lymphoid organs, if the repertoire diversity or B-lymphocyte numbers of these organs are reduced by a genetic defect, irradiation or chemotherapy. Studies of human embryonic development show that the distal midgut and ileocecal portion of the digestive system, including the appendix, are developmentally homologous with the bursa of Fabricius. In view of our new findings in the rabbit model that indicate that the rabbit appendix has functions similar to the avian bursa, we believe it is important to conduct a new evaluation of the role of human GALT in development of the human immune repertoire and mucosal immunity.

       " 'Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGID) are a spectrum of diseases characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. In the past decade, there has been a increase in the incidence of EGID. EGID, including eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG) and eosinophilic esophagitis, are commonly associated with food and aeroallergen hypersensitivity. Many EGID patients have numerous food allergies, and in some patients an amino acid based elemental diet is an effective treatment. This suggests that EGID pathogenesis is due to food allergen driven eosinophilic inflammation. At present, there are major gaps in our understanding of, and ability to effectively treat these diseases. To address both treatment and pathogenesis questions, we have recently completed a clinical trial of omalizumab (therapeutic monoclonal anti-IgE) for eosinophilic gastroenteritis. This study asks two major questions: 1. are anti-IgE therapeutics of clinical utility in eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, 2. is the eosinophilic inflammation characteristic of EGID an IgE dependent process Preliminary analysis of the study demonstrates that omalizumab was well tolerated by all subjects. Omalizumab treatment was effective in blocking IgE in EG patients as shown by a 100-1000 fold shift in allergen driven basophil activation and by reductions in free IgE. Omalizumab treatment caused a significant drop in peripheral blood eosinophilia and in subjects EG symptoms. Current work is focused on analysis of gut biopsies to examine the effect of omalizumab on eosinophilic infiltration.',\n",
       " \"This project is based on our discovery that genetic mutations in molecules that control the programmed death, or apoptosis, of lymphocytes underlie the Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS). ALPS is a disease affecting children in which a loss of normal lymphocyte homeostasis leads to swollen lymph glands and organs. Because lymphocytes are the primary cells mediating immune reactions, this excess of lymphocytes leads to a pathological autoimmune attack on the patient's own tissues. We have identified mutations in a death-inducing cell surface receptor termed Fas (also known as APO-1 or CD95) and, in the past year, proteolytic enzymes that are crucial to lymphocyte programmed cell death. These studies promise to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that underly autoimmune disease as well as revealing crucial steps in the pathway of programmed cell death in lymphocytes. \",\n",
       " 'To characterize functions of the HIV-1 Gag matrix (MA) protein and define domains involved in these functions, we have introduced over 70 single and double amino acid mutations throughout MA. Biological and biochemical analysis identified classes of mutations which: i) impaired Gag membrane binding or myristylation, ii) blocked Env incorporation into virions, iii) blocked virus assembly, iv) impaired virus entry, or v) redirected assembly from the plasma membrane to cytoplasmic compartments. During the course of these studies, viral revertants of all classes of mutations were obtained and characterized. The majority of second-site changes identified in the MA region of these revertant viruses were located distantly from the original mutations in the primary sequence. When introduced into MA in the presence of the original mutations, these second-site changes compensated for the defects caused by the original substitutions, suggesting a direct or functional interaction between the pairs of distantly-located amino acids. The second-site changes were also introduced in the context of wild-type MA and some of them caused defects in HIV-1 replication, suggesting structural or functional interdependency between the second-site and original mutations. The mutational analysis and characterization of revertants further our understanding of the relationship between MA structure and function, and enable us to delineate the role of MA in the HIV-1 life cycle. Sequence comparison of a number of primate lentivirus isolates reveals a very high degree of sequence conservation at MA amino acid 20 (Leu). Mutations at this position, in particular Lys and Arg substitutions, delayed or blocked virus replication in T-cell lines, primary PBMC, and human macrophages. Biochemical analyses revealed that the residue 20 mutations did not affect virus assembly and release, Env incorporation into virions, exogenous RT activity, or RNA encapsidation. However, a defect early in the virus life cycle was observed in single cycle (MAGI) infectivity assays, which demonstrated a 10-fold reduction in virus infectivity. Kinetic analyses of reverse transcription by PCR using a range of primers at early time points post-infection in both primary macrophages and T-cell lines indicated that viral DNA synthesis was impaired in cells infected with the mutant virus. Intriguingly, viral DNA synthesis was diminished in endogenous RT assays. A viral revertant maintained the position 20 change and acquired second-site changes at residues 73 and 82. Interestingly, activity of the revertant virus in the endogenous RT assay was restored to wild-type levels. Lentiviruses, including HIV-1, possess transmembrane envelope (Env) glycoproteins with unusually long cytoplasmic tails. A prominent structural feature of the HIV-1 cytoplasmic domain is the presence of two predicted a-helices in the central (a-helix 2) and C-terminal (a-helix 1) portions of the cytoplasmic domain. To characterize these domains, we have introduced a number of truncations, deletions, and single and double amino acid substitution mutations throughout both a-helical domains. The effects on Env expression, Env incorporation into virions, virus infectivity in MAGI cells, virus replication in T-cells, and syncytium formation have been assessed. The results indicate that the gp41 cytoplasmic tail a-helical domains play an important role in Env incorporation and virus infectivity, and identify specific functional determinants within these domains. We also observed that several mutations in gp41 a-helix 2 markedly impair Gag processing, and that this defective Gag processing is relieved by a matrix (MA) mutation which blocks Env incorporation into virions. This phenomenon supports the hypothesis that MA and gp41 interact during Gag and Env transport and virus assembly. It has been suggested that the matrix (MA) domain of HIV-1 Gag plays a central role in translocating the HIV-1 preintegration complex to the nucleus following infection of non-dividing cells. Recent publications proposed that phosphorylation of 1% of MA on a C-terminal Tyr (residue 131) was required to reverse the membrane binding properties of MA and promote an association between MA and the integrase protein, thus enabling MA to assist in translocating the HIV-1 preintegration complex to the nucleus. The critical piece of biological data in support of this model was that mutation of MA Tyr 131 to Phe blocked infection of differentiated primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. To confirm this observation, we introduced the same single amino acid substitution (Tyr->Phe) at residue 131 of MA. We demonstrated that: i) in cells from numerous macrophage donors, ii) in two different primary macrophage purification culture systems, iii) in the context of two different macrophage-tropic molecular clones, and iv) in the presence or absence of a functional vpr gene, the 131YF mutation had no detectable effect on infectivity. These data, together with our previous studies, challenge the hypothesis that MA is involved in nuclear targeting of the viral preintegration complex in terminally differentiated primary human macrophages.

       " 'HIV-1 infection includes an initial acute clinical syndrome typically followed by a prolonged clinical latency and the eventual development of AIDS. A substantial percentage of HIV-1-infected subjects remain disease-free for many years with a low viral load and an intact lymph-node architecture. Moreover, cohorts of HIV-1-exposed individuals who remain free of infection over a long period of viral exposure have been described. The molecular basis of this heterogeneous clinical presentation is unknown; one possibility is that differences in humoral immune responses to yet unrecognized epitopes may contribute to the development of a long-term non progressive state of HIV-1 infection. The aim of this project is to systematically compare the antibody specificities of typically progressive and non-progressive HIV-1-infected subjects. Specifically, we plan to identify the immunogenic epitopes recognized by the antibodies present in these different groups of individuals. To this end, Random Peptide Libraries (RPL) displayed on phages have been utilized. These libraries carry random sequences of nine residues expressed in frame with the pVIII coat protein of f11.1 filamentous phages. Up to 2,700 copies of a single epitope can be displayed on a single phage particle, while the complexity of the libraries is 2 x 10 7 independent clones. Two different libraries have been utilized to identify epitopes specifically recognized by serum immunoglobulins of subjects affected by different clinical degrees of HIV-1 infection. An original methodology has been developed whereby HIV-1-specific epitopes were isolated by using sequential steps of purification: a) immunoaffinity selection of phages by HIV-positive sera immunoglobulins bound to magnetic beads; b) immunoscreening of the eluted phages transferred on nitrocellulose filters; c) selection of the phage clones by ELISA; d) purification of the phage colonies and sequencing of the inserted peptide. The results are as follows: from the initial input of 2 X 10 13 phages, 625 phage colonies were selected for their reactivity with sera from 30 HIV-positive subjects and counter-screened against 50 sera from HIV-negative healthy subjects. 10 clones were selected for their consistent association with HIV-positive sera and the absence of reactivity with control sera. These clones were amplified and sequenced. The sequence analysis revealed that two clones carry a peptide belonging to a region of HIV-1 Env and Gag protein, respectively, while the remaining peptides likely represent discontinuous epitopes. The purified phages have been injected into mice to test for their immunogenicity. Moreover, the selected phages have been utilized to immunoaffinity purify the epitope-specific antibodies from HIV-infected subject. These HIV-specific antibodies are currently being tested for the capacity to interfere in vitro with HIV-1 infection of autologous or heterologous T lymphocytes. ',\n",
       " 'I am studying the early steps in retroviral infection, particularly the fusion of viral and cell membranes mediated by viral envelope (Env) proteins and cellular receptors. How these proteins work is poorly understood on a molecular level. The greatest insights have come from protein crystallization studies that reveal conformational differences in Env proteins under different conditions believed to characterize different stages of the fusion process. However, such studies only provide snapshots of protein shape. Understanding how these shape changes catalyze membrane fusion will likely require ways to see details of the refolding process over time. New methods that detect single molecules and reveal aspects of their motion in real time are providing unparalleled insights into a variety of molecular machines like motor proteins. One of these methods, called the single molecule tether technique, involves sandwiching a molecule of interest between a surface, like a microscope slide, and a plastic bead about the size of a bacterium. The bead is about 100-1000x bigger than the molecule, just large enough to be seen as an object with some linear extent in a light microscope. Clever linkage between the molecule of interest and the bead allows motion of the molecule to be transmitted to the bead and detected. The fact that molecular motion can influence the motion of objects the size of bacteria is familiar in another context - the well-known phenomenon of Brownian motion. The latter also needs to be taken into account as a source of noise in these experiments. I am trying to detect a particular kind of molecular motion, rotation, by converting it to rotation of the bead. Bead rotation can be directly observed in a microscope by attaching one or a few small fluorescent spots to the bead surface. This is done using commercially available beads coated with streptavidin and much smaller, brightly fluorescent beads coated with biotin. Biotin and streptavidin stick together like a strong glue, leading effectively to point sources of fluorescent light at various positions on a beads surface. The random Brownian rotation of the beads can be reduced by using magnetic beads, which orient in an external magnetic field like iron filings. By changing the direction of the applied magnetic field, one can control the beads orientation, which is clearly demonstrated in microscope videos. The Brownian rotation is then largely restricted to rotation about the magnetic field axis. With a collaborator in NICHD, I measured the extent of rotation about the magnetic field axis as a function of time. This is a measure of the rotational diffusion constant of the beads, and the result was consistent with a theoretical prediction based on the beads diameter and the viscosity of the surrounding liquid. While each beads orientation could be held relatively constant by the magnet, slight changes in orientation due to Brownian motion could also be detected and quantified. The magnitude of this type of Brownian motion provided a measure of the torque one could apply to a bead with the external magnetic field. Our result was roughly consistent with expectation given the magnetic field strength and magnetic specifications of the beads. These measurements give us confidence that our tracking methods are accurate and will enable us to characterize rotational motion imparted to beads by tethered molecules in the presence of Brownian noise contributed by molecules of the bathing liquid. We next made a model molecular tether whose motion we believe we can predict. The model molecule is a single-stranded piece of DNA that folds into a double-stranded helical stem and a single-stranded loop, forming a lollipop configuration. DNA molecules with this configuration are used as sensitive detectors called molecular beacons because target pieces of DNA that have the right DNA sequence to bind to the loop region, force the stem to melt, which can be detected as an increase in fluorescence in appropriately labeled molecules. We put chemical groups (BrdU) on extensions of the stem region to attach the base of the DNA stem to a glass slide coated with antibodies to BrdU. We predict that melting the stem of DNA beacon molecules attached to the glass in this fashion will force the loop region to rotate about 270 degrees, since in an 8 base pair double-stranded helix (the length of the stem in our molecule) the strands wrap around each other about three quarters of a complete turn. To couple this rotation to a streptavidin bead, we put several biotin groups at the end of the loop region, and allow these beads to bind beacon DNA attached to glass. We confirmed that the beacon stem melts in this configuration when we add target pieces of DNA complementary to the loop region using a standard fluorescence beacon assay. The goal of this experiment is to convert binding of a single target DNA to 270-degree rotation of a bead tethered to the glass via a single beacon DNA. This kind of conversion of DNA binding to bead rotation has not been previously reported. If successful, with further development, it might provide a way to detect in real time other conformational changes in nucleic acid molecules triggered by different kinds of single molecule binding events, such as the binding of antigens to aptamer nucleic acid probes. This method could also provide a way to characterize unwinding pathways of regulatory RNAs. We still have considerable technical hurdles to overcome. The proximity of the bead to the glass could lead to non-specific interactions that prevent rotation. Our attachment strategy could fail to anchor the beacon down at both ends, or fail to attach the loop to the bead at more than one spot, in which case the loop could rotate without turning the bead. However, we have some ideas for ways to deal with these possibilities. The longer-range goal is to replace the model DNA tether with a protein molecule whose conformational change one wishes to observe, such as a viral Env molecule. Protein tethers provide considerable additional technical challenges in terms of attaching the protein molecule to the surface and the bead in a way that is rotationally constrained. For this reason, we have concentrated in the first part of this project on DNA tethers whose attachment modes are easier to engineer and whose motion is easier to predict.',\n",
       " 'New methods for detection of specific DNA segments using fluorescence energy transfer probes allow DNA amplification and detection to be performed in a closed system, which has great promise for clinical applications of DNA diagnostics. The sensitivity of such assays is usually about 100-1000 target DNA molecules in a 10 microliter reaction. We found that by reducing the volume of such reactions 100- to 1000-fold (performing the reaction in microcapillaries), we could routinely detect single DNA target molecules. This is important because it makes it feasible to quantitate the number of starting DNA molecules by performing replicate reactions on limiting dilutions of sample and counting the number of positive reactions. To facilitate this kind of analysis, we developed a microscope slide-like device that automatically partitions a approximately 10 microliter drop of reaction solution into approximately 100 subportions, each of which is protected from evaporation during the DNA amplification. The partitioning mechanism relies on surface tension forces. Results of amplification in the slide-like device should be readable with flat plate fluorescence imagers commonly used for analysis of DNA gels and membranes. Development of the slide-like device was done in collaboration with an industrial partner with expertise in surface coatings, under a cooperative research and development agreement. ',\n",
       " \"Our understanding of the physiology of the tubercle bacillus is limited by our artificial in vitro axenic growth conditions. The completion of the genomic DNA sequence of a virulent strain of the bacterium (H37Rv) offered a glimpse into the varied metabolic potential of this complex Actinomycete. Far from the textbook description of an obligate aerobe, the tubercle bacillus has preserved all of the machinery necessary for life without oxygen. Likewise, far from growth on glucose in a laboratory flask the bacillus appears to be supremely adapted for living off of abundant host lipid constituents. The studies encompassed within this project all have in common the aim of discerning the nature of the intracellular physiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and modulation of the host's response to infection during actual disease. In addition the variation among circulating strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with respect to these properties has been studied. Within this broad project area there were significant advances in three major areas this reporting year: First, in the area of genetic variability amongst extant clinical strains of tuberculosis we described, together with our collaborators at the Russian Academy of Sciences, a new technique for comparative genomic analysis and its application to epidemic strains in the Former Soviet Union. Second we have continued to characterize the hypervariable polyketide-derived lipid known as the phenolic glycolipid which is present among a subset of circulating strains of the Beijing W family. A significant question was the extent of the immunosuppressive effect of this molecule during infection. Using a mixed infection model we were ale to show that this molecule exerts only a local effect, conferring on strains expressing it a survival advantage even in competition with strains that lack this molecule. In addition we continue to explore the downstream immunomodulatory effects of this molecule in collaboration with scientists at the Public Health Research Institute. These studies have resulted in significant progress in understanding the molecular mechanism of this important virulence determinant of TB. Third we have made significant progress in understanding the biochemical target and activation process of bicyclic nitroimidazoles, including PA-824. The careful selection of mutants of biochemically defined properties, assisted by the chemical synthesis of analogs to refine the mutant phenotypes studied allowed the identification of the major protein involved in nitroreduction. The final identification of the gene involved employed a novel whole-genome resequencing technique based upon tiled arrays of the known genomic sequence of MTb.\",\n",
       " 'Our long-term immunologic studies of post-infectious fatigue disorders stimulated us to study immunologic responses to well-defined acute infections. To this end, we began two years ago to collaborate with investigators at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville who study influenza infection, its treatment, and prevention. They study patients in their community with naturally acquired influenza A virus infection and volunteers who are challenged with the virus. We developed assays for several human cytokines and measured their content in nasal secretions and plasma during and following acute infection. Cytokine levels are correlated with patient symptoms, fever, and virus shedding. Recently, we documented highly significant rises in local and systemic levels of interleukin-6 and TNF-alpha that correlate well with virus shedding and symptoms. We are now extending such studies as part of Phase I and II therapeutic trials of new neuraminidase inhibitor drugs for influenza. These studies indicate the nature and importance of immune responses in resolution of the infection and in symptom formation. ',\n",
       " 'A collaborative investigation has been initiated this past year to find effective chemical inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by targeting highly conserved structures within the virus particle, namely, the zinc fingers of the nucleocapsid protein p7 (NCp7). These zinc protein structures control the expression of a segment of the viral genomic RNA involved in replication and assembly of the virus. Relative intolerance to mutations affecting NCp7 should render drugs targeting this region unlikely to induce drug-resistant strains of HIV. The work is being shared between this Section and the Laboratory of Cell Biology (NCI), the Laboratory of Antiviral Drug Mechanisms and Laboratory of Mathematical Biology (NCI, Frederick, MD). In drug design we are departing from known NCp7 inhibitors of the disulfide dibenzamide type in order to more effectively destroy the zinc finger structures, likewise, through formation of covalent linkages with their constituent cysteine sulfhydryl groups. The aim is to develop a relatively nontoxic, inexpensive antiviral drug that can be used to treat infections with all strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2. Active lead compounds have been identified through a variety of in vitro tests that assess antiviral activity, toxicity, target specificity and mechanism of action. One compound is currently being considered for testing in an animal (mouse) model of human HIV infection. This laboratory has been mainly responsible for directing the design and synthesis of trial compounds and for assisting in their synthesis. ',\n",
       " 'In the past year, we have advanced the objectives of this project along several lines. (1) To develop a reverse genetics system, we have determined the complete genome sequences of several lab-adapted strains of rotavirus. Subsequently, we have cloned all the genome segments of some strains into specialized T7-transcription vectors successfully used in creating reverse genetics systems for other viruses, including reovirus, a segmented dsRNA virus similar to rotavirus. We are currently attempting to use these vectors along with appropriate recombinant vaccinia viruses that express T7 RNA polymerase to generate recombinant rotaviruses. (2) To identify determinants in rotavirus affecting its virulence and pathogenesis, we have continued studies on one of its nonstructural proteins, NSP1. This protein was found earlier to subvert the innate immune system by interfering with the ability of the host to express interferon. During this past year, we have learned much about the mechanism by which NSP1 performs this function. Our experiments show that NSP1 interacts with and induces the degradation of a key family of cellular transcription factors in the infected cell required for interferon expression, and thus interferes with the activation of antiviral pathways. (3) To understand more about the diversity of rotavirus genes and its potential impact on the pathogenesis, evolution and epidemiology of these viruses, we sequenced the complete genomes of 10 distinct strains of human rotaviruses, representative of the 10 G-serotypes of viruses known to infect man. These data indicate that except for the immunodominant outer capsid proteins (VP4 and VP7) of rotavirus, the other nine viral proteins can be separated by-in-large into one of three phylogenically-distinct genogroups. Moreover, our results indicate that a hallmark feature of the major G-serotypes of rotaviruses circulating in nature is that they express preferred constellations of rotavirus proteins. Such constellations suggest the co-evolution of rotavirus genes falling within the same genogroup, raising the possibility that proteins within the same genogroup work best with one another. Thus, although rotavirus can undergo reassortment, such reassortants may not be viable in nature, because they create mismatched constellations of protein that fail to work efficiently with each other in support of virus replication.',\n",

       " 'Yersinia pestis, the Gram-negative bacterial agent of plague, remains an international public health concern, and recent outbreaks in human populations in India and Africa have led to its classification as a reemerging disease. Two new concerns add to the threat to human health posed by present and future plague outbreaks. The emergence of multiply-antibiotic resistant strains of Y. pestis makes possible pneumonic plague epidemics that could not be controlled by standard prophylactic treatment . The potential illegitimate release of Y. pestis by bioterrorists also increases the urgency for a more detailed understanding of the host-pathogen relationship at the molecular level that may lead to the design of improved medical countermeasures and diagnostics. Plague is a zoonosis that is present in wild rodent populations worldwide and is transmitted primarily by fleas. The objective of this project is to identify and determine the function of Y. pestis genes that mediate flea-borne transmission. The molecular and genetic mechanisms that enable Y. pestis, uniquely among the Enterobacteriaceae, to utilize a blood-sucking insect for transmission have not been investigated. We are studying the interaction of Y. pestis with its insect vector by using an artificial feeding apparatus to infect fleas with uniform doses of wild type or specific Y. pestis mutants. We seek to identify Y. pestis genes that are required for the bacteria to infect the flea midgut and to produce blockage of the flea foregut that is required for biological transmission. We have termed these genes transmission factors (analogous to virulence factors, the genes required for pathogenesis in the mammal). The strategy entails first identifying bacterial genes that are differentially expressed at a temperature typical of the cold- blooded flea host (20C) as opposed to the temperature of the warm-blooded mammalian host (37C). Specific mutations are then introduced into these genes, and the mutants tested for their ability to infect and block the flea vector. Identification of such transmission factors allows further studies into the molecular mechanisms of the bacterial infection of the flea vector. Detailed understanding of the interaction with the insect host may lead to novel strategies to interrupt the transmission cycle, and may be applicable to other arthropod-borne agents. The work also provides a model that can be applied to other arthropod-borne bacterial pathogens.',\n",
       " 'Borrelia burgdorferi, the infectious agent of Lyme disease, is transmitted to mammals through the bite of infected Ixodes ticks. During transmission, B. burgdorferi must recognize and adapt to changes in the environment. Bacterial oligopeptide permeases, five membrane-associated proteins belonging to the ABC transporter family, provide a mechanism for the uptake of small peptides, which not only provide nutrients but often serve as environmental signals that lead to a variety of adaptive responses. We speculate that in B. burgdorferi oligopeptide permease may be involved in sensing and signaling a response to the changing conditions that accompany transmission between ticks and mammals. To investigate this possibility, we have identified and characterized a chromosomal locus that encodes homologs of all five components, as well as two plasmid-encoded components. We have examined gene expression of the oligopeptide components at temperatures that mimic ticks and mammals. We have also undertaken genetic studies to aid in determining the physiological role that oligopeptide permease plays in the natural infectious cycle of B. burgdorferi. ',\n",
       " 'Hypereosinophilic conditions have been studied extensively, and we have identified new markers that distinguish among several important variants of this syndrome. The interaction between helminth infeciton and allergic disease has been studied using epidemiological tools coupled with physiological measurements of allergic disease and immunological assessments. We have demonstrated that chronic helminth infection protects against allergic diseases. Studies done to date have demonstrated the CD4+ cells (and neither the monocytes nor the basophils) are the overwhelmingly major source of IL-10 in chronic filarial infection We have developed quantitative methods for examination of germline transcription for each of the antibody isotypes and have begun to use these methods to examine the molecular events that occur when antigens induce specific switch recombination events. Also baseline IgE and IgG4 germline transcription profiles have been measured in patients with allergic and parasitic infections and associated elevations of IgE and IgG4.',\n",
       " 'The broad purpose of this work is to further understand how microorganisms and vaccine adjuvants via their interaction with antigen presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, affect the generation of T cell mediated immune responses via their ability to regulate the production of critical cytokines, such as IL-12 and IL-10. We have focused our work on the regulation of IL-12 production by G-protein signaling. Over the past year we have demonstrated that signaling via Gi2alpha coupled receptors can significantly alter immune responses to pathogens by altering the amount of IL-12 that is produced by antigen presenting cells. We have focused on 2 models of infection in mice and can show that signals via Gi2alpha are important for the inhibition or control of IL-12 production and cell-mediated immune responses to Leishmania major infection, while signals via this pathway are important for the positive induction of IL-12 in response to infection by another parasitic pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii. We are currently determining why the same signaling pathway can have such dramatically different effects on immune responses depending on the invading pathogen. We are also exploring ways to exploit these signaling pathways for suppression of autoimmune disease or the augmentation of immunity to pathogens. Finally, we are exploring the signaling pathways by which G-proteins regulate the production of IL-12 and other cytokines produced by macrophages and dendritic cells.',\n",
       " 'In our search for understanding the evolution of blood sucking by arthropods, we realize the methodology used has drastically changed in the past few years. Traditionally, the research process first identified a biological activity in saliva or salivary gland homogenates of a particular organism, and then proceeded to isolate that activity as a relatively pure entity to allow its molecular identification. In the case the activity derived from a protein, peptide fingerprinting allowed the design and use of nucleotide probes to clone the coding mRNA (in the form of a cDNA) and final identification of the peptide sequence; the clone also allowed the manufacture of recombinant protein for further studies. Nowadays, the process has reverted. cDNA libraries are constructed from salivary glands of blood sucking arthropods and mass sequenced. Bioinformatic analysis reveals the salivary transcriptome of these organisms, which contains many unique protein families with unknown properties. We then proceed to select clones for expression, bioassay screening and characterization. Accordingly, there are two processes used in our lab, first, the construction and analysis of salivary gland cDNA libraries, and second, the recombinant expression and characterization of these proteins. We have also been developing bioinformatic capabilities in the form of specific software to help direct our studies. Sialotranscriptome discovery projects: Because host hemostasis (the physiological process that prevents blood loss, consisting of platelet aggregation, blood clotting and vasoconstriction) is a complex and redundant phenomenon, the salivary glands of blood sucking arthropods consist of a magic potion with diverse chemicals that in a redundant way counteract host mechanisms to prevent blood loss, allowing the fast acquisition of a meal. Salivary transcriptome made in the past few years indicate that the magic potion consists of 70-100 different proteins in the case of mosquitoes, for example, to over 400 in the case of ticks (Ticks feed for several days and have to disarm host immune reactions, in addition to the hemostatic system). Transcriptome studies also show that the salivary proteins of blood sucking arthropods are at a very fast pace of evolution, perhaps explaining why every genera studied so far has several unique protein families. Indeed there are unique proteins found at the subgenus level. Given we can now describe in detail the sialotranscriptome (from the Greek word sialo = saliva) of a single organism, we can ask now what is the universe of salivary proteins associated to blood feeding, the so called sialoverse. There are near 19,000 species of blood sucking arthropods in 500 different genera. If we find (minimally) 5 novel protein families per genus (within the 70-500 proteins in each sialome), there are at least 2,500 novel proteins to be discovered, each one with an interesting pharmacological property. We have so far explored less than a dozen genera of blood sucking arthropods, and it is our goal to extend sialotranscriptome discovery to map this pharmacological mine for future studies, and in the process learn the paths taken by genomes in their evolution to blood feeding, and identify proteins with pharmacological and vaccine potential. In the current fiscal year, we produced 5 papers (1-5) describing the sialome of Triatoma infestans, a vector of Chagas disease (1), the flea vector of plague (2) of a non-blood feeding mosquito (3) and of soft ticks (4-5). The T. infestans sialome allowed the comparison of the expanded lipocalin family found in triatomines to that of two other triatomines with known sialomes, T. brasiliensis and Rhodnius prolixus, thus identifying the fast evolution of these proteins. Novel proteins were also discovered. The transcriptome of the flea Xenopsylla cheopis was the first flea transcriptome to be published, and it uncovered a large number of novel protein families. Because mosquitoes also feed on sugar meals, the sialotranscriptome of these insects contain products associated with both sugar and blood meal acquisition. The transcriptome of the non-blood feeding mosquito Toxorhynchites amboinensis allowed an insight into a transcriptome that is thus purely associated with sugar meals, and also with antimicrobial activity, because it is known that antimicrobials, such as lysozyme, are injected with saliva of non-blood feeding mosquitoes. Finally, soft tick transcriptomes allowed the discovery of many unique protein families, comparisons among known protein families, and an insight in the evolution of tick saliva. Functional sialomic studies: We advanced our knowledge regarding the function of several salivary proteins, as well as discovering novel salivary properties, as was the case of sand fly saliva inhibiting neutrophil migration (6), understanding the evolution of tick anti-clotting proteins (7), discovering a novel tick protein family that counteracts inflammatory cysteinyl-lukotrienes (8-9), characterization of a family of biogenic amine binding proteins from ticks (10), characterization of the crystal structure of a mosquito biogenic amine binding protein (11), and further use of the tick anticoagulant Ixolaris as a tool to understand human clotting (12) and adenovirus mediated gene transfer (13). Expertise capabilities spin off: Dr. Francischetti expertise in hemostasis led this year to 2 review articles on malaria and coagulation (14-15), a follow up of an article authored by him in 2007 on tissue factor exposure by endothelial cells contacting Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes. Our bioinformatic capability allowed us to collaborate with Dr. Warwick Britton, specifically to identify in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis a family of cutinase proteins that has vaccine potential (16).',\n",
       " 'As control measures against malaria, my laboratory has focused on the interruption of sporogonic development of the parasite in the mosquito. The fact that most mosquitoes, other than a few Anopheline mosquitoes, are refractory to human malaria transmission suggests that blockades to Plasmodium development do exist in mosquitoes, and it will be useful to understand the nature of this blockade to reduce the transmission of malaria. The initial successes of transmission-blocking vaccines using antigens specific to mosquito stage of the parasite have demonstrated the potential of this approach. The major projects in this program can be classified under, the study of Plasmodium in mosquitoes. I. Mosquito midgut epithelium invasion by ookinete II.

       " 'CD8 + T-cells play a crucial role in eradicating viral infections. The focus of this project is two-fold. First, to study mechanisms that viruses use to subvert CD8 + T-cell responses and second, to understand how primary CD8 + T-cells are stimulated. Despite the importance of T-cells, little attention has been paid to the ability of vaccines to induce CD8 + T-cell memory. For viruses in which traditional vaccine approaches have not been successful, it is hoped that induction of CD8 + T-cell memory will enhance immunity. To induce optimal CD8 + T-cell responses to vaccines it is necessary to understand how primary CD8 + T-cells are stimulated. This project aims to address the following questions; 1. Following a virus infection in what anatomical location are primary TCD8+ cells stimulated (local sites of infection, lymph nodes, spleen) 2. What type of cell presents antigen to primary CD8 + T-cells 3. Is the antigen presenting cell infected, or does it present viral proteins obtained from infected cells 4. How do the answers to questions 1-3 vary between different antigens encoded by the same virus and the same antigen encoded by different viruses',\n",
       " 'The purpose of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the replication of picornaviruses in susceptible target cells. This virus family includes numerous human pathogens (poliovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus, rhinoviruses, hepatitis A virus). Infection of cells with these viruses leads to drastic changes in the host cells structure and metabolic activity. Cellular protein and RNA synthesis are inhibited; the intracellular membrane network becomes rearranged into a network of vesicles that surround and provide a scaffold for viral RNA replication complexes; cellular proteins are subverted into facilitating viral protein and RNA synthesis. The unique combination of viral and cellular proteins together accomplishes a highly efficient production of viral RNA, proteins, and particles. During FY2008, we have developed and utilized a method to select for sites in picornaviral proteins that are able to tolerate the insertion of extra amino acids while still retaining viability of the viruses that carry these insertions. We have identified such sites so far in four proteins essential for viral RNA replication. We then screened for the abilities of these sites to retain and express viral proteins carrying (a) fluorescent protein tags for localization and live cell imaging studies, (b) epitope tags for identifying cellular and viral protein binding partners, and (c) affinity tags for purification. These viruses encoding tagged proteins are currently being used to determine the location and movement of individual viral proteins in the replication complex, and to determine the functions and interactions of individual viral proteins during infection. Another key viral replication protein has been purified and its biochemical activities and biophysical properties have been analyzed. We have shown that this protein (designated 2C) forms oligomers of 6-8 subunits, and that the oligomeric protein is required for ATPase activity. Finally, we have made great progress in understanding the structure and function(s) of the membrane-associated replication complexes that are induced to form in infected cells. Viral proteins that trigger different aspects of membrane remodeling have been identified, and a cellular protein, guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GBF1) has been shown to participate in the RNA synthesis function of the newly-formed replication complex. This latter finding represents a new cellular pathway in which a host cell factor has been identified on which poliovirus (and other positive-strand RNA viruses) replication depends. Three-dimensional tomographic electron microscopy is in progress to reconstruct the three dimensional stucture of the replication complex membranes.',\n",
       " \"TGF-beta is a pleiotropic, multifunctional cytokine with potent immunoregulatory properties. Nearly all cells of leukocyte lineage express the cytokine. Although not completely understood, the role of TGF-beta has been established as the primary inhibitory cytokine in many processes including inflammatory responses, carcinogenesis and oral tolerance. TGF-beta treatment leads to cell-cycle arrest at the late G1 phase through the expression of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 molecule. The TGF-beta receptor consists of two chains, type I and II; both are receptor serine threonine kinases. The binding of TGF-beta to the type II receptor recruits and activates the type I receptor, which in turn activates the SMAD signaling pathway, leading to the regulation of gene expression. Due to the lack of structural work, the ligand-binding region of both the receptor and TGF-beta remains unclear. Our objective is to determine the crystal structures of the TGF- beta receptor alone and in complex with TGF-beta. We hope to gain functional insight into the receptor activation. Our first attempt was to crystallize a baculovirus expressed human type II TGF-beta receptor (TBRII) in complex with TGF- beta1. Due to extensive glycosylation on the receptor, the crystallization trials with this receptor did not yield any crystals. Subsequent deglycosylation procedures yielded a partially deglycosylated receptor that produced small crystals when complexed with TGF-beta1. However, these crystals diffracted poorly in the X-ray beam and were not suitable for structure determination. To overcome the carbohydrate heterogeneity and low expression yield of the baculovirus expression system, we have attempted to express the soluble type II receptor in several bacteria expression vector systems. Due to a large number of disulfide bonds (12 cysteines) present in this receptor, previous attempts by other groups to reconstitute the bacteria expressed receptor have all failed. The first bacteria construct we made was a fusion protein of the type II TGF-beta receptor and GST. This resulted in the production of a functional receptor in the soluble fraction of cell lysates, as evident from a TGF- beta binding ELISA assays. However, the yield of TBRII from the GST fusion construct remained low. This was primarily due to the degradation of the linker region between GST and the receptor, that resulted in the majority eluted sample from a glutathione affinity column being free GST rather than the GST-TBRII fusion protein. A typical 10 liter bacteria expression experiment yielded less than 0.5 mg of purified receptor protein. To overcome the problem of low expression yield, we began to investigate the purification schemes by refolding methods, despite previous attempts by others not being successful. As a result, we subcloned the ecto-TBRII (without any fusion partner) into two Novagen's pET vectors, pET14 and pET30, both of which are driven by T7 polymerase. The expression of this construct resulted in large quantities of inclusion bodies. Subsequent refolding experiments yielded milligram quantities of TBRII that appears active in a TGF-beta ELISA assay. The crystallization experiments using this receptor have produced crystals. More recently, we have completed the crystal structure of this receptor at 1.1 angstrom resolution. Another issue hinders the project is the availability of large quantity of recombinant TGF-beta. Current recombinant expression systems yield less than 1-2 mg of the mature TGF-b1 per liter of cell culture medium. In an effort to produce large quantities of the recombinant cytokine for structural studies, we have constructed a mammalian expression system based on a modified pcDNA3.1 vector with a glutamine synthetase gene inserted for gene amplification. The leader peptide of TGF-b1 was replaced with that of rat serum albumin, and an eight-histidine tag was insertedimmediately after the leader sequence to facilitate protein purification. In addition, Cys 33 of TGF-b1, which forms a disulfide bond with LTBP, was replaced by a serine residue. The resulting expression construct produced a stable clone expressing 30 mg of mature TGF-b1 per liter of spent medium. Purified TGF-b1 bound with high affinity to its type II receptor with a solution dissociation constant of 70 nM, and was fully active in both a Mv1Lu cell growth inhibition assay and in a PAI-1 luciferase reporter assay. In the past year, we have constructed similar recombinant CHO expression systems for Tgf-b2 and Tgf-b3. Both recombinant systems yielded 10mg protein per liter of culture media. A patent for the expression system has been filed by NIAID under U.S. Provisional application Nos 60 534,379 and 60 575,839. We have recently crystallized and determined the structure of TGF-beta 1 in complex with the extracellular domains of the type I and type II receptors at 3.0 &#506; resolution. The overall assembly for TGF-b1 ternary complex is very similar to that of TGF-b3 complex with TBRII bound identically to both isoforms of TGF-b. The docking of TBRI on TGF-b1 is 10X different from that of TGF-b3. The structural analysis suggests that the lower TBRII binding affinity to TGF-b2 is the result of replacement of both Arg 25 and Arg 94 in TGF-b1 and -b3 with lysines in TGF-b2. Comparison between the TGF-b and BMP-2 ternary complexes revealed that predominantly hydrogen bonds mediate binding of the cytokines to their high affinity receptors (TBRII and BMPR-IA, respectively), whereas hydrophobic interactions dominate their contacts to the low affinity receptors (TBRI and ActRII, respectively). This suggests the importance of hydrogen bonding in determining the receptor preference for these cytokines. The solution binding studies unexpectedly revealed significant binding of TGF-b2 and -b3 to TBRI. While all three isoforms of TGF-bnassembled their ternary complexes equally efficient, the preference for the type II receptor varied from TGF-b1 being the most to TGF-b2 being the least TBRII dependent. The equal energetic contribution of TBRI and TBRII to the assembly of TGF-b2 signaling complex suggests a simultaneous rather than sequential receptor recruitment model for TGF-b2. The differences in the receptor recruitment provide a potential mechanism for a distinct function of three TGF-b isoforms that is probably coordinated with the cellular and tissue-dependent receptor expressions.\",\n",
       " 'Hepatitis A and E vaccines. The HVS in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium, has developed several candidate live attenuated HAV vaccines. In addition, the HVS has developed a candidate recombinant hepatitis E vaccine that is highly promising and that is currently in clinical trials. In studies to further characterize this candidate hepatitis E vaccine, we have performed extensive pre-clinical trials to determine the potency of the vaccine, the duration of protection, the optimum regimen for administration, its protective efficacy against homologous versus heterologous virus strains, its ability to prevent infection as well as hepatitis and the minimum antibody titer that was effective in preventing infection and hepatitis, respectively. Hepatitis B and C vaccines. The HVS is studying the technology of DNA vaccines with a model system based upon hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine, a vaccine with which the HVS has had extensive experience. We have tested the efficacy of an immunostimulant (CpG) as an adjuvant for DNA vaccines, as well as for protein vaccines. In addition, the utility of DNA vaccines for the control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been explored. A DNA vaccine based on the E2 envelope protein of HCV proved to be highly immunogenic in mice and rhesus monkeys and moderately immunogenic in chimpanzees, but the chimpanzees were not fully protected when they were challenged with live HCV. A similar approach has been utilized in the study of a DNA vaccine based on the E1 envelope protein of HCV: various constructs of the E1 gene were prepared as DNA vaccines (expression vector plasmids) and as vectored vaccines (recombinant vaccinia) and tested in mice. The mice had excellent immune responses to the DNA vaccine as well as to the vaccinia boost. In other studies, recombinant HCV E1 envelope glycoprotein is being tested in chimpanzees as an immunoprophylactic and immunotherapeutic vaccine. Antibodies. Passive immunoprophylaxis has also been an important public health tool. For example, normal immunoglobulin has been important in the prevention of hepatitis A. However, monoclonal preparations could be more potent, tailored to specific neutralization epitopes and highly consistent in potency. We have prepared combinatorial libraries from the bone marrow of chimpanzees that had been experimentally infected in sequence with each of the five human hepatitis viruses. Chimpanzee globulins are virtually identical to human immunoglobulins, making them attractive choices for immunoprophylactic and immunotherapeutic agents. To date, we have isolated monoclonal immunoglobulins that react with HAV, HBV, HDV and HEV. In other studies, we have recovered human monoclonal antibodies that react with HCV. Many of the monoclonal antibodies described above are neutralizing and their production is being scaled up for tests of passive immunoprophylaxis in chimpanzees and, eventually, humans. Similar construction of combinatorial libraries from bone marrow has been carried out for chimpanzees that have been experimentally infected with dengue viruses 1 through 4: these have yielded important neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to dengue virus types 1, 2 and 4. We have now extended these studies to other viruses and bacteria of interest that can be experimentally administered to chimpanzees. For example, in response to new concerns about bioterrorism, we are preparing neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to vaccinia virus for use as an immunoprophylactic immunotherapeutic agent in those who require immunization with vaccinia but who are susceptible to the side-effects of such immunization. Similarly, we have immunized chimpanzees with anthrax toxin in an attempt to make monoclonal antibodies that could immediately neutralize anthrax in vivo and have isolated a highly potent monoclonal antibody that can neutralize the toxin. We are also preparing chimpanzee monoclonal antibodies to the three serotypes of poliovirus, to rabies virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, to West Nile virus and to the tick-borne encephalitis virus complex. Most recently we have added the seven toxins of Clostridium botulinum. Some of these will have potential utility in efforts to counteract bioterrorism and all will have immunoprophylactic and immunotherapeutic potential in the battle against emerging and re-emerging pathogens. Neutralization Assays. An impediment to understanding the immune response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been the inability to measure neutralizing antibodies because HCV does not replicate in cell culture. We previously demonstrated neutralizing antibodies in an in vivo neutralization assay utilizing chimpanzees. This has been the only accepted neutralization assay until recently, when an in vitro assay based on the neutralization of recombinant retroviruses bearing the envelope glycoproteins of HCV was developed. We demonstrated that this assay generally correlated with the in vivo assay and that the neutralizing antibodies were more broadly reactive than previously thought. We applied this knowledge to the testing of lots of commercial immune globulin that were manufactured before or after the screening of donor plasma for evidence of HCV infection and found that those lots manufactured before HCV screening contained high levels of neutralizing antibody and were not associated with hepatitis C virus infections in recipients. In contrast, immune globulins manufactured after initiation of screening for HCV lacked neutralizing antibodies and were associated with many cases of hepatitis C in recipients. This study provides, for the first time, a rational basis for passive immunoprophylaxis against hepatitis C and provides a means whereby protective neutralizing antibody can be detected and quantified. This information can be used to prepare hepatitis C immune globulin for the prevention of hepatitis C. Furthermore, for the first time, the mapping of neutralization epitopes of HCV can be facilitated by an in vitro assay. Identification of neutralization epitopes will be a key factor in developing an effective hepatitis C vaccine.',\n",
       " 'Over the past year we have pursued studies on B cells in the setting of HIV disease by focusing on 1) mechanisms of immature transitional B-cell expansion in HIV disease; 2) responses of B-cell subpopulations to stimulation with CpG-containing oligonucleotides; 3) changes in B-cell counts and subpopulations that occur following initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART); and 4) evidence of HIV-associated B-cell exhaustion in HIV-viremic individuals. In the first study addressing mechanisms of immature transitional B-cell expansion in the setting of HIV disease, we investigated changes in B-cell subpopulations that occurred in the peripheral blood of HIV-infected individuals who received IL-7 as part of a large clinical safety trial. Our findings indicate that IL-7 itself can lead to the expansion of immature transitional B cells in the peripheral blood. This is a novel observation given that a direct role for IL-7 on human B cells has never been established in vivo. In the second study, published in The Journal of Immunology, we investigated the effect of the DNA oligonucleotide CpG-B, a ligand that binds toll-like receptor 9 expressed on B cells, on the proliferation and effector function of naive and memory B cells isolated from HIV-infected individuals. Overall, our findings indicate that CpG-B, which is currently being considered as an adjuvant in vaccine preparations aimed at augmenting immune responses in immunocompromised individuals, was effective at enhancing the proliferation and secretion of immunoglobulins and cytokines of B cells isolated from HIV-viremic and HIV-aviremic individuals. While certain defects were observed in the memory B-cell compartment of HIV-viremic individuals, nave B cells from both HIV-viremic and HIV-aviremic individuals responded robustly to CpG-B, suggesting that the presence of CpG-B in vaccines could help nave B cells reach the threshold required to productively respond to immunogens. In the third study, published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, we demonstrate that the over-expression of aberrant B-cell subpopulations, including immature transitional and hyper-activated B cells, in HIV-infected individuals with active disease is reversed with effective ART. Effective ART also leads to a normalization of B-cell counts, suggesting that ongoing HIV replication is associated with a net loss of B cells, possibly through mechanisms such as increased intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis, both of which we have previously reported. In the fourth study, published in The Journal of Experimental Medicine, we describe evidence of HIV-associated B-cell exhaustion in an abnormal B-cell compartment that is expanded in the peripheral blood of HIV-infected viremic individuals. This B-cell subpopulation, termed tissue-like memory B cells as a result of their similarities with a recently described tonsillar memory B-cell subpopulation bearing immunoregulatory features, can be distinguished from other B cells by its high expression of the pan B-cell marker CD20 and low expression levels of the complement receptor CD21 and CD27, a classic marker of B-cell memory. Tissue-like memory B cells present in the blood of HIV-viremic individuals exhibit numerous signs of B-cell exhaustion, including increased expression of multiple inhibitory receptors; an altered expression of homing and adhesion receptors similar to that observed with virus-induced T-cell exhaustion; stunted in vivo replication and somatic hypermutation; reduced in vitro proliferation in response to B-cell stimuli; and enrichment of HIV-specific but not nonspecific and recall antigen-specific responses. These findings add to our understanding of why HIV-infected individuals mount a poor antibody response against HIV.',\n",
       " '1) Because IL-10 and IL-13R&#945;2 are both capable of modulating IL-13 effector functions, we examined whether the regulatory activities of IL-10 were associated with changes in IL-13R&#945;2 production and or function in schistosomiasis. We found that IL-10 inhibits granulomatous inflammation, with IL-10- - mice developing much larger granulomas in the gut and liver, but, paradoxically, displaying reduced liver fibrosis following acute Schistosoma mansoni infection. Interestingly, the reduced pathological responses in IL-10- - mice were associated with increased IL-13R&#945;2 production in the serum and liver. Therefore, to determine whether the observed changes in IL-13R&#945;2 expression were responsible for the modified pathological responses in IL-10- - mice, we generated IL-10- -IL-13R&#945;2- - double-KO (dKO) mice. We found that dKO mice developed significantly more fibrosis compared with either single-KO mouse, demonstrating that IL-13R&#945;2 cooperates with IL-10 to control Th2-driven fibrosis. To determine whether local changes in Th2 effector function were responsible for the exacerbated fibrotic responses in the dKO mice, three distinct subsets of genes were analyzed, including markers of alternative macrophage activation (Ym1 and FIZZ1), MMPs (MMP-9 and MMP-12), and interstitial collagens (COL III and COL VI), all linked with Th2 effector responses. Interestingly, deletion of IL-10 alone had little effect. However, deleting IL-13R&#945;2 alone or in combination with IL-10 led to significantly increased Ym-1, FIZZ-1, MMP-9, MMP-12, pro-Col III, and pro-Col VI mRNA expression when compared with WT mice. These data suggest that IL-13R&#945;2 is the dominant regulator of IL-13 effector responses in the tissues. In fact, the only consistent difference between IL-13R&#945;2- - and dKO mice was a slight increase in Ym-1 and MMP-9 and a small but significant increase in MMP-12 and IL-5 in the dKO mice. Thus, although -10 and IL-13R&#945;2 both regulate Th2-driven disease, they target distinct pathological features, with IL-10 inhibiting inflammation and IL-13R&#945;2 suppressing IL-13dependent effector responses (i.e. fibrosis). 2) Because the IL-4R&#945; chain functions as the primary signaling receptor for IL-4 and IL-13, it has been the most widely studied of the four receptor subunits that engage these cytokines. However, while it is now clear that the IL-4R&#945; chain plays a central role in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of Th2-associated diseases including schistosomiasis, thus far it has been impossible to assign the various functions of the IL-4R&#945; to either the Type-I or Type-II IL-4R signaling pathways, because both receptor signaling pathways are deleted in IL-4Ra-deficient animals. Therefore, to elucidate the contributions of the Type-II receptor, we generated mice with a targeted deletion of the IL13Ra1 gene and examined the effects on Th2 response development and fibrosis in schistosomiasis. Survival studies were performed with S. mansoni and as expected, by wk 10 of infection, greater than 75% of IL-4 IL-13 dKO (Type-I and Type-II receptor signaling blocked) had succumbed to the infection. In contrast, only 50% mortality was observed in the WT group by wk 18. Strikingly however, more than 80% of the IL-13R&#945;1- - mice survived through week 22, demonstrating that type-II IL-4R was highly pathogenic during S. mansoni infection, while the Type-I receptor played a protective function. The enhanced survival of the chronically infected IL-13R&#945;1- - mice was also associated with a marked reduction in fibrosis, determined by both hydroxyproline assay and by picrosirius red staining of tissue sections. In addition, markers of hepatocellular damage and biliary obstruction (alanine aminotransferase ALT, aspartate aminotransferase AST, and alkaline phosphatase AP) were also significantly decreased in the sera of chronically infected IL-13R&#945;1- - mice. Functional studies suggested that the type-II IL-4R was involved in the activation of important mesenchymal cells, like fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which contribute to the development of fibrosis and mortality in schistosomiasis. As such, these findings suggest that for some chronic fibrotic diseases, it may be advantageous to inhibit the pathogenic type-II IL-4R while leaving the protective type-I IL-4R pathway intact',\n",
       " \"This project focuses on how antigens are processed in the intestine of mice. While it is clear that the outcome of oral antigen exposure can be either positive, i.e., the development of mucosal IgA responses, and in some cases the induction of systemic immunity as well, or negative, i.e., the induction of oral tolerance, the details of why one or the other outcome occurs is complex and poorly understood. While it is known that the antigen formulation, the presence of adjuvants, and the antigen dose, as well as genetic factors, can affect mucosal immune responses, how these act to influence immunity has never been established. In prior studies we have established the presence of different antigen-presenting cell populations in the Peyer's patch (PP) and lamina propria and have detailed the surface phenotype, function, and migration of DCs in the PP using in situ immunofluorecense microscopy and in situ hybridization, flow cytometry of purified cells, and in vitro assays of cytokine production (ELISA and quantitative RT-PCR) and T cell differentiation. We determined that there are 3 separate subpopulations of immature DCs in the PP, lymphoid (CD8+), myeloid (CD11b+), and double negative (DN) Dcs that express neither CD8 or CD11b. These separated DC subpopulations are located in distinct sites in the PP, and are capable of inducing the differentiaion of T cells into cells that produce unique cytokine profiles. Most importantly, we demonstrated that PP DCs have the unique capacity to induce the differntiation of T cells that produce high levels of IL-10, a cytokine important for the IgA B cell differentiation. These studies thus are some of the first to directly demonstrate that DCs from different tissues may be unique in their ability to induce tissue specific immunity. Over the past year we have initiated studies on the role of these DC subsets in models of inflammatory bowel disease and in murine infection with reovirus, a model intestinal virus infection. We found that DN DCs in the subepithelial dome region of the PP process viral antigen from virally infected apoptotic epithelial cells.\",\n",
       " 'Vaccinia virus is a model virus for the study of the poxvirus family and forms the vaccine against smallpox. There are several membranes that envelope the vaccinia and smallpox viruses and on each membrane resides specific membrane proteins. The presence or absence of one or more membranes and its proteins leads to alternate forms of the infectious virus. Within two of these membrane forms are membrane proteins to which a vigorous immune response is mounted. We are studying two of these proteins from vaccinia with the use of biochemical techniques and the methods of x-ray crystallography. As the protein sequence similarity is very high between vaccinia and smallpox, the structures of vaccinia proteins should provide insight into the structures of proteins of the smallpox virus.',\n",
       " 'We are studying gamma delta T cell antigen receptors (TCR) and lymphocyte co-receptors with the purpose of understanding their role in the activation of an immune response. Our goal is to analyze these proteins biochemically and structurally. To do so requires that we produce sufficient amounts of protein for study and that we characterize the recombinant proteins for their appropriate functionality. Further study of their binding to ligands and of their three-dimensional structure by X-ray crystallography should lead to insights as to how these proteins function in the immune system. Unlike alpha beta T cell receptors, which recognize peptide antigens bound to major histocompatibility complex molecules, gamma delta TCRs can directly recognize antigens as intact proteins or non-peptidic compounds. About 5% of all primate peripheral blood T cells bear gamma delta TCRs, most of which recognize non-peptidic phosphorylated antigens. In earlier work, we have determined the structure of a human gamma delta TCR isolated from a T cell clone that is activated by phosphoantigens. We are now studying the binding of non-peptidic phosphorylated antigens to the gamma delta TCR using crystallographic, biochemical, and biophysical techniques. We are also studying the structure and function of several lymphocyte co-receptors.',\n",

       " 'Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is typically an early onset, fatal disease characterized by a sepsis-like illness with cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly and deficient lymphocyte cytotoxicity. Disease-causing mutations have been identified in genes encoding perforin (PRF1 FHL2), Munc13-4 (UNC13D FHL3), and syntaxin-11 (STX11 FHL4). In contrast to mutations leading to loss of perforin and Munc13-4 function, it is unclear how syntaxin-11 loss-of-function mutations contribute to disease. We have shown that freshly isolated, resting natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells express syntaxin-11. In infants, NK cells are the predominant perforincontaining cell type. NK cells from FHL4 patients fail to degranulate when encountering susceptible target cells. Interestingly, IL-2stimulation partially restores degranulation and cytotoxicity by NK cells, which could explain the less severe disease progression observed in FHL4 patients, compared to FHL2 and FHL3 patients. Since the effector T cell compartment is still immature in infants, our data suggest that the observed defect in NK cell degranulation may contribute to the pathophysiology of FHL, that evaluation of NK cell degranulation in suspected FHL patients may facilitate diagnosis, and that these new insights may offer novel therapeutic possibilities. The lymphokine interleukin (IL)-15 is essential for the development, survival, and proliferation of NK cells. A peculiar feature of stimulation by IL-15 is that expression of the alpha chain of the IL-15 receptor (IL-15Ralpha) is not required on NK cells but on other cells, such as dendritic cells, that trans-present IL-15 to the low affinity IL-15 receptor (IL-15R beta-gamma) on NK cells. Trans-presentation of IL-15 in the context of a cell-to-cell contact raises the possibility of regulation by other receptorligand interactions between the responding NK cell and the presenting cell. Does proper stimulation of NK cells by IL-15 bound to the IL-15Ralpha require additional signals from other receptors Likewise, is IL-15 trans-presentation regulated by NK cell inhibitory receptors These are important questions given the essential role of IL-15 in several facets of NK cell biology. To address the first question, the IL-15Ralpha chain has been expressed on the Drosophila insect cell line S2. The use of a cell from an evolutionary distant organism, such as the fruit fly Drosophila, has the advantage of reducing the complexity due to the many receptorligand interactions between human NK cells and mammalian target cells. Specific ligands of individual NK cell receptors can be expressed on S2 cells and tested for their ability to induce signals and functional responses in NK cells. Expression of IL-15Ralpha on insect S2 cells was sufficient to bind IL-15 and to trans-present it to NK cells. Co-expression of ICAM-1, a ligand for the adhesion receptor LFA-1, with the IL-15Ralpha did not result in greater proliferation than with the IL-15Ralpha alone. Therefore, stimulation of NK cells by trans-presented IL-15 does not require binding of other NK cell receptors to human ligands on the presenting cell. Furthermore, co-engagement of the IL-15R beta-gamma with an inhibitory receptor, through expression of MHC class I on Drosophila S2 cells, caused a reduction in the proliferation of resting NK cells. Regulation of IL-15 trans-presentation by MHC class I-specific inhibitory receptors could be an important mechanism for the termination of NK cell responses. As inflammatory conditions induce greater cell surface expression of MHC class I, one may expect down-regulation of IL-15 trans-presentation in the later phase of NK cell immune responses. Most receptors in the immune system are expressed at the surface of immune cells where they can sense the environment and induce appropriate responses, such as attraction to chemotactic signals, adhesion to other cells, and even attack of other cells that have been marked for elimination. However, a few receptors reside transiently in endosomes (e.g. growth factor receptors, toll-like receptors) from where they can transmit signals to the cell. Signaling from endosomes has emerged as a mechanism by which selected receptors provide sustained signals distinct from those generated at the plasma membrane. A receptor of the killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) family, called KIR2DL4, has the unique property of residing almost exclusively in endosomes. Unlike other KIRs that mediate inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity, KIR2DL4 triggers the production of a limited set of cytokines and chemokines, and a few other molecules. The profile of genes activated by KIR2DL4 carries a typical pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic signature. The biological context in which KIR2DL4 may provide a useful response is early pregnancy, where the KIR2DL4 ligand HLA-G is produced. The non-classical major histocompatibility class I molecule HLA-G is expressed by trophoblast cells from the fetus that invade the maternal uterus. Uterine tissue in early human pregnancy is characterized by extensive remodeling of the vasculature, invasion of fetal trophoblast cells, and by an abundance of maternal NK cells. How NKtrophoblast cell interactions influence vascular remodeling is unknown. Two major questions raised by these findings are the mechanism for transport of KIR2DL4 to endosomes, and the signaling pathway triggered by KIR2DL4 once it is bound to a soluble ligand within endosomes. By use of tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we have identified a new signaling molecule associated with KIR2DL4. We are in the process of identifying the critical steps in this pro-inflammatory signaling pathway.',\n",
       " 'Colitis is an inflammatory disease of the intestine which has traditionally been attributed to Th1-type CD4+ T cell responses. We previously established a model in which colitis can be triggered in IL-10 deficient mice or mice treated with anti-IL-10R by infection with the common intestinal bacteria Helicobacter hepaticus (Hh). Similar tissue inflammatory effects could be seen in Hh infected T cell deficient RAg mice that had received CD4+ T cells. Disease in these models was previously shown to require expression of IFN-gamma and IL-12p40, a protein that is a subunit of both IL-12 and IL-23, a cytokine which has been shown in recent years to promote autoimmune inflammation. By studying mice deficient in either p35 (the chain which pairs with p40 to make IL-12) or p19 (the chain which pairs with p40 to make IL-23) we established that IL-23, not IL-12 is the critical cytokine in Hh induced colitis. IL-23 is thought to promote inflammation by triggering the cytokine IL-17 from CD4+T cells (Th17 cells)and indeed high levels of IL-17 were detected in colitic tissues. Neverthless, IFN-gamma was also detected and shown to play a major role in the induction of disease in the Hh model. Thus, these studies support a dual contribution of both IL-17 and IFN-gamma in inflammatory bowel disease and indicate that IL-23 not IL-12 should be targeted in anti-cytokine therapeutic approachs to treating this important chronic ailment. An ongoing interest of our group concerns the mechanisms by which the innate immune system senses and responds to mycobacterial infection. Our previous studies along with those of other groups have established the involvement of host Toll-like receptors (TLR) and in particular TLR2 and TLR9 working in synergy in this process. Dectin-1 is a fungal pattern recognition receptor that binds to beta-glucans and triggers cytokine production by facilitating interaction with TLR2 or by directly activating spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). To assess the possible role of Dectin-1 in the innate response to mycobacteria, we used an in vitro system in which IL-12p40 production is measured in splenic dendritic cells (SpDC) following exposure to live Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli. Treatment of SpDC with laminarin or glucan phosphate, two molecules known to block Dectin-1-dependent activity, led to a reduction in M. tuberculosis-induced IL-12p40 as well as IL-12p70 production. Moreover, SpDC from Dectin-1(- -) chimeric mice displayed reduced IL-12p40 production in response to mycobacteria when compared with Dectin-sufficient DC. Laminarin treatment also inhibited mycobacterial-induced IL-12p40 production in DC from TLR2(- -) mice, arguing that Dectin-1 functions independently of TLR2 signaling in this system. Importantly, a Dectin-1 fusion protein was found to directly bind to live mycobacteria in a laminarin-inhibitable manner indicating the presence of ligands for the receptor in the bacterium and laminarin pretreatment resulted in reduced association of mycobacteria to SpDC. In additional experiments, mycobacterial stimulation was shown to be associated with increased phosphorylation of Syk and this response was inhibited by laminarin. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of Syk reduced the M. tuberculosis-induced IL-12p40 response. Together, these findings support a role for Dectin-1 in promoting M. tuberculosis-induced IL-12p40 production by DC in which the receptor augments bacterial-host cell interaction and enhances the subsequent cytokine response through an unknown mechanism involving Syk signaling.',\n",
       " 'Iron is essential for cell growth and division, but it is also harmful when it accumulates in cells. Therefore, the intracellular level of iron must be precisely regulated. Iron-overload diseases are primarily caused by hereditary hemochromatosis (HH)-the most common genetic disorder in Europe and the United States. The well studied pathways for regulated iron uptake and storage are mediated by the transferrin transferrin receptor complex and by the storage protein, ferritin, respectively. However, it appears that novel proteins can regulate iron metabolism by interaction with the transferrin transferrin receptor complex and with other proteins involved in transferrin-independent iron-uptake pathways. Recently, the gene responsible for HH was cloned and characterized as a novel major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like gene (HFE) that is distinguishable from the wild type by a single mutation that prevents its transport to the cell surface. The HFE protein is known to regulate iron uptake possibly by interaction with the transferrin receptor. HFE transcripts are not detected in resting lymphocytes, but are present at high levels in human tumor cells, especially those of lymphoid origin, implying that HFE may play a role in tumorigenesis. In order to define the role of HFE in iron-homeostasis and to determine if interferences with its normal expression play a role in diseases such as cancer, we propose (a) to characterize cellular proteins that interact with HFE, (b) to investigate the intracellular trafficking of HFE and its complexes, and (c) to determine how extracellular factors (e.g. iron, cytokines, viral infections) as well as intracellular factors (e.g. chaperones, heat shock proteins, viral proteins) regulate the trafficking and or recycling of HFE complexes. Ultimately, by determining just how the HFE molecule functions to aid the growth of cancer cells, we hopefully will be able to develop drugs that interfere with the process and result in cancer cell death. Due to its specific binding to transferrin receptor, our recent studies suggest that it may be possible to exploit soluble HFE as a specific vector for the intracellular delivery of drugs.',\n",
       " 'We have used both in vitro cell culture systems and non-human primate ocular infection models to better understand chlamydial pathogenesis. These studies have identified chlamydial induced host proteins that are tyrosine phosphorylated in a strain specific manner that implicate differences in chlamydial co-receptor usage during pathogen entry. We also have identified by functional comparative genomic studies of trachoma strains a small subset of genes that correlate with chlamydial strain pathogenic diversity. Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen of humans that exhibits species-specific biological characteristics in its early interactions with host cells that are likely important to pathogenesis. One such characteristic is the tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-P) of a circa 70 kDa polypeptide that occurs only following infection of mammalian cells by human isolates strains. We sought to identify this protein because of its potential significance to the pathogenesis of human chlamydial infections. Using an immunoproteomic approach we identified the host protein ezrin, a member of the ezrin radixin moesin (ERM) protein family that serves as a physical link between host cell receptors and the actin cytoskeleton. Confocal microscopy studies showed colocalization of ezrin and actin at the tips and crypts of microvilli, the site of chlamydial attachment and entry, respectively. To demonstrate a functional role for ezrin, we infected cells with a dominant negative (DN) ezrin phenotype, or treated cells with ezrin-specific siRNA. We found that both DN and siRNA-treated cells were significantly less susceptible to infection by human chlamydial strains. Moreover, we demonstrated that inhibition of infection in ezrin DN cells occurred at the stage of chlamydial entry. We hypothesize that the C. trachomatis-specific Tyr-P of ezrin might relate to an undefined species-specific mechanism of pathogen entry that involves chlamydial specific ligand(s) and host cell co-receptor usage. Chlamydia trachomatis is the etiological agent of trachoma, the leading cause of preventable blindness. Trachoma presents distinct clinical syndromes ranging from mild and self-limiting to severe inflammatory disease. The underlying host and pathogen factors responsible for these diverse clinical outcomes are unclear. To assess the role of pathogen variation in disease outcome we analyzed the genomes of four trachoma strains representative of the three major trachoma serotypes using microarray based comparative genome sequencing. Outside of ompA trachoma strains differed primarily in a very small subset (twenty-two) of genes. These subtle genetic variations were manifested in profound differences in virulence as measured by in vitro growth rate, burst size, plaque morphology, and interferon-gamma sensitivity but most importantly in virulence as shown by ocular infection of non-human primates. These findings are the first to identify genes that correlate with different trachoma strain pathogenicities.',\n",
       " \"Seizures are the most common clinical manifestation of cerebral cysticercosis and occur in the presence of viable, dying, and calcified or non-calcified dead cysts. How calcified cysts provoke seizures is not known but recent observations demonstrated edema around some calcified lesions at the time of seizure activity and disappearance during periods when seizures were not occurring. Edema associated with foci in idiopathic epilepsy is highly unusual so that this observation suggests that the mechanism(s) associated with calcified cysts is unique. Documenting and understanding this phenomenon is important for a number of reasons. First, although by definition these lesions are inactive, e.g., not living larvae and do not require anti-parasitic treatment, they are frequently mistaken for active lesions and patients undergo unnecessary treatment. Second, a likely reason for perilesional edema is intermittent antigen release and subsequent host immune response resulting in inflammation and edema. If proven, then the treatment for this would not only involve suppression of seizure activity with anti- seizure medication, but also the use of anti-inflammatory medications such as corticosteroids. A study was initiated in Peru to determine 1) the frequency of perilesional edema around calcifications 2) the frequency of associated symptoms 3) what lesions and patients have a propensity to undergo this phenomenon 4) the natural history of perilesional edema and 5) whether treatment of patients with perilesional edema with corticosteroids results in enhanced regression of edema and clinical benefit. During accrual of patients to perform the above study, a baseline MRI was obtained in patients with or without current symptoms. A prospective study of patients with a history of seizures and only calcific neurocysticercosis is on going in Peru and accrual of patients is continuing. Preliminary analysis showed that approximately 23.4% of prospectively followed patients with only calcifications and a history of seizures have had a seizure after about 3 years of follow-up. 50.0% of those with seizure have had perilesional edema. This suggests that seizures are relatively common in this population and perilesional edema is caused or associated with about one-half of the episodes. The treatment arm of the study was stopped because there was no statistical way to show benefit of corticosteroids. Accural was stopped in this study but study patients are still being followed. A new treatment protocol for neurocysticercosis began enrolling patients in Lima, Peru. The purpose of the protocol is to determine if enhanced dosing of corticosteroids for one month with a two week taper decreases seizure frequency compared to 10 days of corticosteroids in albendazole treated patients with intraparenchymal cysticercosis without an unacceptable increase in side effects or a decrease in treatment efficacy. Much of the pathology and subsequently symptoms caused by cysticercosis are due to the host's immune response to the parasite that causes inflammation, seizures or focal neurological deficits. This leads to cyst degeneration, granuloma formation and or calcification. The cysticidal agents, albendazole and praziquantel, initiate a similar process and until recently it was unclear if clinical benefit occurred with treatment. A recent double blinded randomized treatment sudy showed a clear benefit of treatment compared to no treatment . Although an overall decrease in generalized seizures was found after treatment with a standard regimen of albendazole and 6 mg dexamethasone day for 10 days, a relative increase in seizures in the first month compared to later time periods suggested that inflammation was inadequately suppressed. Exactly what is the best way to suppress treatment-induced inflammation has not been studied and therefore is not known. The current protocol is an open label controlled study comparingg the previous dexamethasone dosing of 10 days of 6 mg day of dexamethasone with an enhanced dosing of 4 weeks of 8 mg day with a 2 week taper. Albendazole dosing of both groups is identical. The primary end point is the number of seizures at specific time periods over the subsequent year, the number and severity of side effects and cure rates at 1 year. Collaborative studies with Dr. Mahanty have been started to study the immune responses to cestodes that occur during the natural course of disease and also after treatment with the cysticidal agents albendazole and praziquantel. In cysticercosis the treatment of viable cysts many times initiates a vigorous immune response that appears similar if not identical to the type of inflammation found during the course of the natural infection. Seizures and other symptoms are common during treatment. Consequently, the problem in treatment is how to minimize symptoms and long-term damage due to treatment without preventing or inhibiting evolution to a relatively less destructive and less symptomatic granuloma. This question cannot be readily studied in humans. Therefore, studies using the cestode T. crassiceps infection in mice have been initiated to answer this and other questions.\",\n",
       " 'Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic yeast which belongs to Basidiomycetes, a taxonomic Class phylogenetically remote from the rest of the pathogenic yeasts (Ascomycetes). C. neoformans causes fatal meningoencephalitis primarily in patients with T- lymphocyte dysfunction and is the only species in the genus Cryptococcus that has optimum growth at temperatures higher than 30C. Although extensive studies on the molecular basis of cell cycle and morphogenesis have been carried out in ascomycetous yeasts, such studies have not been conducted in C. neoformans. This project was initiated to study the molecular genetics of cell cycle associated genes in C. neoformans. In 2003, we reported the function of the gene CCN1 which was necessary for cell growth at 37C. During 2004-2005,we studied the effect of TUP1 deletion on the biology of MATa and MATalpha strains in serotype D. TUP1 is a global regulator, which is known to control morphogenesis in many ascomycetous fungi. Interestingly, tup1 mutants manifested quorum sensing (QS) and at growth temperatures that allow QS function, it differed between MATa and MATalpha strains. An 11-mer peptide secreted in the growth medium of tup1 mutant was identified as the quorum sensing molecule. Fungal QS factors reported thus far have been alcohols such as tyrosol or farnesol but a peptide has never been reported as a QS factor in the Kingdom Fungi.During 2005-2006, we deleted TUP1 from a serotype A strain of C. neoformans which differs from serotype D strains in capsular antigenicity and the function of various genes. Unlike in serotype D strains, tup1 deletion in H99 caused no quorum sensning-like phenotype but the growth on complex media was clearly retarded compared to the wild type. Tup1 ko strain of serotype A showed a drastic increas in capsule formation and when the tup1 ko strains were complemented with the wild type TUP1 gene, the capsule size decreased significantly compared to the tup1 ko strains. These findings indicate that TUP1 represses capsule formation in vitro. The capsule size in vivo, however, was not affected by TUP1 deletion. Mice infected with the tup1 ko strain survived much longer than either the wild type or the tup1 ko strain complemented with the TUP1 gene. This gene is the first, thus far, known to regulate capsule formation in C. neoformans.',\n",
       " 'Mast cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic diseases. These reactions are generally initiated by antigen-dependent aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc-epsilon-RI) expressed on the cell surface and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. histamine, prostanoids, proteases and cytokines). However, we have demonstrated that ligands for other receptors such as Kit may serve to prime mast cells for, or act as co-activators of, antigen-mediated mast cell activation. The signaling pathways linking Fc-epsilon-RI aggregation to human mast cell activation and function and how other receptors modify these Fc-mediated signaling events is unclear. Thus the primary focus of the research is the elucidation of signaling mechanisms associated with the activation of mast cells via the Fc-epsilon-RI and especially how the signaling pathways initiated by other receptors may integrate with those initiated by the Fc-epsilon-RI for synergistic mast cell activation and or inhibition. We have observed that Fc-epsilon-RI, Fc-gamma-RI, and Kit mediated unique and convergent signals for the release of inflammatory mediators from human mast cells. This allows not only similarities and differences in the mediators released by the aggregation of Fc-epsilon-RI and Fc-gamma-RI but also allows Kit to enhance Fc-epsilon-RI mediated responses without inducing degranulation on its own. Recent studies have focused on the roles of PI 3-kinase, the adaptor molecule, NTAL, and the tyrosine kinase Btk in these evenets. The studies conducted in human mast cells have recently been expanded to look at the roles of specific molecules in the activation of mast cells derived from the bone marrow of knock out transgenic mice in combination with siRNA and shRNA approaches in both human and mouse mast cells.',\n",
       " 'For the past several years, we have been investigating the role of latently infected, resting CD4+ T cells and persistent viral replication in the pathogenesis of HIV disease and the impact of this reservoir on the treatment of HIV-infected individuals. We previously demonstrated that the latent viral reservoir in the resting CD4+ T cell compartment persists in virtually all infected individuals receiving effective antiviral therapy. Consequently, this viral reservoir is a major impediment to the eradication of HIV in vivo. In addition, we realized that HIV continually replicates at low levels in chronically infected individuals who receive effective antiviral therapy that renders them consistently aviremic for prolonged periods of time. Over the past year, we have focused our research on: 1) delineation of the mechanism by which HIV persists in infected individuals receiving effective antiviral therapy for extended periods of time and 2) investigation of the dynamics of decay of viral reservoirs in infected individuals who initiate antiretroviral therapy at different stages of disease. First, we investigated the presence and status of residual HIV in individuals who had received effective antiretroviral therapy for prolonged periods of time and examined the underlying mechanisms by which HIV persists in CD4+ T cells of such individuals. We demonstrated that CD4+ T cells in the gut-associate lymphoid tissue (GALT) carried the highest level of HIV proviral DNA compared to CD4+ T cells in the blood of infected individuals receiving effective antiretroviral therapy for prolonged periods of time. Phylogenetic analyses of HIV env sequences revealed active cross-infection between blood- and GALT-associated CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, our data also suggest that intensification of antiretroviral therapy, especially through the addition of newer classes of anti-HIV drugs, will be necessary to contain low levels of on-going viral replication in the tissue compartment of chronically infected individuals in order to achieve complete clearance of virus in vivo. Second, we investigated the dynamics of decay of viral reservoirs in infected individuals who initiated antiretroviral therapy at different stages of disease. In a cross-sectional study, we demonstrated that the median copy number of HIV proviral DNA in subjects who initiated antiretroviral therapy within 6 months of infection was significantly lower compared to subjects initiating antiretroviral therapy during the chronic phase of infection (p=0.003). In order to examine the frequency of CD4+ T cells carrying infectious virus, a High Input Co-culture assay, which allows examination of large numbers of cells, was conducted using highly enriched CD4+ T cells from 8 infected individuals in whom no measurable HIV proviral DNA had been detected in their cells. The frequency of cells carrying infectious virus in HIV-infected individuals who initiated therapy within 6 months of infection was significantly lower compared to HIV-infected individuals who initiated therapy during the chronic phase of infection (p=0.03). Remarkably, no infectious virus could be recovered from the peripheral blood or GALT CD4+ T cells of one infected individual (<1 infected cell per 0.8x109 CD4+ T cells) in whom antiretroviral therapy was initiated early in infection. Our data suggest that the combination of initiation of antiretroviral therapy early in the course of HIV infection and prolonged suppression of viral replication can result in a profound diminution of HIV reservoirs that may lead to clearance of virus in infected individuals.',\n",
       " 'CD64, also known as the type I Fc-gamma receptor, functions as a high affinity receptor for IgG. It is involved in the activation of phagocytosis, endocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles, and activation of the complement system. Our goal is to determine the structure of CD64 and its complex with immunoglobulins. To express and purify the recombinant CD64 protein, we have constructed both bacteria and a CHO cell based expression system. The yield of the CHO cell expression remained at a level of 50 ug liter of cell culture after gene amplification. The bacteria system, on the other hand, yielded the protein in an inactive inclusion body form. Subsequent refolding experiments resulted in less than a mg of the protein for crystallization. Currently, we are attempting to express the recombinant CD64 using a baculovirus expression system. B cells initiate their signaling through the formation of antigen cross-linked B cell receptor (BCR) which consists of an immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule and Ig alpha (Iga) and Ig beta (Igb). In efforts to elucidate the interaction between Iga and Igb and between the heterodimer and the BCR, we have expressed the extracellular domains of Iga and Igb in E. coli as inclusion bodies. Each protein was encoded in a pET-30 vector and included a C-terminal 6-His tag for purification, and high yields of both Iga and Igb inclusion bodies were obtained (15-50 mg L of culture). Attempts were made to refold Iga and Igb either individually or in concert. Refolding of Iga alone yielded approximately 2 mg of pure protein from 50 mg of inclusion bodies following purification by Ni-NTA and gel filtration chromatography. The purified protein was present as a mixture of monomeric and homodimeric Iga as determined by mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE analysis; the Iga-Iga dimer was most likely noncovalent. Purified Iga was used for antibody production and was also subjected to crystallization trials. However, the sample appeared to be unstable, precipitating above 4C, and no hits were obtained with crystallization screens. Refolding of Igb alone failed to yield significant quantities of protein due to degradation. Initial attempts to co-refold Iga and Igb together by standard dilution refolding methods were also plagued by degradation of Igb. However, by sequestering Iga and Igb inclusion bodies together in a smaller volume during refolding, we purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and anion exchange a mixture of monomeric and dimeric Iga, and the Iga-Igb heterodimer.',\n",
       " 'Identification of the components, targets, and magnitude of an effective immune response to HIV are important steps toward the development of effective vaccines or immunotherapies. Although patients with normal CD4+ T cell counts and low levels of plasma virus are a heterogeneous group, a small subgroup of patients with truly non-progressive HIV infection and restriction of virus replication likely hold important clues to the basis of an effective immune response to HIV. A small subpopulation (fewer than 0.8% of HIV infected individuals) shows no signs of progression over a 10 year period. We have assembled a unique cohort of such patients with non-progressive disease termed long-term nonprogressors(LTNP). Many of these patients have been infected for 20 years in the absence of antiretroviral therapy with no CD4+ T cell decline, and plasma viral RNA below 50 copies per milliliter. Cells from these patients are being used to systematically dissect the mechanisms of immune mediated restriction of virus replication. HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses of these patients have been studied by a combination of standard cytotoxic T cell (CTL) assays, flow cytometric assays, and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis in comparison with patients with progressive disease. HLA typing revealed a dramatic association between the HLA B*5701 class I allele and nonprogressive infection (88% (15 of 17) vs 9.5% (19 of 200) in progressors). The gag-specific CD8+ T cell response in the LTNP group was highly focused on peptides previously shown to be B57 restricted. These findings indicated that within this phenotypically and genotypically distinct cohort, a host immune factor is highly associated with restriction of virus replication and nonprogressive disease. They also strongly suggested a mechanism of virus specific immunity that directly operates through the B5701 molecule. Very high frequencies (0.8-18.0%) of circulating CD8+ T cells were found to be HIV specific. However, high frequencies of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells were not limited to LTNP with restriction of plasma virus. We have also observed that high frequencies of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells capable of recognizing autologous virus variants persist in LTNP and progressors. Thus, the greater ability of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells of LTNP to restrict HIV replicaiton could not be attributed to differences in CD8+ T cell frequency, specificity, ability to activate, ability to produce cytokines or ability to recognize autologous viral variants. Taken together, these data suggested that other qualitative properties of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells may distinguish the response of LTNP from those of progressors. We have recently observed that LTNP are distinguished by the maintenance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells with a high proliferative capacity. This proliferation is coupled to or parallels perforin expression. By comparison, the HIV-specific CD8+ T cells of progressors had a limited proliferative capacity, limited ability to upregulate perforin expression, and accumulated in early G1 of the cell cycle. These results indicate that LTNP are differentiated by increased proliferative capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells linked to enhanced effector function. In addition, the relative absence of these functions in progressors may represent a mechanism by which HIV avoids immunological control. Strong HIV specific CD4+ T cell proliferative responses are demonstrable in these LTNP patients. However, they are not demonstrable in the majority of infected patients with progressive disease. It has been presumed that HIV-specific CD4+ T cells are killed upon encountering antigen and maintenance of CD4+ T cell responses in some patients causes the restriction of virus replication. We have recently shown that although proliferative responses were absent in patients with poorly restricted virus replication, HIV-specific CD4+ T cells capable of producing inteerferon-gamma were detected. In two separate cohorts of 8 and 15 patients, interruption of antiretroviral therapy resulted in the rapid and complete abrogation of virus-specific proliferation although HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cells were present in the peripheral blood during viremia. Diminished HIV-specific proliferative responses were associated with diminished production of IL-2 by HIV-specific CD4+ T cells. Further, HIV-specific CD4+ T cells of viremic patients could be induced to proliferate in response to HIV antigens when co-stimulation was provided by either anti-CD28 antibody or IL-2 in vitro. In 12 of 15 patients, HIV replication was not controlled below 5,000 copies per milliliter of plasma for greater than 12 weeks. Thus, HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cells persist but do not proliferate in viremic patients. These cells retain the ability to activate, produce cytokine, and are not replicatively senescent. Taken together, these cross-sectional and longitudinal data suggest the absence of HIV-specific proliferative responses in most untreated patients does not represent a critical defect that permits poorly restricted HIV replication, but rather is a consequence of viremia. These findings raise a number of fundamental issues for the potential use of the T cell response to HIV in prophylactic vaccines or immunotherapies. Because most individuals fail to restrict HIV replication despite a broad, high frequency CD8+ T cell response, simply stimulating a high frequency response via a therapeutic or prophylactic vaccine will not necessarily result in durable immunologic control. Thus, it is unclear whether CD8+ T cells can be sufficiently primed such that qualitative changes in the CD8+ T cell response can be avoided. In addition, it is unclear how long after HIV infection of vaccinees these qualitative changes might occur and immunologic restriction of viral replication is lost. Further, it is unclear whether these qualitative changes can be reversed in infected individuals. A deeper understanding of the basis of immunologic control in LTNP and the loss of immunologic control in progressors is likely to provide information that is critical for use of the cellular immune response in each of these settings.',\n",
       " 'Herpes Zoster (HZ) is estimated to affect between 600,000 to 1 million people annually in the United States. The incidence and severity of HZ, as well as the frequency and severity of its complications, increase markedly with age. Antiviral therapy has modest impact on the acute phase of HZ. However, it does not appear to prevent post herpetic neuralgia, the most common complication of HZ. During the past decade studies have revealed a close temporal relation between the age-related increase in the incidence and severity of HZ and an age-related decline in cell mediated immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The administration of a live attenuated varicella-zoster vaccine to older adults results in a marked and long lasting increase in VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity. We hypothesize that by boosting VZV-specific cellular immune responses, the incidence and severity of HZ and its complications can be reduced. Named the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS), this major clinical research study is a five-year, nationwide trial being conducted at 22 study sites, and enrolled a total of 38,546 volunteers. Of these individuals, 1,741 were vaccinated at the NIH Clinical Center. The enrollment period lasted from November 1998 to July 2001. At our site, the study received IRB approval on 5 3 99 and the first patient was enrolled on 6 15 99. Reactions to the vaccine were monitored passively by phone and actively in a 6000-subject subset. Surveillance of the enrollees was performed by a monthly automatic phone system. Patients reporting a zoster-like illness (either into this system or by calling directly) are examined and tested for VZV. The study is now closed and the database is being prepared for analysis. We hope to have the results available by early next year. An ammendment to continue follow up of subjects until results are available have been submitted to the IRB. The objectives of this amendment are (1) to continue the follow-up of a subset of subjects in the main efficacy study in order to accrue additional information on the persistence of vaccine efficacy during the interim period between the efficacy study close-out and the completion of the data analysis; and (2) to preserve a subset of the main efficacy study cohort during this interim period to facilitate the initiation of a long-term vaccine efficacy persistence study, should one be implemented.',\n",
       " 'Hematopoietic neoplasms of mice have long been used as models of human malignancies even though histologic and pathogenetic parallels have often been less than well established. In mice, high level expression of murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) from germline endogenous ecotropic viruses is associated in some strains (AKR, C58) with development of thymic T cell lymphomas in almost all mice. Remarkably, high-level virus expression from the same loci but on a different genetic background (NFS congenics, termed NFS.V+) is associated with an 80% incidence of B cell lineage lymphomas. T cell lymphomas are associated with the development of pathogenic recombinant mink cell focus- inducing (MCF) viruses while MCF viruses formed during the process of B cell transformation appear to be non-pathogenic. Histologic, phenotypic and molecular characterization of these mouse B lymphomas showed that some are strikingly similar to subsets of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) of humans but that other subsets of NHL do not appear to occur spontaneously in mice. Understandings of the molecular pathogenesis of human NHL have been advanced by the uncovering of links between cytogenetic aberrations, primarily translocations effecting activation of oncogenes - and histopathologic and immunophenotypic presentations of specific tumor types. Studies of mice have linked proviral insertional mutagenesis rather than translocations of oncogenes with lymphomas but associations of particular integration sites with specific subtypes have not been described. Studies in LIP have advanced opportunities to relate the pathogenesis of mouse and human lymphomas by defining parallels among small lymphocytic, marginal zone (MZL) and subsets of diffuse large cell lymphomas (DLCL). These lymphoma types were observed in both NFS.V+ and AKXD recombinant inbred strains but in differing proportions. One subset of DLCL was found to exhibit translocations involving BCL6, a gene implicated in the development of human DLCL. Another subset was characterized by the presence of high proportions of histiocytes providing a homologue for human histiocyte rich DLCL. All lymphoma types seen in NFS.V+ mice were also seen in virus-negative segregants from a cross with NFS but with longer latencies. Ecotropic virus expression thus seems to act to accelerate the appearance of lymphomas on the NFS background. The importance and potential complexities involved in unraveling the role of MuLV in lymphomagenesis were further highlighted in a study of proviral integrations in lymphomas of AKXD and NFS congenic mice that identified more than a hundred new common integration sites and a series of putative proto-oncogenes. Heightened expression of Gfi1 was foudn to be specifically associated with the development of mouse splenic marginal zone B cell lymphomas. Correlations of histologic, phenotypic and molecular characteristics of mouse leukemias and lymphomas permitteed the development of a consensus nomenclature for these malignancies. These classification systems will provide the foundation for further studies of spontaneous diseases and those modeled through the use of transgenic and knockout mice and for increased underatanding of normal B cell differentiation.Studies of diffuse large B cell lymphoma identified ICSBP as a distinguishing gene. High expression in this lymphomma subset was shown to be realted to high level expression in normal human and mouse centroblasts.ICSBP appears to regulate a series of gene critical to germinal center formation and development in humans and mice.',\n",
       " 'CTCF is a highly conserved, multi-functional nuclear factor involved in many aspects of gene regulation ranging from gene activation or repression to enhancer blocking and hormone regulated silencing. CTCF-proteins in many species, including Drosophila, have similar size and contain central highly conserved 11 Zn-finger DNA-binding domain that mediates multiple sequence-specificity of DNA binding flanked by N- and C-terminal fragments of roughly equal size. By making inter- and intra-chromosomal loops through selective interactions between various DNA-bound CTCF molecules at different genomic targets, CTCF can act as a universal and versatile component of chromatin-insulators and boundaries for spreading of nucleosome modifications, of non-coding intergenic transcripts, and of bi- and or mono- allelic regional DNA methylation. It can also function as a promoter-proximal repressor or activator. Depending on the context, CTCF may also couple DNA-looping with activity of transcriptional enhancers. Genome-wide in-vivo mapping of tens of thousands of DNA CTCF-complexes showed that CTCF can position nucleosomes around nuclease hypersensitive sites that landmark insulators, enhancers, and other regulatory sequences. The featuring of so many functions suggested that CTCF has important interacting partners (ranging from B23 nucleophosmin to YY1 and cohesins) and that it is an essential factor. Indeed, CTCF knockout in mice is lethal at early stages of embryo development. However, expression of ectopic CTCF results in a profound negative regulation of proliferation, indicating that CTCF may be a tumor suppressor gene (TSG). Human CTCF maps within 16q22 region of recurrent LOH in many tumors. Accordingly, several functional point mutations in the 11ZF DBD of CTCF have been characterized in tumors selected for the loss of the second CTCF allele. Given the importance of CTCF for development, cell proliferation, etc., we not only analyzed genome wide CTCF targets for the first time (Kim TH, Abdullaev ZK, Smith AD, et al., Cell 2007, vol. 128, pp1231-1245) but also studied the in vivo roles of CTCF in adult tissues and during embryonic development. We depleted maternal stores of CTCF from growing mouse oocytes using transgenic RNAi technology, and identified hundreds of misregulated genes. Moreover, our analysis suggests that CTCF predominantly activates or derepresses transcription in oocytes. CTCF depletion causes meiotic defects in the egg, and mitotic defects in the embryo that are accompanied by defects in zygotic gene expression, and culminate in apoptosis. Maternal pronuclear transfer and CTCF mRNA microinjection experiments indicate that CTCF is a mammalian maternal effect gene, and that persistent transcriptional defects rather than persistent chromosomal defects perturb early embryonic development. This is the first study detailing a global and essential role for CTCF in mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos (Wan LB, Pan H, Hannenhalli S, et.al., Development 2008 vol.135, pp. 2729-2738). We also detailed hTERT up-regulation by methylation of the first exon CTCF methylation sensitive repressive site. We showed that in many cancers as well as in the reporter system methylation of exon 1 CTCF site results in activation of hTERT gene.This observation was rather unexpected as usually DNA methylation is associated with gene inactivation (Renaud S, Loukinov D, Abdullaev Z, et. al., Nucleic Acids Res 2007 vol. 35, pp.1245-56). Finally, we discovered role of CTCF as repressor of all three promoters of human BORIS gene. We showed that blocking of CTCF in normal cells results in demethylation and derepression of BORIS promoters. We identified a number of CTCF sites in 5non-coding region of BORIS gene. Our results provide a basis for understanding of functional connection between a lessening of the strictness of BORIS silencing in somatic cells with haploinsufficiency of CTCF observed in cancers.

       " 'Although combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been successful in suppressing plasma HIV RNA levels in infected patients, it has not resulted in eradication of virus. It is now clear that prolonged, continuous ART results in significant toxicities and adherence to drug regimens is difficult. In addition, the cost of HAART drugs is prohibitive for many countries and individuals. Therefore, we have studied the virologic and immunologic effects of intermittent versus continuous ART in HIV-infected individuals in an attempt to reduce the total time an individual received therapy while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. Ongoing studies include a randomized, controlled trial of long cycle intermittent ART (1 month off ART followed by 2 months on ART for 22months), pilot studies of short cycle intermittent ART (7 days off ART followed by 7 days on ART for up to 52 months) and randomized, controlled trials in the U.S. and Uganda of short cycle intermittent versus continuous ART for the treatment of chronic HIV infection. Following 4-7 cycles of long cycle intermittent therapy, 19 of 22 patients had detectable plasma viremia after each of the 1 month off-drug periods. There was no significant difference in the mean plasma HIV RNA level between the 1st and the 4th cycles off drugs. However, all patients had a viral load of < 500 copies ml following each of the 2 months on-drug periods; 70% of patients had plasma HIV RNA of < 50 copies ml after the on-ART periods. A comprehensive evaluation of this patient cohort demonstrated a lack of clear therapeutic benefit in terms of virologic and immunologic effects, as well as of multiple parameters of toxicity, in individuals who received at least 48 weeks of long-cycle intermittent therapy. More importantly, efavirenz, and other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors cannot be recommended for use in long cycle intermittent ART strategies due to the increased risk of developing resistance to these agents. In a previous study, we demonstrated that patients receiving short cycle intermittent therapy (7 days on ART with a dual protease inhibitor-based, twice per day regimen followed by 7 days off) maintained suppression of plasma HIV viremia while reducing serum lipid levels. However, adherence to a twice-a-day regimen is difficult. Thus, we investigated a proof-of concept study consisting of short cycle intermittent ART with once per day regimen of didanosine, lamivudine and efavirenz in chronically infected patients. Seven of 8 patients evaluated maintained suppression of plasma HIV RNA for 60-84 weeks (30-42 cycles) while preserving CD4+ T cell counts. In addition, there was no evidence for the emergence of drug resistance to antiretroviral drugs. We are currently evaluating whether viral evolution occurs in these patients despite levels of plasma viremia below the limit of detection. Our goal in this study is to assess the effect of short-cycle antiretroviral therapy versus continuous ART at the genetic level of the virus in order to further demonstrate the safety and efficacy of short-cycle therapy. It is important to note that the need for strict adherence to a short-cycle intermittent ART regimen is necessary and the feasibility of this approach will require randomized, controlled clinical trials. In this regard, we are conducting a randomized, controlled trial of two short cycle intermittent therapy approaches versus continuous ART in Kampala, Uganda. In summary, short cycle intermittent ART may offer new hope for the treatment of HIV infection by reducing cost and possibly toxicities while potentially enhancing adherence. If safety and efficacy of short-cycle intermittent therapy is ultimately demonstrated in clinical settings, it might prove to be an important strategy to expand therapy in resource-limited settings.',\n",
       " 'Although now almost two decades of advances in the development and refinement of antiretroviral therapy have substantially diminished HIV-associated illness and mortality, the chronic management of HIV-infected patients remains complex. Both the acute and long-term toxicities of an expanding armamentarium of antiretroviral medications are becoming better understood and continue to complicate the successful management of this infection. Alternative treatment strategies are still clearly desirable, both for patients with access to ART and, on a worldwide basis, for the much greater number of patients with limited access to these expensive therapies. Our clinical research continues to address several important aspects of the following questions: how to optimally use and administer multi-class combination anti-retroviral therapy; how to integrate immune based therapies within a framework of ongoing antiretroviral therapy; how to develop a successful antiretroviral strategy that permits safe, periodic interruption of treatment in order to spare drug and or reduce toxicities, and how to optimize the potential use of immune-based therapies as a means of decreasing exposure to antiretroviral drugs. A major highlight of this project has been to characterize the immunologic abnormalities associated with HIV infection, develop safe, practical immunologic approaches to the adjunctive therapy of patients with HIV infection, and utilize these immune based therapies as tools for obtaining valuable insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms present in patients with HIV infection. One of the specific tools employed in this endeavor has been the use of subcutaneous administration of interleukin-2 (scIL-2) to reverse the CD4+ T cell decline associated with progressive HIV-1 infection. A series of randomized phase I-II studies were carried out that established this as a feasible method for increasing the CD4 count in patients with HIV infection; these studies were then extended to optimize the dosing regimens for maximal immunologic and virologic benefit while minimizing side effects. Intensive efforts are underway to better characterize the function, replication, and survival of lymphocytes following both acute and chronic stimulation by IL-2 therapy. Cohorts of patients are being followed who have received IL-2 treatment for periods that now extend to almost 16 years. A major finding of these studies, elucidated using two independent means of both in vivo and ex vivo lymphocyte labeling, has been the discovery that intermittent IL-2 therapy induces a marked prolongation of the survival of CD4+ T cell subsets, particularly both naive and central memory cell subsets. Extensive phenotypic study of these CD4+ CD25+ cytokine-expanded cells (CEN) shows them to express a unique pattern of surface markers distinguishable from other CD25+ populations such as T regulatory lymphocytes. The laboratory remains engaged in an extensive series of collaborations with a large number of extramural colleagues, both in the US and abroad, in the context of two major randomized phase III international clinical endpoint trials of sc IL-2. The goal of these studies is to determine whether the favorable effects of IL-2 therapy on CD4+ T cell number translate into a significant delay in the onset of AIDS-defining conditions and or death in such patients versus the recipients of antiretroviral therapy alone. We have also served as lead center in a multi-center exploration of the safety and potential immunologic efficacy of an interleukin-2 analogue that has a selectively enhanced binding affinity for the high-affinity IL-2 receptor and a more favorable toxicity profile in preclinical studies. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is also being studied for its potential role in supplementing ART therapy, specifically to determine whether it can be used as a ART-sparing regimen for those who experience an initial CD4+ T cell increase from its use. We have conducted a randomized, controlled trial of scIL-2 with and without ART interruption in an IL-2-experienced cohort to determine how successful IL-2 therapy may be in eliminating the need for continuous ART with sacrificing CD4+ cell numbers. We are also actively engaged in the design and implementation of similar exploratory studies of ART-sparing strategies with extramural collaborators to address different facets of this issue. In particular, we are the lead center in a randomized, controlled multi-center international trial recently launched to compare the effects of intermittent scIL-2 therapy with or without the use of peri-cycle antiretroviral treatment. We have also performed phase I II work to determine the safety and preliminary antiviral efficacy of a novel CCR5 inhibitor compound. We have also recently engaged in a series of novel phase I II research efforts to characterize both conventional and investigational antiviral agents of potential utility in the treatment of both seasonal influenza as well as avian (H5N1) influenza. We also continue our efforts to improve access to clinical trials by local minority populations through an outreach that includes a close relationship with local clinics for medically under-served populations. Finally, we continue an active role in helping establish a clinical research infrastructure in the South African National Defense Force military health-care system through our ongoing participation in the HIV research projects organized under Project Phidisa.',\n",
       " 'Previously we discovered that herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) enters laboratory cell lines by endocytosis as well as by nonendocytosis mechanisms. HSV-1 enters monkey kidney (Vero) cells by direct penetration of the plasma membrane, while the virus enters Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that express virus entry receptors by pH-dependent endocytosis. HSV-2 infects persons through mucosal surfaces or through breaks in keratinized squamous epithelial cells and then travels to the nervous system where the virus establishes latency in neurons. We have found that HSV-1 enters primary and transformed epidermal keratinocytes through endocytosis, while the virus enters primary neurons and neuroblastoma cell lines by penetration of the plasma membrane. Entry of the virus in keratinocytes is inhibited by agents that inhibit inhibit endocytosis such as drugs that elevate the pH of endosomes or inhibit cellular tyrosine kinase activity. These same drugs do not inhibit entry of the virus in transformed neuronal cells.',\n",
       " 'IL-27 is a Th1 cytokine that induces IFN-g secretion along with IL-12. However, it differs from IL-12 in that lack of IL-27 signaling has been associated with excessive responses to infectious agents. To explore the mechanism of this phenomenon we determined the effect of IL-27 on T cell apoptosis. We found that stimulation of T cells with a polyclonal activator in the presence of IL-27 and anti-Fas or Fas L led to marked increased apoptosis. This IL-27-enhanced apoptosis was accompanied by increase activation induced cell death and increased apoptosis associated with cytokine withdrawal (IL-2 withdrawal). In contrast, TNF- or Trail-induced apoptosis was not significantly affected. IL-27 is not simply mimicking the effects of either IL-2 or IFN-g since it enhances Fas-mediated apoptosis in the presence of excess amounts of these cytokines. In studies of the mechanism of IL-27-induced apoptosis, we found that IL-27 had no significant effect on FasL expression , and by quantitative rt-PCR it has only minor effects on any of a variety of intracellular factors shown previous to be involved in apoptosis such as Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL, FADD, FLIP and caspase 8. In addition , by rtPCR it had only minor effects on survivin, IAP proteins or GADD45 isoforms. Finally, IL-27 enhanced apoptosis was not significantly affected by the presence of a methyl1-beta-cyclodextrane (MBCD) an agent that interferes with the assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex in cell membrane rafts. While these studies do not identify the mechanism of IL-27 enhancement of apoptosis, they do establish the the reality of this phenomenon and therefore one of the reasons IL-27 deficiency leads to over-exuberant immune reponses. As such, defects in IL-27 secretion could account for some types of autoimmunity.',\n",
       " 'We have previously characterized a model for immune activation of HIV-1 in which viral proteins as well as infectious virus are induced in HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) mice by infection with intracellular protozoan and bacterial pathogens commonly encountered by AIDS patients. Viral expression in this system appears to be restricted in situ and in vitro to antigen presenting cells (APC) with T cells failing to respond even after polyclonal stimulation. As reported last year, we have found that toll like receptors (TLR) play a major role in the triggering of transgenic HIV responses by co-infecting pathogens such as mycobacteria. During the present report period, we examined a strategy for preventing microbial induced immune activation of HIV involving TLR remodelling. This process, which was initially termed \"endotoxin tolerance\", refers to the induction of a hyporesponsive state in macrophages following primary exposure to microbial ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacterial lipoprotein, lipoteichoic acid, and oligo CpGDNA, now known to signal through TLRs. The resulting tolerant state is associated with a marked decrease in proinflammatory cytokine production following secondary challenge with these ligands.Because of the growing evidence that microbial ligand-TLR interactions can play a role in driving HIV-1 expression, it was possible that reprogramming, mediated by TLR, could be used as a means of reducing HIV viral loads in coinfected individuals. Unexpectedly, Tg splenocytes and macrophages, rendered tolerant in vitro to TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 ligands as assessed by proinflammatory cytokine secretion and nuclear factor-B activation, showed enhanced rather than decreased HIV-1 p24 production. A similar enhancement was observed in splenocytes tolerized and then challenged with heterologous TLR ligands. Moreover, TLR2- and TLR4-ligand homotolerized mice demonstrated significantly increased plasma p24 production in vivo despite lower levels of TNF-alpha.Together, these results demonstrate that HIV-1 expression is enhanced in TLR-reprogrammed host cells, arguing against the use of TLR-reprogramming as a strategy for preventing microbial induced viral immune activation. It is possible that the observed enhancement rather than suppression of HIV gene expression may reflect a mechanism used by the virus to escape the effects of microbial-induced tolerance during natural infection in vivo.',\n",
       " 'DC-SIGN, a dendritic cell surface C-type lectin receptor, has been proposed to enhance HIV-1 infection of T cells in trans. The physiological role of DC-SIGN was thought to bind adhesion molecules, ICAM-2 and ICAM-3, to initiate a dendritic cell and T cell contact to facilitate the T cell activation and priming by dendritic cells. We expressed various extracellular truncations of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR as recombinant proteins and showed that 1) DC-SIGN R forms a tetramer through the extracellular repeat region; 2) the receptor-gp120 binding affinity depends on the oligomerization of the receptor; 3) DC-SIGN R recognition of gp120 is pH dependent such that the affinity reduced drastically under the endosomal pH condition; and 4) DC-SIGN recognizes ICAM-3 with much lower affinity than it does gp120. The structural study of DC-SIGN R has resulted in a 1.5 E resolution crystal structure for DC-SIGN R8 and a molecular model for the tetrameric extracellular DC-SIGN R. Based on the model, a prediction scheme was developed to evaluate potential ligands for DC-SIGN. A ligand search among the sequences of the human genome and genomes of human viruses revealed a diverse list of potential host and viral ligands of the receptor. The host ligands include not only adhesion molecules but also a family of mucin-like proteins, the extracellular matrix proteins and some tumor markers. Most of the enveloped RNA viruses appear to have ligands for the receptor. Using a bovine submaxillary mucin as the example, we showed both in solution and on the cell surface that DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR recognize the mucin family of proteins with sub-micromolar affinity. The receptor binding to mucin competes with the receptor binding to HIV-1 gp120. Using FACS analysis and confocal microscopy, we showed that DC-SIGN preferentially recognizes MUC1-transfected cells as well as an MUC1-expressing cancer cell line Colo205. The binding of DC-SIGN R to Colo205 cells can be blocked with mannan in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, we propose that DC-SIGN functions as an antigen- capturing receptor for both viral glycoprotein and cellular tumor and mucin-associated antigens. The receptor internalization would lead to the degradation and antigen presentation. SIGLECs (sialic-acid Ig-like binding lectins) are a family of adhesion and signaling receptors that specifically recognize sialylated carbohydrate moieties. The potential involvement of members of SIGLEC family receptors in HIV pathogenesis remain to be determined. To understand the molecular basis for the sialic acid-dependent adhesion implemented by SIGLECs and to get an insight into receptor specificity, structural studies have been carried out using two Ig-like N-terminal domains of SIGLEC-5. X-ray structure solution using molecular replacement with phased translation function uncovered unparalleled features not seen in other one-domain structures of related SIGLECs, including unusual conformation of variable loop C-C of the ligand-binding domain and a unique interdomain disulfide bond. To get an insight into receptor specificity, we have crystallized several receptor-ligand complexes using sialylated oligosaccharides commonly found at cell surfaces and in the extracellular milieu. In combination with binding assays, these structural studies have given us an insight into what governs ligand recognition and receptor specificity in SIGLEC family of lectins.',\n",
       " 'The parasite that causes malaria invades and prospers in various tissues such as skin, blood, liver, gut, and salivary glands of its human and mosquito hosts. The invasion of many different kinds of cells implies that the parasite makes use of a diverse cell biology of receptor-ligand interactions. By determining the three-dimensional structures of receptor and ligand proteins, we are studying the interactions that allow the parasite to specifically target a particular type of cell to invade. The parasite receptors, being on the cell surface, are also prime candidates for the development of anti-malarial vaccines as immunity to malaria appears to correlate with immune responses to cell surface receptors. We have crystallized three malarial cell surface proteins and are working on several more. With x-ray diffraction data in hand for two receptors, we are proceeding to determine their three-dimensional structures. We have obtained x-ray data and are seeking improved crystals and data for two additional receptors. The receptors we are studying are candidates for inclusion in a vaccine and are expressed in several life stages of the malarial parasite. Through these studies we expect to reveal the overall shapes and the specific interactions of important receptors on the parasite.',\n",
       " \"The Apicomplexan Molecular Physiology Section continued its studies of the plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC) and made two significant contributions. First, we identified and characterized a novel antimalarial drug resistance mechanism based on reduced drug uptake via PSAC (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 52:2346, 2008). This discovery entailed in vitro selection of malaria parasites resistant to leupeptin, a broad specificity cysteine and serine protease inhibitor. Because leupeptin has multiple targets within infected cells, workers assumed that resistance would not be acquired easily. We found that leupeptin resistance was not associated with upregulation of cysteine protease activity, reduced leupeptin sensitivity of this activity, or expression level changes for putative cysteine or serine proteases in the parasite genome. Instead, it was associated with marked changes in PSAC, as measured with patch-clamp and other transport assays. PSAC antagonists were found to antagonize parasite growth inhibition by leupeptin, suggesting that leupeptin can access its intracellular targets only after passive uptake via PSAC. The resistant parasite's channel mediated significantly reduced leupeptin uptake and could fully account for the acquired resistance. Reduced passive uptake of bulky hydrophilic antimalarial agents via selection of mutations in PSAC represents a novel antimalarial drug resistance mechanism that should be considered by drug discovery and development programs. Second, we carried out additional high-throughput screens of small molecule libraries for PSAC antagonists. These screens have successfully identified novel antagonists with unique properties. These include compounds that have the highest known affinity (low nanomolar) and specificity for PSAC inhibition, novel agonists that increase transport via PSAC, compounds that alter solute selectivity, and compounds that provide new insights into the structure and function of PSAC.\",\n",
       " 'The HIV envelope protein, gp120 mediates entry of the virus into CD4+ human cells. gp120 is also the sole viral protein against which neutralizing antibodies are elicited. For these reasons gp120 is an important protein both in the development of therapeutic agents designed to prevent infection of human cells, and as a principal component of an AIDS vaccine. One of the key events in the viral replication cycle is the binding of gp120, expressed on the surface of virions, to CD4 receptors expressed on human T-cells. When gp120 binds to the CD4 receptor its structure (conformation) changes in a dramatic fasion. The principal purpose of this project is to design and characterize a recombinant protein derivative of the CD4 receptor that effectively locks gp120 into the CD4-bound conformation. The development and characterization of such a reagent will provide fundamental information relevant to the design of effective entry inhibitors and vaccines. Monomeric soluble CD4 (sCD4) has been evaluated as a decoy drug to absorb sufficient amounts of HIV in vivo to limit the progression of disease. Unfortunately, sCD4 was ineffective in human trials. We hypothesized that a sCD4-based molecule that was large, that bound multiple gp120s simultaneously, and that was highly avid to gp120 could overcome the defects of monomeric sCD4 and effectively inhibit HIV entry into target cells. Therefore, we constructed a polymeric CD4-IgG1 fusion protein with a very large hydrodynamic radius of 12 nm and the capacity to bind at least 10 gp120 subunits with binding kinetics that suggested a highly avid interaction to virion-associated envelope; the protein was called D1D2-Igatp. Unlike sCD4, this protein did not enhance viral replication at suboptimal concentrations. In viral neutralization assays, D1D2-Igatp inhibited HIV replication at levels comparable to the most potent neutralizing antibodies available. In addition, it has been determined that D1D2-Igatp crosslinks CD16 receptors on NK cells and activates those cells. The dual specificity of this molecule for both HIV envelope and CD16 may promote NK cell-mediated killing of HIV-infected cells. These observations may aid in the design of new therapeutic strategies for HIV infection. With respect to vaccine development, D1D2-Igatp binds to gp120 in a higly avid manner, and in doing so effectively locks gp120 in an alternate confomation. This alternate conformation exposes epitopes on gp120 that may elicit more broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses. We have tested complexes of D1D2-Igatp bound to recombinant gp120, and have shown in animals that the immune response to this complex is considerably more broadly cross-reactive than that to the ualtered gp120.',\n",
       " 'Innate immunity is the first line of defense designed to protect the host from invading pathogens, including HIV. HIV viremia is associated with a wide range of immune dysfunctions that contribute to an immunocompromised state and disease progression. Persistent HIV replication has been shown to have a broad effect on several immune cell types and or their interactions involved in mounting an effective immune response. We have previously described several NK cell abnormalities in HIV-viremic individuals. In the past year, we investigated the integrity of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)-NK cell interactions among HIV viremic, aviremic and seronegative individuals. Our results describe: 1) a critical defect in the ability of pDCs from HIV infected individuals to secrete IFN-&#61537; and TNF and subsequently activate NK cells and: 2) an inherent defect in NK cells from HIV infected individuals to respond to pDC-secreted cytokines. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate a direct effect of HIV trimeric gp120 on NK cells in vitro similar to that described ex vivo. Finally, we were able to establish that HIV gp120-mediated suppressive effect on NK cells resulted from its binding to the integrin alpha4beta7 expressed on NK cells. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which HIV is capable of suppressing innate immune function in infected individuals.',\n",
       " 'The principal goal of this project is to understand the impact of HIV envelope-mediated signaling on viral replication and immune dysfunction. This information may facilitate the discovery of new strategies for the treatment of HIV infection. HIV envelope proteins, which are displayed on the surface of viral particles, bind to two receptors on T-lymphocytes in order to facilitate infection of those cells. Initially envelope proteins on the outer surface of virions dock with the CD4 receptor, and subsequently engage a co-receptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4. Envelope engagement of each of these receptors results in signal transduction; however the consequences of this signaling is only partially understood. In previous studies we demonstrated that HIV envelope-mediated signaling induces several biological responses in primary T-cells and macrophages, including the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and increased rate of apoptosis. More recently it has been shown that envelope also binds to DC-SIGN, a C-type lectin receptor. We have determined that gp120 binding to DC-SIGN on dendritic cells also mediates biological responses. We evaluated the response of monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) to a panel of recombinant oligomeric envelope proteins with different glycosylation content. Modulation of gene expression was evaluated using oligonucleotide microarrays, and protein phosphorylation events were evaluated with high throughput proteomic analysis. MDDC responses were strongly influenced by the carbohydrate content of gp120. We identified genes upregulated only by a hyperglycosylated gp120 and genes upregulated only by a hypoglycosylated gp120. We are also evaluating gp120 interactions with other C-type lectin receptors that are expressed on other cell types. Understanding how various cell types respond to gp120 may provide further insight into the basis of HIV induced immune dysfunction and pathogenesis. Of particular interest is the interaction of gp120 with plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). pDCs, which play a central role in innate and adaptive immune responses against viral infections, secrete type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines upon stimulation via either TLR7 or TLR9. Throughout the course of HIV infection, the production of type-I IFNs is profoundly impaired, and total pDC cell counts in peripheral blood correlates inversely with viral load and positively with CD4+ T-cell count. The origin of these defects is unclear. pDCs express CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4, the primary receptor and co-receptors, respectively, for the HIV envelope, yet little is known about the effects of the viral envelope on these cells. We determined that exposure of pDCs to gp120 results in the suppression of activation of these cells. This suppression was specific for TLR9-mediated responses, since TLR7-mediated responses were unaffected by gp120. gp120 also suppressed TLR9-mediated induction of proinflammatory cytokines and the expression of CD83, a marker of DC activation. Finally, gp120 suppressed pDC-induced cytolytic activity of NK cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the direct interaction of HIV-1 gp120 with pDCs interferes with TLR9 activation resulting in a decreased ability of pDCs to secrete antiviral and inflammatory factors that typically play a central role in initiating host immune responses against invading pathogens.',\n",
       " 'Our laboratory has developed mouse models of allergic eye disease and asthma to enable us to study the pathogenesis of allergic disease in vivo. Our model of allergic conjunctivitis allows us to use topical application of allergens to assess a localized allergic response, and is particularly useful for examining goblet cell hyperproliferation and mast cell degranulation. A number of studies have suggested that allergen exposure in previously sensitized animals causes IgE bearing cells, such as mast cells and basophils, are first activated and work to recruit and activate a number of other effector cells such as T cells and eosinophils. We are particularly interested in characterizing cytokines that may act to downmodulate the earliest phases of the allergic response including IL-10. This project seeks to use a number of different gene disrupted or \"knockout\" and transgenic cytokine mice (e.g. IL-10ko, IL-10TG, IL-5ko, IL-5 TG etc.) to examine the events responsible for immediate cytokine production in the mucosal environment upon allergen challenge, including possible production by mast cells, and how cytokines such as IL-10 can help modulate this early response. In particular, we have seen an important role for IL-10 in influencing mast cell stability, something that may prove essential to the prevention both the early stages of allergic responses, including histamine release, and the later phases of allergic disease involving allergic inflammation and influx of eosinophils and other mediators of the allergic phenomenon. We are in the process of defining alterations in the degranulation response in IL-10KO, IL-10 transgenics, and WT control animals to better understand how IL-10 affects the degranulation process at a cellular and molecular level. A secondary factor that we have found to be essential in preventing mast cell activation in our mast cells is GP49 since mice that are genetically deficient in this inhibitory receptor have increased mast cell degranulation after allergen challenge compared with control animals. We are currently examining gp49B KO as well as control gp49A KO animals in order to more fully characterize the role of this inhibitory receptor on mast cells as well as other inflammatory cells involved in the allergic process.',\n",
       " 'The immune system reacts to the allergens that cause asthma, such as ragweed pollen, by producing antibodies against them. However, only about 25 percent of people produce the IgE that can lead to asthma, with the rest managing to suppress or avoid this allergic response through a process known as tolerance. Tolerance is based upon the fact that the immune system has evolved several mechanisms to maintain a state of non-responsiveness to innocuous antigens. In particular, clonal deletion, anergy, and active suppression, mediated by regulatory cells secreting transforming growth factor B and Interleukin 10 have been implicated in the down-regulation of immune responses. However, the immunological events and cellular mechanisms involved in inducing the T cell hyporesponsiveness to allergens in local and systemic allergic diseases are poorly defined. We have recently begun using a panel of double-cytokine knockout mice to help delineate the role of IL-10 in allergic diseases. This panel includes mice deficient in both IL-10 and IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-gamma, and IL-10 and IL-12 as well as their single cytokine knockout controls. We have used these animals in our models of allergic eye disease and allergic asthma, and have found a role for IL-10 in the suppression of both Th1 and Th2 responses. In particular, Il-10 appears to be essential for the regulation of eosinophils in the allergic response. We have also found a dichotomy between the role of IL-10 in controlling inflammation and increasing airway hyperresponsiveness to allergen challenge. We have also developed a mouse model that uses Ascaris suum infection to amplify allergic responses and the eventual induction of tolerance through the development of both Ascaris-specific and allergen-specific T regulatory cells. Finally, we have begun studies using Ascaris antigen alone instead of Ascaris infection to determine if the same T regulatory cells can be developed without infection',\n",
       " 'Chronic inflammation mediated by Th2-type cytokines can lead to morbidity and mortality in allergy asthma. Therefore, one of our major research goals has been to understand the immunological mechanisms controlling Th2 response development, and to design effective immunotherapies to treat or prevent such reactions by targeting the endogenous regulatory mechanisms that prevent the development of allergic disease in the majority of individuals. In particular, we are interested in understanding how chronic allergic disease leads to tissue remodeling and fibrosis. The development of fibrous tissue is part of the normal process of healing after injury. Nevertheless, in some circumstances, there is a destructive accumulation of excess collagen that interferes with the normal function of the affected tissue. Although there is a great deal of mechanistic information regarding the process of scar tissue formation, there are still large gaps in our understanding of the role of inflammatory cells and cytokines in initiating the fibrotic process. We have been using a mouse model of chronic Ascaris infection to mimic the tissue remodeling seen in models of chronic asthma infection. We are hoping that elucidating the mechanisms leading to tissue pathology and fibrosis may lead to more effective strategies for immunological intervention in this and a variety of other chronic diseases. We are also hoping to use some of the new imaging technology including MRI and CT to visualize changes in mouse lungs over time in our fibrosis studies. If we are able to assess gradual changes in fibrosis and lung structure, we will use such techniques with some of our knockout and transgenic mice to see how different genes effect tissue remodeling. In addition, we have examined the role of other cytokines such as IL-21 and TSLP in the development of tissue remodeling and resultant asthmatic response.',\n",
       " 'The D30 deletion mutation, originally created in dengue virus type 4 (DEN4) by the removal of nucleotides 172-143 from the 3-UTR, was introduced into a homologous region of wild type dengue virus type 1 (DEN1). The resulting virus, rDEN1del30, was attenuated in rhesus monkeys to a level similar to that of the rDEN4del30 vaccine candidate. rDEN1del30 was more attenuated in rhesus monkeys than the previously described vaccine candidate, rDEN1mutF, which also contains mutations in the 3-UTR, and both vaccines were highly protective against challenge with wild type DEN1. Both rDEN1del30 and rDEN1mutF were also attenuated in HuH-7-SCID mice. However, neither rDEN1del30 nor rDEN1mutF showed restricted replication following intrathoracic administration in the mosquito Toxorhynchites splendens. The ability of the D30 mutation to attenuate both DEN1 and DEN4 viruses suggests that a tetravalent DEN vaccine could be generated by introduction of the del30 mutation into wild type DEN viruses belonging to each of the four serotypes. DEN2 Antigenic chimeric viruses in which the structural genes of dengue virus type 4 (DEN4) have been replaced with those derived from dengue virus type 2 (DEN2) have been created and evaluated as a first step in generating a live attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccine. Specifically, the capsid, membrane precursor, and envelope (CME) or the membrane precursor and envelope (ME) gene regions of DEN2 were substituted for the corresponding genes of wild-type rDEN4 or vaccine candidate rDEN4del30 which contains a 30 nucleotide deletion (del30) in the 3 untranslated region. The two DEN2 4 chimeric viruses lacking the del30 mutation were highly attenuated in tumor-bearing SCID-HuH-7 mice, mosquitoes, and rhesus monkeys, indicating chimerization with either the CME or ME regions lead to attenuation. In mosquitoes and SCID-HuH-7 mice, addition of the del30 mutation to the chimeric viruses resulted in comparable or only slightly increased levels of attenuation. In rhesus monkeys, addition of the D30 mutation rendered the CME chimeric virus non-infectious, indicating that the attenuation resulting from chimerization and the D30 mutation were additive for these animals. In contrast, the attenuation in rhesus monkeys of ME chimeric virus was not significantly modified by the addition of the D30 mutation. The satisfactory level of attenuation and immunogenicity achieved by the ME containing DEN2 4D30 chimeric virus, as well as its very low infectivity for mosquitoes, make it a vaccine candidate suitable for evaluation in phase I clinical trials. DEN3 Three novel recombinant DEN virus type 3 (DEN3) vaccine candidates have been generated from a DEN3 virus isolated from a mild outbreak of dengue fever in Sleman, Central Java, Indonesia in 1978. Antigenic chimeric viruses were prepared by replacing the membrane precursor and envelope proteins (ME) of recombinant DEN4 (rDEN4) virus with those from DEN3 Sleman 78 in the presence (rDEN3 4del30(ME)) and absence (rDEN3 4(ME)) of the del30 mutation, a previously described 30 nucleotide deletion in the 3 untranslated region. In addition, a full-length infectious cDNA clone was generated from the DEN3 isolate and used to produce rDEN3 virus and the vaccine candidate, rDEN3del30. rDEN3 4(ME) and rDEN3 4del30(ME) appear to be acceptable vaccine candidates since they were restricted in replication in SCID mice transplanted with human hepatoma cells, in rhesus monkeys, and in Aedes and Toxorynchites mosquitoes, and each was protective in rhesus monkeys against DEN3 virus challenge. The rDEN3 4(ME) and rDEN3 4del30(ME) viruses were comparable in all parameters evaluated, indicating that antigenic chimerization resulted in the observed high level of attenuation. Surprisingly, rDEN3del30 was not attenuated in any model tested when compared to wild type rDEN3 and therefore, is not a vaccine candidate at present. Thus, the rDEN3 4(ME) and rDEN3 4del30(ME) antigenic chimeric viruses can be considered for evaluation in humans and for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine. DEN4 A dengue virus vaccine candidate, rDEN4del30, has been previously reported to be safe and immunogenic in humans, but a subset of vaccinees developed asymptomatic rash, elevation of liver enzymes and or mild neutropenia. In the current study, mutations that had previously been shown to reduce replication of DEN4 virus in suckling mice and or in SCID mice engrafted with human liver cells (SCID-HuH-7 mice) were introduced into rDEN4del30 in an attempt to further attenuate this virus. Three of the five resulting modified rDEN4del30 viruses showed decreased replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice relative to rDEN4del30. Moreover, in rhesus monkeys, two of the modified rDEN4del30 viruses showed a decrease in replication relative to rDEN4del30 while generating levels of neutralizing antibody similar to rDEN4del30 virus. All of the modified rDEN430 viruses completely protected immunized rhesus monkeys from challenge with wild-type DEN4 virus. Based on their attenuation for both human liver cells and rhesus monkeys, two of the modified rDEN4del30 vaccine candidates are currently being prepared for use in clinical trials. The application of these attenuating mutations to flavivirus vaccine development is discussed. Mutations which increase the replication of dengue viruses in cell culture would greatly facilitate the manufacture of both a live attenuated or inactivated dengue virus vaccine. We have identified eight missense mutations in dengue virus type 4 (DEN4) that increase the plaque size and kinetics of replication of recombinant DEN4 (rDEN4) virus in Vero cells. rDEN4 viruses bearing these Vero cell adaptation mutations were also evaluated for the level of replication in the brains of mice. Two recombinant viruses expressing distinct mutations in NS3 were both restricted in replication in the brains of suckling mouse. In contrast, six recombinant viruses, each encoding individual mutations in NS4B (five) or in NS5 (one), were not attenuated in mouse brain. Recombinant viruses encoding various combinations of these Vero cell adaptation mutations did not demonstrate enhanced replication in Vero cells over that exhibited by the single mutations. Finally, addition of a subset of the above non-attenuating, adaptation mutations to a DEN2 4 chimeric vaccine candidate was found to increase the virus yield in Vero cells by up to 500-fold. The importance of these Vero cell adaptation mutations in flavivirus vaccine design and development is discussed.',\n",
       " 'In the past year, we have finished developing and evaluating two microarray platforms for large-scale genotyping of P. falciparum parasite. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) we collected in previous year, we have developed an array using Molecular Inversion Probe (MIP) technology and used the array to type more than 100 parasites. We also evaluated a tiling array for SNP detection and gene copy number variation. We showed that the tiling array was an excellent tool for genotyping too. Both arrays have been used to type parasite genomes. We are testing parasite responses to different antimalrial drugs to identify genes that may contribute to drug resistance. This study is expected to identify some candidate genes that can be further tested using other methods such as genetic modification of the genes. For example, we showed that several transporters were associated with higher levels of resistance to CQ and QN in one of our previous studies. Now we have disrupted one of the candidate genes and showed that it indeed could affect parasite response to both CQ and QN. We have finished testing the knockout parasites for their responses to drugs and other chemicals. The resources developed from this study will be useful for studying other parasite phenotypes. Mutations in drug resistance gene are often deleterious; and parasite can respond to the mutations with compensatory changes in their genome in order to survive. We used mcicroarray to search for genes that changed in expression after mutations in the key CQ resistant gene (pfcrt). A list of genes that changed in expression levels and in copy number were identified in parasite that had mutations in pfcrt. Another important issue associated with association mapping is accurate phenotyping. We investigated how mixed infections (often seen in field samples) of drug resistant and sensitive parasites affect drug test results. We found that a mixture of 10% (or more) resistant parasite in a sensitive population could greatly affect drug test results, providing important information for drug tests in the field. Last year, we found that P. vivax parasites in Southern Mexico consist of three subpopulations that had strong mosquito vector preferences. Identification of molecules that mediate mosquito specificity may provide critical information for transmission control. We have genotyped hundreds of more parasite samples and are investigating the relationship of genotypes and relapse re-infections to better understand parasite transmission dynamics. We are also interested in gene regulation mechanisms such as chromatin modification or microRNA mediated mechanisms.',\n",
       " 'Previously, a total of 18 adult volunteers was given orally 1 ml of a 0.2% stool filtrate containing the virulent human rotavirus strain D (G1, P1A8, NSP4B) (Kapikian, et al., 1983. J. Infec. Dis. 147:95). Four of 5 who shed rotavirus after challenge developed diarrhea. In an attempt to identify correlates of resistance to rotaviral diarrheal disease and or infection, we analyzed serum IgA and IgG antibody titers in 16 of the 18 volunteers. We used an immunocytochemistry assay involving a total of 18 different recombinant baculoviruses expressing each of the following major serotype genotype sepcificities of rotavirus proteins for the serologic assays: VP4 (P8; P4; P6; P9; P10); VP7 (G1-4, G9); NSP4 (A-D); as well as VP6 and NSP2. The prechallenge IgG antibody titers to types G1 and G3 VP7, types P8 and P6 VP4 and type A NSP4 in the non-infected group were significantly higher than those in the asymptomatically infected and symptomatically infected groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that the higher probability of resistance to asymptomatic and symptomatic rotavirus infection correlated with higher prechallenge IgG antibody titers to the homotypic VP7 (G1) (p is equal to 0.0077 for asymptomatic infection; p is equal to 0.0004 for symptomatic infection) and the homotypic VP4 (P8) (p is equal to 0.0091 for asymptomatic infection; p is equal to 0.0011 for symptomatic infection), suggesting that protection against rotavirus infection and disease may be VP7- and or VP4-homotypic although they may not be the sole determinants of protective immunity. Using an immunocytochemical staining assay involving six different recombinant baculoviruses with each expressing one of the major bovine rotavirus VP7 (G6, G8 or G10) and VP4 (P1, P5 or P11) serotypes, we analyzed IgG antibody responses to individual proteins in archival serum samples collected from 31 Holstein calves approximately monthly from 1 month to 12 months of age during 1974-1975 at the Arizona Dairy Company located in Higley, Arizona. The calves were given colostrum immediately after birth and raised separately from their mothers. The serum samples sent to NIH were stored in a -20 degree Celsius freezer until testing. A total of 309 serum samples were analyzed in this study. Each of 31 calves experienced at least one rotavirus infection as determined by a 4-fold or greater G- and or P-serotype-specific antibody response during the period of 12 months. Of note was the finding that calves that experienced their first seroresponse between 2 and <4 months of age had a significantly lower antibody titer to certain serotypes at 1 month of age than those that developed a seroresponse later, suggesting that maternal antibody might play a role in delaying primary infections and or the development of antibody responses. Seroresponses to VP7 and VP4, as determined by a 4-fold or greater antibody response, were not always elicited concurrently following infection: in some calves seroresponses to VP7 were detected earlier than to VP4 or vice versa. In addition, in some calves, a subsequent 2nd seroresponse was detected for VP7 or VP4 only. This temporal dissociation of VP7-VP4 responses may be a function of preexisting maternally-derived or primary infection-induced G and or P type-specific antibodies in calves present at the time of the 2nd rotavirus infection. Analyses of serum samples showed that the G8 serotype infected calves most frequently (35.5%) followed by G6 (19.4%), G10 (12.9%), and mixed G type infections (32.3%). With regard to VP4, an IgG response to P1 was detected in 25.8% of samples followed by P5 (12.9%), P11 (6.5%), and mixed P type infections (54.8%). The most frequent G-P combination was G8:P1 followed by G8:P5, G8:P11 and G6:P1. Our analyses of VP7- and VP4-specific antibody responses in calves indicated that (i) repeated infections were less likely to be caused by the G and or P types than those caused by primary infections (Chi square is equal to 3.96, p is equal to 0.047); and (ii) protection against rotavirus reinfection tended to be serotype specific. Although there is still considerable disagreement on the role and importance of serotype-specific immunity in protection against rotavirus-caused illness, our data support the strategy of the administration of a multivalent vaccine and multiple vaccinations in order to elicit broader protection against prevailing serotypes in humans.',\n",
       " \"The Caliciviridae are a family of positive-strand RNA viruses and consist of four genera designated: (1) Norovirus (with species Norwalk virus) (2) Sapovirus (with species Sapporo virus); (3) Vesivirus (with species, feline calicivirus and vesicular exanthema of swine virus); and (4) Lagovirus (with species rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and European brown hare syndrome virus). Norwalk virus (NV) is the prototype strain for the genus Norovirus and was discovered by LID researchers in 1972. The Noroviruses are the major cause of nonbacterial epidemic gastroenteritis that occurs in family, school, institutional, or community-wide outbreaks, affecting all age groups. The human Noroviruses are genetically diverse and cannot be grown in cell culture, which has been a continuing research obstacle. A major goal of this laboratory is the development of control strategies for the caliciviruses (predominantly the noroviruses) associated with gastroenteritis. In order to accomplish this goal, basic knowledge of the epidemiology, immunology, and replication strategies of these viruses is needed. This year, we continued our comparative studies of representative viruses from three distinct Caliciviridae genera- Norovirus, Sapovirus, and Vesivirus. Two viruses, feline calicivirus (Vesivirus) and porcine enteric calicivirus (Sapovirus) grow in cell culture, and we have developed both systems further to study replication in cells. Feline calicivirus grows efficiently without the addition of exogenous factors, but porcine enteric calicivirus requires the presence of intestinal content (IC) fluid from an uninfected pig in the cell culture medium. After several years of searching for the active factor in IC with our collaborator, Dr. Linda Saif, we have now identified the active factors in IC to be bile acids. Although the precise mechanism by which the bile acids allow the growth of porcine enteric calicivirus in cell culture is yet to be determined, we observed an association between the down-regulation of STAT-1 activation and growth of the virus in cells. It is possible that the suppression of the cell's innate immunity might help us to identify a permissive cell culture system for the human noroviruses, and such efforts are in progress. Since human norovirus strains such as Norwalk virus and MD145-12, cannot yet be grown in cell culture, we have focused on study of their nonstructural proteins in in vitro systems. This year, we discovered that the norovirus polymerase is enzymatically active when expressed in bacteria, and that it is active in two forms- the ProPol precursor and mature Pol. We also found that the FCV recombinant polymerase, ProPol, along with its cell culture system, has potential for use as a drug-screening platform for anti-calicivirus drugs. We also characterized the complete genome of a GII 4 norovirus that caused an outbreak in a Maryland hospital in February, 2004 in order to compare its relatedness to the predominant GII 4 norovirus strain that caused outbreaks of gastroenteritis in Maryland nursing homes in the late 1980's. We have identified differences in the genomes of these two viruses that could give insight into how the noroviruses change over time. Our collaborative efforts with Dr. Richard Lloyd at Baylor University resulted in a co-publication this year in which we show for the first time that caliciviruses are associated with a shut-off host cell translation and that the virus-encoded proteinase cleaves poly A binding protein, a critical component of the eukaryotic translation machinery. Our collaboration with Dr. Herbert (Skip) Virgin at Washington University in the characterization of a new murine norovirus has also proceeded well, and we have completed the proteolytic cleavage map of the virus-encoded nonstructural polyprotein.\",\n",
       " 'B cell antibody responses are triggered by the binding of antigen to the clonally distributed B cell antigen receptors (BCRs). Over the last several years a great deal has been learned about the biochemistry of the complex signal cascades triggered by BCR antigen engagement. However, what remains relatively poorly understood are the molecular events that trigger the initiation of signaling. We understand that the BCR, like other members of the multichain immune recognition receptor family, is composed of a ligand binding chain, for the BCR a membrane form of Ig, mIg, that has a short cytoplasmic domain with no capacity to interact directly with the components of the signaling cascades. To do so the mIg associates with two additional chains, Ig alpha and Ig beta, that contain within their cytoplasmic domains immunoregulatory tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs). The BCR has no inherent kinase activity but following antigen binding one of the first events observed is the phosphorylation of the BCR ITAMs by the Src-family kinase, Lyn. This project represents an approach to understanding the changes that occur in the BCR following antigen binding that allow Lyn to discriminate the antigen-bound BCR from the unbound BCR. Based on the crystal structure of antigens bound to antibodies there is at present no evidence for an antigen-induced structural change in the BCR that could propagate the information that the BCR has bound antigen from the BCR ectodomains, across the membrane, to the cytoplasmic domains. In the absence of such an allosteric effect of antigen binding one is left with antigen-induced clustering of the BCR as the trigger for the initiation of signaling. Thus, the goal of this project is to gain an understanding of how antigen induces BCRs to cluster and how BCR clustering leads to the initiation of signaling. The critical events that trigger signaling are likely to occur within seconds of antigen binding to the BCR and to be highly dynamic, involving many weak protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. In general, the biochemical approaches that have been used so effectively to describe the BCR signaling pathways are inadequate to capture events that occur as rapidly and as transiently as those predicted to initiate BCR signaling. In addition, antigen binding to the B cell involves a dramatic spatial change in the BCRs resulting in their patching and capping and the formation of an immune synapse. All this potentially important spatial information is lost with the addition of detergents to cells for biochemical analyses. The use of detergents is particularly problematic in the study of the early membrane changes that accompany antigen binding by BCRs. Consequently we have taken advantage of live cell imaging technologies that allow analyses of the BCR and components of the BCR signaling pathway with the temporal and spatial resolution necessary to view the earliest events in B cell activation without the complications that the addition of detergents introduce. Over the last year we have applied the new technology of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging that allows us to view the interactions of proteins and lipids in living cells, to better characterize the earliest events in antigen-driven BCR signaling, namely, the oligomerization of the receptor and its association with sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains termed lipid rafts. Using quantitative FRET imaging we showed that the BCR is a monomer of the surface of resting cells and that multivalent antigen binding results in the simultaneous phosphorylation of the receptors cytoplasmic domains of the BCR, a change in the conformation of the cytoplasmic domains of the BCR from a clustered to an open form and the rapid yet transient association with lipids that compose lipid rafts. These events precede the activation of downstream signaling events and require the continuous activity of Src-family kinases but not the binding of Syk. Thus, the initiation of BCR signaling is a remarkably dynamic process accompanied by reversible conformation changes and raft lipid associations induced by Src-family kinase activity. Efforts are under way to introduce appropriate FRET donor and acceptor pairs into transgenic mice to allow us to image signaling events in normal B cell subsets. To better resolve the spatial and temporal order of the early events in B cell activation we used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) in conjunction with FRET. We showed that in B cells responding to antigen presented on a planar lipid bilayer, simulating an antigen presenting cell, BCRs form signaling active microclusters by a mechanism that does not require physical crosslinking of BCRs by multivalent antigens. We observed that in response to either monovalent or multivalent antigens the BCRs accumulate and form microclusters at the initial points of contact of the B cell membrane with the bilayer. Clustering did not depend on a signaling active BCR revealing an intrinsic tendency of the BCR to cluster. The microclusters grow by trapping mobile BCR and the larger clusters are actively organized into an immune synapse. The kinetics of these events and signaling are identical for monovalent and multivalent antigens. Our findings that monovalent interactions between the BCR and antigen lead to B cell activation provides a mechanism by which B cells are able to respond to the topologically diverse, unpredictable world of pathogen antigens. These results may also be highly relevant to the mechanism by which T cell receptors cluster in response to monovalent peptide-MHC complexes on antigen presenting cell surfaces. We also use FRET in conjunction with TIRFM to describe the interaction of the BCR with a membrane raft lipid probe and the membrane raft lipid-tethered Src-family kinases, Lyn. We provide evidence for an ordered process in which the antigen-induced BCR microclusters form and then transiently associate with the raft lipid probe in a signaling- and cytoskeleton-independent fashion. Association with raft lipids leads to a more stable interaction of the clustered BCR with Lyn that persists as the BCR microclusters move to form a central synapse. Taken together these results provide a new view of the earliest events in BCR signaling, underscoring a role of BCR-lipid interactions in the formation of signaling active BCR complexes.',\n",
       " 'The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) serves dual, interrelated functions in B cell activation. The first is to initiate signal cascades that result in the transcription of a variety of genes associated with B cell activation. The second is to traffic bound antigen into the cell to deliver the antigen into intracellular compartments where the antigen is proteolytically cleaved and the resulting peptides are assembled into MHC class II-peptide complexes. The MHC class II-peptide complexes are expressed on the B cell surface for recognition by helper T cells that will as a consequence be activated to provide essential growth and differentiation factors to the B cell. The signaling and antigen transport functions of the BCR are interdependent in that the BCR signaling is necessary for the correct and rapid intracellular targeting of the antigen. Our current evidence indicates that the BCR enters the class II-containing compartment as an intact, signaling competent, receptor. However, at present it is an open question as to whether the BCR signals intracellularly and if so what role intracellular signaling might play in B cell activation. The long term goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the correct targeting of the BCR to the class II-containing compartments including determining where in the pathway discrete signaling events occur and to further define the role of intracellular signaling on B cell activation with particular focus on the synergistic interaction of the BCR with the intracellular Toll like receptors (TLRs). Studies to delineate the components of the BCR signaling cascade necessary for correct targeting of the BCR provided evidence that the BCR-induced activation of phospholipase D (PLD) is necessary for the correct targeting of the BCR into MHC class II-containing intracellular compartments. PLD is a signal-transduction-activated enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to generate the second messenger phosphatic acid and choline. PLD has been implicated in controlling a wide variety of cellular processes including the endocytosis and vesicular trafficking of cellular receptors. We showed that the activity of PLD was not required for endocytosis of the BCR from the plasma membrane but was required for subsequent steps in the BCRs trafficking pathway. We have mapped the cellular location where components of the BCR signaling pathway are activated by confocal microscopy using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated forms of signaling components including Syk, p38, ERK and JNK. Our results indicated that components of the BCR signaling pathway are activated sequentially and in defined subcellular locations. We observed that pSyk appeared on the plasma membrane immediately following BCR crosslinking, whereas the phosphorylated forms of p38, ERK and JNK were not detected until the BCR had internalized from the plasma membrane and trafficked to the class II-containing compartments. We showed that blocking BCR internalization by dansylcadaverine blocked the phosphorylation of both ERK and JNK. The internalized BCR colocalized in LAMP-positive compartments with pERK and pJNK. We also investigated the function and regulation of the intracellular signaling of the BCR. BCR signaling is regulated and fine tuned by an array of B cell coreceptors many of which are present on the cell surface where they presumably interact with the BCR. However, members of one family of receptors, the TLRs, that have been shown to influence BCR signaling are located in intracellular endosomes and not on the plasma membrane. One endosomal TLR, TLR9, that recognizes unmethylated CpG-DNA motifs has been shown to enhance BCR signaling resulting in hyperactivation of B cells to proliferate and differentiate into antibody secreting plasma cells. Recent evidence indicates that synergistic signaling between the BCR and TLR9 underlies the production of self-reactive antibodies in systemic autoimmune diseases and partly explains the preponderance of auto-antibodies that react with DNA-containing antigens. Both the TLR9- and BCR-signaling pathways ultimately result in activation of the p38, JNK and NFKB. Although the BCR and TLR9 initiate signaling from two spatially distinct sites, the BCR from the plasma membrane, and TLR9 from endosomes, our observation that the BCR-induced activation of p38 and JNK occurs inside the cell in large intracellular compartments suggested that such compartments may be sites of synergistic signaling between the BCR and TLR9 in response to DNA-containing antigens. Using confocal microscopy and antibodies specific for the BCR, TLR9, p38 and pJNK we showed that following the binding and internalization of DNA-containing antigens, the BCR signals for the recruitment of TLR9 from multiple small endosomes to a large LAMP1-positive compartments into which the BCR trafficks antigen and where synergistic signaling through to p38 and JNK occurs. The recruitment of TLR9 to the BCR was by a dynein-mediated, microtubule-network dependent process and was necessary for B cell hyper-responses to DNA-containing antigens. Of considerable interest was the observation that recruitment of TLR9 was dependent on the BCRs activation of PLD. Thus, PLD plays a role in both the correct targeting of the BCR to intracellular compartments and the recruitment of TLR9 to the same compartments. The BCRs PLD-activation dependent recruitment of the TLR9 to the MVB represents a novel mechanism underlying the hyper-response of B cells to DNA-containing antigens. Recent results indicate that two additional intracellular TLRs, TLR3 and TLR7 are similarly recruited by the BCR from endosomes to the large, signaling active compartment. Thus, this recruitment mechanism appears to have been conserved to allow the synergistic interaction of the intracellular TLRs with the internalized BCR. We have used a combination of electron and confocal microscopy to better characterize the compartment into which the BCR trafficks and to which the BCR recruits TLRs. By electron microscopy the compartment has the double membranes and multiple vesicular bodies and characteristics of autophagosomes. By confocal microscopy the compartment expressed the autophagosome marker LC3 and in B cells from LC3-difficient mice the BCR failed to recruit TLRs. Collectively these results indicate that the autophagosome is the site of BCR-TLR synergistic signaling. The autophagosomes are of interest as they have been recently shown to play a role in MHC-class II antigen processing by facilitating the transport of antigens in the cytoplasm to the MHC class II molecules.',\n",
       " 'Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs or neutrophils) are essential to the innate immune response against invading microorganisms. In contrast to the acquired immune response, which is dependent on previous interaction with specific bacteria, the ability of PMNs to kill microorganisms is immediate and non-specific. Inasmuch as PMNs produce highly toxic microbicidal components, moderation of infection-induced inflammation is critical for limiting host tissue destruction. This moderation is especially important given that PMNs are the predominant immune cell in most bacterial infections. A key aspect of our research investigates how PMNs ingest and kill bacteria, and elucidates post-phagocytosis sequelae such as apoptosis, processes crucial for the resolution phase of inflammation. Thus, one of our research objectives is to elucidate molecular processes in human PMNs that facilitate resolution of infection. To that end, we used genomics methodologies to establish a global model of host cell-pathogen interaction that provides fundamental insight into the resolution of infection in humans. A second focus of research in my laboratory investigates how bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus or GAS) evade human innate host defense to cause disease. Although most bacteria are killed readily by PMNs, some human pathogens have evolved mechanisms to inhibit phagocytosis and death resulting from exposure to ROS and microbicidal products. For example, strains of S. aureus which produce Panton-Valentine leukocidin cause lethal necrotizing pneumonia in non-immunocomprimised individuals, the molecular basis for which is unknown. We hypothesize staphylococcal pathogenesis includes evasion of PMN killing and undetermined host-susceptibility factors. GAS successfully evades PMN phagocytosis and killing to cause human infections such as pharyngitis and necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating syndrome). To date, our studies include identification of genes and proteins used by GAS to evade destruction by human neutrophils, hence contributing to GAS virulence, survival and pathogenesis. These studies identified new potential vaccine antigens and targets for therapeutic interventions designed to control GAS infections.',\n",
       " 'The degradation of cellular molecules is a normal process that can go awry. Defects in the degradation of various cell macromolecules cause disease and are usually the result of mutations in specific enzymes. Two key enzymes in the degradation of cellular carbohydrates are alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and alpha-galactosidase. Mutations in these enzymes cause Shindler and Fabry diseases, respectively. We have determined the structure of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and alpha-galactosidase by x-ray diffraction techniques. We have mapped the locations of mutations that give rise to Shindler and Fabry diseases and have begun to describe the catalytic mechanisms by which the enzymes perform their normal function of carbohydrate degradation.',\n",
       " 'This Laboratory seeks to elucidate the mechanisms that govern the assembly of supramolecular complexes and the folding of macromolecules, as well as those that underlie the synthesis of viruses, organelles, and other high order structures. In the past year, we have discovered a radical departure from equivalence in the packing of protein molecules in the capsid of bacteriophage HK97. The same protein forms both the hexons and pentons, but whereas the pentons are cyclically symmetric pentamers, the hexons are not cyclically symmetric, but consist of two apposed trimers with a mutual lateral displacement of at least 20 Angstroms. In herpes simplex virus, we have localized the small abundant capsid protein, VP26 (12 Kda) to the outer tips of hexons by quantitative difference imaging. Its exposed location suggests that its role may lie in coupling the capsid to the surrounding tegument. We have also studied several of the major molecules displayed at the outer surface of the pathogenic bacterium, Bordetella pertussis. One of these, filamentous hemagglutinin, is a high immunogenic adhesion. FHA was found to assume a novel 50nm-long monomeric hairpin structure. Its sequence contains two protracted runs of 19-residue repeats which strongly resemble the leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that are present in a set of eukaryotic proteins, many of which have been implicated in intercellular adhesion phenomena. This observation suggests that FHA repeats may be involved in the adhesion of B. pertussis cells to the respiratory tract. ',\n",

       " ' To understand muscle contraction at molecular level, we (i) identify in vivo structural changes that are associated with reaction steps within the actomyosin (cross-bridges) ATPase cycle; (ii) characterize the nature of these structural differences; and (iii) characterize mechanical properties of different actomyosin complexes in muscle. Under a wide range of conditions, response of the contractile system to osmotic compression can be used to screen for structural and mechanical differences of attached cross-bridges. In FY 92-93 we found that both the structure and elastic properties of the weakly attached cross-bridges are distinct from active crossbridges or cross-bridges in rigor. This is significant since the weakly attached cross-bridges represent the pre-force generating states. Our findings further strengthened the hypothesis that force generation results from a structural transformation from a weakly attached to a strongly attached configuration -- a hypothesis supported by the recently published crystal structures of actin, the myosin head and decorated actin filaments. Molecular structure of demembranated relaxed psoas muscle fibers at low temperature is being studied by two dimensional X-ray diffraction. Under these conditions, large fraction of cross-bridge are attached in the pre-force generating states. The diffraction patterns were found to consist of myosin layer lines without rigor features. The meridional intensities at 4400 nm and 2150 nm are approximately 5 times stronger that the 1430 nm reflection, a feature not observed previously in any other preparations. The present results suggest that attachment of pre- force generating cross-bridges shares few if any features with that of the cross-bridges in rigor and distribution of cross-bridges is repeatedly perturbed from the regularly spaced 143 nm levels along the thick filament. The significance of the finding is that even with the atomic structures of actin and myosin fragments becoming known, for any modelling of force generation in muscle, it will be necessary to have information of mass distribution along the filament axis such as those derived from in vivo two dimensional X-ray diffraction studies. Saturation of cross-bridges with nucleotide analogs ATP gamma S and GTP were found to vary over a wide range of concentrations. With modelling, these data should yield information on the elastic properties of a single attached myosin head, a central yet so far unknown quantity. ',\n",
       " 'As a first step to studying the function of extremely large myofibrillar proteins using molecular genetic approaches, genes encoding these proteins must be isolated and cloned. In an attempt to isolate a clone carrying large portions of the coding sequence for mouse nebulin, a CDNA library was constructed using conditions designed to optimize the chances of cloning very large CDNAS. A putative nebulin CDNA clone has been isolated from this library. The clone carries an insert approximately 18 kilobases in length. Control experiments indicate that the entire insert in uncontaminated by the vector sequence, and hence must be genuine CDNA. We are currently mapping the insert for restriction endonuclease sites, and subcloning and sequencing selected segments. Several distinct mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene have been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a serious genetic disease of the heart. Because the cardiac beta-MHC is also expressed in slow-twitch fibers of skeletal muscle, we have been able to study the mechanical properties associated with these myosin mutations in single skeletal muscle fibers obtained from HCM patients. We found that the normal and the mutant copy of the beta-MHC gene are on average equally expressed within single slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers. Furthermore, we found that three distinct missense mutations in the beta-MHC gene that cause HCM produce either no change or only a small decrease in isometric force output of single slow-twitch skeletal muscle cells. In summary, these results demonstrate that isometric force production by myosin mutants need not be affected to cause HCM. ',\n",
       " '(1) Role of Energy-dependent Proteases in Protein Quality Control and Cell Regulation. All cells must be capable of degrading aberrant and foreign proteins that would otherwise pollute them. Programmed degradation of regulatory factors also contributes to controlling the cell cycle and to generating peptides for immune presentation. These activities are all carried out by energy-dependent proteases, which generically consist of two parts - a peptidase and a chaperone-like ATPase. For several years, our studies focussed on the Clp proteases of E. coli, considered as a model system. We showed that the peptidase ClpP consists of two apposed heptameric rings and the cognate ATPase - either ClpA or ClpX - is a single hexameric ring. ClpA X stack axially on one or both faces of ClpP to form active complexes. We went on to show that substrate proteins bind to distal sites on the ATPase and are then translocated axially into the digestion chamber inside ClpP. In FY07, we initiated a project to investigate the mobility of the N-terminal domains of ClpA that we had previously shown to undergo large fluctuations in the region distal to the hexameric ring of ATPase domains. The N-domains are connected to the ATPase domains by a flexible linker. Our working hypothesis is that shortening this linker will reduce the N-domain mobility, rendering them more visible in electron micrographs. Initial results with a 10- residue deletion mutant support this hypothesis. The proteosome is the machine responsible for ubiquitin-tagged protein degradation in eukaryotes. The 26S proteasome is composed by the 20s proteolytic chamber and the 19S complex which is involved in substrate binding and translocation into the 20s. The 19S complex comprises multiple regulatory proteins. We have begun to work on two of these, called rpn1 and rpn2. Both proteins lack ATPase activity and their functions are still unclear. A bioinformatics analysis has predicted that both proteins have alpha-solenoid folds, organized in a \"croissant\"-like shape. From negative staining EM and image averaging, we have obtained a representation of rpn2 that conforms to this expectation, and indicates four subdomains. (2a) Intracellular Trafficking: Interaction of Clathrin with Proteins that Regulate its Assembly. Clathrin plays a key role in intracellular trafficking, via its coating of membranous pits and vesicles (CCVs). Assembly of clathrin is promoted by accessory proteins such as auxilin and AP180, and disassembly is effected by the Hsc70 ATPase. In the 1980s, we studied the molecular composition of coated vesicles and the plasticity of the assembly unit, the clathrin triskelion. We returned to this system in FY05, equipped with cryo-EM technology, and compared the structures of coated vesicles with and without binding of the uncoating ATPase, Hsc70. From these observations, we developed a model for uncoating. In FY07, we extended studies initiated during the previous year in which cryo-electron tomography is used to study the structures of individual CCVs isolated from bovine brain. Their polyhedral coats surround vesicles carrying cargoes of various shapes and sizes, including neurotransmitters, receptors and viruses. The tomograms divide coated particles into two sub-populations: 19% have internal vesicles and are true CCVs, and 81% lack internal membranes and so are clathrin baskets (CBs). The CCVs range from 80 to 134 nm in diameter, with vesicles of 30 to 68 nm. The CBs range from 66 to 120 nm, with those smaller than 80 nm too small to enclose the smallest vesicle (30 nm). The coats may be described by the symmetry of their polygonal facets. While many small polyhedral forms are possible in theory, many of them are not observed, suggesting that these forms are energetically disfavored. The common feature of these forbidden small polyhedra is that they have vertices with high curvature, placing a limit on how much the triskelion is able to bend. The smallest particle observed is a 28 vertex tetrahedral form, while the smallest CCV has 38 vertices with a 30 nm vesicle. In CCVs, the coat can be coupled to the vesicle through various proteins, of which the bulk are adaptor proteins. In our tomograms we see density between the clathrin N-termini and the membrane, with many shapes and sizes consistent with known structures of adaptor proteins. The vesicle is always located off-center relative to the coat, possibly reflecting the polarity inherent in how these vesicles bud off during endocytosis. In many CVs, the membrane is actually in contact with the clathrin N-termini, suggesting that clathrin itself may be able to interact directly with the membrane. (2b) Intracellular Trafficking: The Retromer Cargo-recognition Complex. The retromer is required for numerous intracellular transactions, such as the sorting of acid hydrolases to lysosomes, transcytosis of the polymeric Ig receptor, Wnt gradient formation, iron transporter recycling, and processing of the amyloid precursor protein. Human retromer consists of two smaller complexes, the cargo-recognition complex and a membrane-targeting complex. We are participating in a study to define the structures of these subcomplexes, their interactions in the fully assembled retromer, and their interactions with targeted membranes. The cargo-recognition complex is a heterotrimer of three proteins, Vps26, Vps29 and Vps35. The crystal structure of a subcomplex of Vps29 and a C-terminal fragment of Vps35 shows that the latter molecule forms a horseshoe-shaped alpha-helical solenoid. From bioinformatic analysis, we infer that the same fold is observed through the rest of Vps35. This prediction is supported by electron microscopy and image processing of the intact Vps26-Vps29-Vps35 complex which is revealed as a somewhat flexible, filamentous structure, 21 nm long. A model that synthesizes all currently available data shows the alpha-solenoid extending along the full length of Vps35, with Vps26 bound at the opposite end from Vps29. This elongated structure presents multiple binding sites for the membrane-targeting complex and receptor cargo.',\n",
       " 'The high affinity receptor for IgE on mast cells and basophils (FcEpsilonRI) plays a central role in immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Aggregation of receptor-bound IgE by polyvalent antigen leads to aggregation of the receptors and cellular secretion of both preformed and newly synthesized mediators of inflammation. The molecular mechanisms by which aggregation of the receptors generate these cellular responses are the central focus of our studies. During the past year we focussed on three principal areas: 1) Developing improved methods for discovering proteins other than the subunits of the receptor which might be associated with the receptor either prior to or as a consequence of aggregation. 2) Exploring various aspects of how aggregation may initiate a biochemical cascade, in vitro systems. 3) Devising a procedure that would permit an assessment of the lifetime of activated receptors. 4) Exploring the role of protein kinase C in the phosphorylation of the receptor. Our new results show: 1) Using chemical crosslinking reagents substantial quantities of other cellular proteins (including the src-like kinase lyn) appear to be associated with the receptor. Aggregation of the receptors prior to crosslinking does not lead to substantial differences in the pattern of associated proteins. 2) Conditions have been developed that allow one to observe in vitro a) Substantially enhanced tyrosine kinase activity in receptors that had been aggregated in vivo but only so long as the receptors remain aggregated, b) Evidence that the in vitro phosphorylation of the receptors occurs via a transphosphorylation. 3) Contrary to the proposals of others, aggregated receptors have a substantial half-life of activation. 4) Protein kinase C is implicated in the phosphorylation of the gamma but not of the beta chain of the receptor.

       " 'Lewis rats are highly susceptible to bacterial cell wall arthritis, but Fischer rats are relatively resistant. We have previously provided data suggesting that this difference was related to blunted hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) responsiveness in the Lewis rat. During the past year, we have continued to characterize the neuroendocrine defect in the Lewis rat compared to the Fischer rat and are relating it to the development of inflammation in response to streptococcal cell walls or lipopolysaccharide. In particular, we have continued to characterize corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) expressed in peripheral tissues. We have demonstrated the presence of high levels in the inflamed joints of Lewis rats that contrasts with the low levels in arthritis-resistant Fischer rats. Our available data suggest that CRH is produced by macrophages and is also delivered to the inflammatory site through the peripheral nervous system. We have also demonstrated that HPA axis responses to LPS also differ markedly in the 2 rat strains. We are relating these differences in HPA axis function to the expression of various cytokine genes and cycyclooxygenase -1 and -2. These latter studies are not yet complete, but we have developed methods to quantitate the expression of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, which we believe, like CRH, is intimately involved in regulating both inflammatory and HPA axis responses.

We have over the past several years, seen and studied and collected serum, blood, and muscle specimens from well over 450 patients suspected of having myositis. We have collected epidemiologic information on many patients. We have cloned, sequenced, and expressed histidyl-TRNA synthetase HRS, the principal target autoantigen in idiopathic polymyositis and dermatomyositis and are analyzing its structure and promoter. We have extended the analysis of HLA antigens in the sets of myositis patients defined by autoantibodies using the sequence specific oligonucleotide hybridization PCR method. We have analyzed promoter activity of the HRS gene and are currently investigating translational control of its synthesis. We have successfully obtained high level expression of HRS, purified it, and crystallized it. A sensitive, specific, stable ELISA has been developed and a patent applied for. In collaboration with Dr. Terry O'Hanlan and Dr. Frederick Miller, we have analyzed T cell receptor usage in the muscle of some patients with myositis. \",\n",

       " ' Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a rheumatic disease characterized by intermittent bouts of fever with abdominal pain, pleurisy, and or arthritis; some patients also develop systemic amyloidosis, leading eventually to renal failure. FMF is inherited as a single autosomal recessive gene (designated MEF), but the biochemical lesion is unknown. The purpose of this project has been to identify the FMF gene by the method of positional cloning. By the beginning of the current year, we had succeeded in mapping the gene causing FMF to the short arm of chromosome 16. During 1992-3 we have considerable refined the genetic mapping of MEF. After examining 12 genetic markers from distal chromosome 16p, we have narrowed the candidate region to the interval between D16S63 and D16S246, a genetic distance of 3.4 Cm (sex-averaged). Moreover, we have identified a highly informative new microsatellite polymorphism at D16S63 that allows rapid haplotyping of FMF families with small amounts of DNA. To define genetic distances in this region more precisely, we have also typed the CEPH reference families for this new microsatellite, as well as D16S80, D16S246, and D16S283. Among our 51 non-Ashkenazi Jewish FMF families there are at least 4 recombinants on the centromeric end of the D16S63-D16S246 interval, indicating the potential to narrow the region of interest even more. We found that FMF in Arabs maps to the same interval, thus increasing the potential pool of informative families. We have used two additional strategies aimed at localizing MEF: linkage disequilibrium mapping and homozygosity mapping. Previous studies of linkage disequilibrium at D16S94, D16S283, and D16S291 had indicated a probable founder effect among Moroccan Jewish FMF families, but no allelic associations in other subpopulations. More recent typings for D16S246, which is closer to MEF than the other three markers, does indicate strong allelic associations in all Jewish subpopulations studied. This suggests that MEF is closer to the telomeric side of the D16S63-D16S246 interval. Homozygosity mapping is a novel strategy for mapping recessively inherited disease genes in inbred families. With our large panel of consanguineous families, we did find high levels of homozygosity in affected offspring of inbred marriages for a number of loci on chromosome 16p. However, we found this strategy to have limited utility for refined mapping, because of the high gene frequency for FMF, and the relatively low heterozygosities of markers in the region. ',\n",
       " 'The structure, function and expression of the kertin intermediate filaments of human and mouse skin, and the related intermediate filament proteins of other cell types, are being investigated. These studies are designed to understand the structural features that determine how the rod domains of the chains pack to form the filament core. We have used cross-linking studies to determine molecular lengths and the nearest neighbor molecular alignments in the filaments. An assay involving synthetic peptides has been designed to explore the features of the filament models. The glycine-rich end domains of especially the keratin 1 10 filaments of epidermal cells are unique in biology. We believe these organize into a glycine-loop configuration. Current studies are designed to determine how these are packed and how they might interact with other macromolecules coexpressed in epidermal tissues. The glycine- loop sequences on the human keratin 10 chain are extraordinarily polymorphic in size and sequence. Using genomic clones to the human keratin chains 1 and 10, transgenic mice have been constructed to examine the expression characteristics of the genes as well as to probe in vivo the likely functions of the various portions of the chains, such as rod domain segments and glycine-rich end domains.

       " 'The cornified cell envelope constitutes a multi-component 15 nm thick layer of highly insoluble protein on the inside of the plasma membrane of terminally differentiated epithelial cells. Based on a variety of data, we now know that loricrin is a major component of the epidermal cell envelope. It is crosslinked to the envelope by way of N~-(~- glutamyl)lysine isodipeptide crosslinks, catalyzed by the action of transglutaminases. Loricrins are glycine-rich proteins that contain the highly flexible glycine loop motif. We have expressed human locricrin in a baculovirus system to study its biochemical properties and the mechanism(s) by which it is crosslinked. In order to study its precise role in the epidermis, and the regulation of its expression, we have used transgenic technology. A construct containing the full-length human gene and flanking sequences can direct the proper site- and stage-specific over-expression of human loricrin in transgenic mice. Since the mice are normal, loricrin is presumably a very late, if not the last, component to be added to the cell envelope. ',\n",

In the epidermis, and other stratified squamous epithelial tissues, these enzymes are thought to be involved in the crosslinking of putative protein components to form the insoluble cell envelope. Using molecular biology approaches, we have found that there are 3 different transglutaminase activities in normal human and mouse epidermis. These are known as the K(TGase1), C(TGase2) and E(TGase3) enzymes. We have isolated and characterized CDNA clones encoding full-length Tgase1 and Tgase3 systems. The complete genomic structure (14.1kbp) of the Tgase1 systems has been completed. Work is in progress on the genomic structure of the Tgase3 gene. Full length and deletion constructs of the Tgase1 and Tgase3 enzymes have been expressed in E. coli and in mammalian cells in an effort to understand the structural functional domains. The aim of all of these studies is to determine the likely functions of these different activities in normal epidermis, and whether or how these may be involved in pathology. ',\n",
       " 'Rats are an important experimental model for many human diseases, many of which have a genetic component. As followup of our previous and ongoing work demonstrating impressive differences in the phenotypic responses of LEW and F344 rats to proinflammatory and noninflammatory stimuli, we are developing a genetic linkage map for rats, specifically applicable to these rat strains. We have now identified 250 polymorphisms and have mapped about 200 of these to 17 of 20 rat chromosomes using an F2 intercross of F344 x LEW parents. We do not yet have markers for 3 rat chromsomes. We have demonstrated impressive conservation of synteny between rat, mouse and human chromosomes. We have also extended our efforts to identify polymorphisms to 13 additional inbred strains of rats. Importantly, we have identified approximately an additional 150 polymorphic markers that differ between the LEW and inbred BN rats, another relatively autoimmune disease resistant rat strain. In summary, we have markedly increased our ability to chromosomally localize genes that control important phenotypic traits in rats. Moreover, these markers are highly useful for genetic monitoring of inbred rat strains. As part of our effort to localize the athymic nude gene in the rat, we have genomically cloned, sequenced and mapped the rat epimorphin gene to chromosome 12 and have excluded it as a candidate locus for the rat athymic nude trait, which has been localized to chromosome 10.

       " 'Trichohyalin is a major differentiation product of the inner root sheath cells of the hair follicle, where it is initially deposited in large dense granules, termed trichohyalin granules. Subsequently, during terminal differentiation, it is dispersed and becomes associated with the keratin intermediate filaments of the inner root-sheath cells. Thus it seems to serve largely as an intermediate filaments associated protein in this tissue. It is also expressed in the medulla of coarser hairs where it does not interact with filaments, but rather changes into a loose amorphous product. Trichohyalin is of interest because it is a major substrate for transglutaminases, and it also undergoes postsynthetic modifications of certain of its arginine residues to citrullines. Of especial interest is the recent observation that trichohyalin is also expressed in the epidermis, but its role in epidermal differentiation and role in pathology remain to be elucidated. We have obtained a CDNA clone by PCR analysis of genomic DNA and have used this as a probe to isolate the human trichohyalin gene. The human trichohalin protein consists largely of a series of quasi-repeating peptides, and interestingly like profilaggrin, its amino terminus contains two functional calcium-binding domains of the EF-hand type. Our interest in this system is to explore its role as a transglutaminase substrate, as a major calcium-binding protein, as an important new intermediate filament associated protein, and its role, if any, pathology.

       " ' A common feature of inflammatory disease is the central role of Fc receptors and immune complexes and the high levels of cytokines produced, which serve to recruit other immune cells thus amplifying the response. Understanding how Fc receptors communicate intracellular signals to initiate cytokine responses and how the released cytokines contribute to inflammation is the major focus of our efforts. Our previous efforts have identified several proteins that are important in the regulation of gene expression initiated by IgE Fc receptor stimulation. We have focused on signaling proteins that may serve as possible links from Fc receptor to gene expression and mast cell degranulation. Objectives: In the past year our objectives were as follows: 1. To investigate whether receptor proximal kinases play a positive or negative regulatory role in promoting mast cell function. We engaged in this topic of investigation based on the observation that genetic deletion of Lyn kinase results in a hyper-responsive mast cell whereas genetic deletion of Fyn kinase causes hypo-responsiveness. 2. To investigate whether Lyn association with the IgE Fc receptor beta chain has both positive and negative consequences in mast cell effector responses. This line of investigation was based on our prior finding that Lyn phosphorylates multiple intracellular proteins that could function to both augment or inhibit mast cell responses. 3. To investigate the importance of sphingosine kinase in mast cell function. These studies were initiated based on a prior study demonstrating a role for this kinase in mast cell function. Results: The objectives of the past year were met in the following manner. First, our studies on the role of receptor proximal kinases revealed that Lyn kinase has a primary role as a negative regulator of mast cell responsiveness. We found that mice deficient in Lyn showed an allergic-like phenotype that mirrored atopic allergic disease by increased IgE production and increased expression of IgE Fc receptors on the surface of the mast cell. Our studies on the role of the IgE Fc receptor beta chain in regulating mast cell function revealed that the function of this subunit is to amplify mast cell degranulation but also to negatively control mast cell cytokine production. These studies revealed that loss of SHIP-1 (a lipid phosphatase) phosphorylation, due to the loss of Lyn association with receptor, is the likely defect that causes increased NF kappa B activation and cytokine production. Finally, our studies on the role of sphingosine kinases demonstrated that two sphingosine kinases are activated upon IgE Fc receptor engagement and that this requires the activity of both Lyn and Fyn kinases. The product of sphingosine kinase activity, sphingosine-1-phosphate, is important for normal mast cell degranulation and chemotaxis. This work revealed the interdependence of Src and sphinogosine kinase family members in IgE-dependent mast cell function and suggest that this is a common mechanism for immune cells. Conclusions and Significance: In summary, we found that Lyn kinase functions primarily as a negative regulator of mast cell responsiveness whereas Fyn kinase functions as a positive regulator whose activity is essential to mast cell function. Our studies demonstrate that the association of Lyn with the IgE Fc receptor is important in negative regulation of cytokine production. Loss of this interaction resulted in only partial inhibition of mast cell degranulation demonstrating a role for other signaling molecules. Our findings point to Fyn kinase as the key positive regulator since its genetic deletion in the presence or absence of Lyn causes loss of mast cell degranulation. Our studies have also identified a complementary family of receptors whose transactivation following IgE Fc receptor stimulation is important for full mast cell responses and chemotaxis. The studies demonstrated that generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate is key for normal mast cell function and this is regulated through activation-dependent coupling of sphingosine kinases to the IgE receptor by Fyn and Lyn. In the coming year, we will focus on further understanding the role of Fyn and Lyn kinase in mast cell function with particular emphasis as to whether they play a role in human allergic and autoimmune disease. We also will further explore the importance of sphingosine kinases in immune cell function since the production of S1P has been demonstrated to be enhanced in several diseases including asthma and cancer.',\n",
       " 'Cytokines are secreted proteins that regulate cell growth and differentiation. These factors are especially important in regulating immune and inflammatory responses. Specific cytokines are critical for lymphoid development, differentiation, homeostasis, tolerance, and memory. Thus understanding the molecular basis of cytokine action can provide important insights on the pathogenesis of immune-mediated disease as well as offer new therapeutic targets. We discovered the human tyrosine kinase, Jak3, which is essential for signaling by a major class of immunoregulatory cytokines, those that bind the common gamma chain, gc (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21). We found that mutation of gc or Jak3 results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and in this fiscal year, we reported 10 new individuals from 7 unrelated families who exhibited new Jak3 mutations. We described the clinical presentation of these patients and assessed the structure function consequences of the specific mutations. Nine of the 10 patients are currently well following stem cell transplantation, with all exhibiting normal T cell function. However, restoration of antibody function was only noted in a minority of patients and natural killer function was severely depressed at presentation and remained impaired in most patients. A major objective of the laboratory is the understanding the structure and function of Jak3, in vitro and in vivo. Using patient derived mutations as a tool, we have studied the trafficking of Jak3 and gc in living cell using fluorescent fusion proteins. We found that Jak3-GFP is cytosolic and cannot traffic to the plasma membrane without its cognate receptor, gc. The structural requirements for the proper localization of Jak3 are quite stringent. We demonstrated that the amino-terminal band four point one, ezrin, radixin, moiesin (FERM) domain is necessary for receptor association, it is not sufficient; indeed the entire Jak3 molecule is required. Kinase activity is not required, but a number of mutants that disrupt kinase activity do affect trafficking. In addition, several additional patient-derived and artificial mutants were found to disrupt trafficking, including mutations in the pseudokinase domain and the putative SH2 domain. In related studies, we have also defined the major sites of autophosphorylation within Jak3. We have recently mapped one site as being an important means by which the adapter molecule SH2Bb is bound. After the discovery of Jak3, our group established a CRADA with Pfizer, the goal being the generation of a selective, clinically usefully Jak3 antagonist as a new class of immunosuppressant. Such a compound has now been generated and was tested in two transplant models, mouse and primate; in both settings the drug was effective in blocking transplant rejection. Importantly, the drug has an approximately 20-100 fold selectivity for Jak3 compared to other Jaks. This is important because inhibition of Jak1 and especially Jak2 would be expected to be associated with significant clinical toxicities including anemia, thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. Both in vitro and in cell-based assays, Jak2 signaling was relatively spared. In animals, the drug was associated with only mild anemia. Following the activation of Jaks by cytokines, the next step in signaling is the activation of a family of transcription factors called Stats (signal transducers and activators of transcription). We have recently found that gene targeted mice that completely lack Stat5A and Stat5B, have major disruptions of T and B cell development. Thus, we conclude, Stat5, like Jak3 and gc, is essential for proper lymphoid development in large measure as a major mediator of IL-7s actions. More detailed analysis of these mice and the role of Stat5 in immunity is underway. The second major area of investigation is the control of helper T (Th) cell differentiation and the regulation of cell-mediated immunity. Several factors regulate this process including the cytokine IL-12, which we discovered to activate the Janus kinases, Tyk2 and Jak2 and the transcription factor Stat4. The activation of this pathway leads to production of another key cytokine, IFN-gamma, which is critical for host defense against intracellular pathogens. To delineate ithe transcriptional control mechanism(s) that regulate IFN-gamma mRNA expression, we mapped a DNase hypersensitivity site approximately 3.5 - 4.0 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays we identified cytokine-inducible histone H3 acetylation in this region. Within this distal region we found a Stat5 binding site, which we demonstrated using chromatin immunoprecipitation. These data lead us to conclude that this distal region serves as both a target of chromatin remodeling in the IFNG locus as well as a cytokine-induced transcriptional enhancer that binds Stat5 proteins. We next compared and contrasted histone acetylation and mRNA expression for three key Th1-expressed genes, IFNG, TBET, and IL18RAP and found them to be distinctly regulated. The TBET and the IFNG genes, but not the IL18RAP gene showed preferential acetylation of histones H3 and H4 during TH1 differentiation. Analysis of acetylation of specific histone residues revealed that H3(K9), H4(K8), and H4(K12) were preferentially modified in TH1 cells, suggesting a possible contribution of acetylation of these residues for induction of these genes. On the other hand, the acetylation of IL18RAP gene occurred both in TH1 and TH2 cells with the similar kinetics and on the same residues. In addition, histone H3 acetylation of IFNG and TBET genes occurred with different kinetics however, and was distinctively regulated by cytokines indicating that histone acetylation during TH1 differentiation is a process that is regulated by various factors at multiple levels. We also found that histone acetylation of the IFNG could occur independently of TBET through the use of Tbet knockout mice. Finally, we found that treating Th2 cells with a histone deacetylation inhibitor,restored histone acetylation of the IFNG and TBET genes, but not fully restore their expression in TH2 cells, indicating that histone acetylation explains one but not all the aspects of TH1 specific gene expression. In efforts to better understand target genes activated by cytokines, we utilized microarray technology to identify genes selectively induced by IL-12. We demonstrated that a relatively small number of genes is selectively induced by IL-12, compared to other cytokines like IL-2 and Type I interferon, a finding that argues for an instructive model of cytokine action as opposed to the stochastic models proposed by some workers. One gene that we identified in these microarray studies that was of particular interest is the serine threonine kinase Cot Tpl2. This kinase is directly inducible by IL-12 and inhibited by IL-4; accordingly, it is preferentially expressed in Th1 cells. Using Cot Tp12 knock out mice and siRNA to knock down Cot Tpl2 levels, we showed that Cot Tpl2 is important in interferon gamma gene regulation. We identified a number of other genes that we hope will improve our understanding of the cell biology of helper T cell differentiation.',\n",

Patients with known or suspected psoriatic arthritis are evaluated at the Clinical Center. Studies include characterization of the clinical and laboratory features of the disease, research studies of the natural history, pathogenesis and determination of the patients' eligibility to enter experimental therapeutic protocols. Results: Recruitment in this study was slow over the last year primarily because the beneficial effect and wide availability and ongoing clinical trials of new TNF-inhibitors in the community.

       " 'Congenital craniofacial malformations can be caused by a large number of factors; genetic, environmental or the interplay of both. Recent progress in linkage analyses and positional cloning have identified many genetic mutations associated with human craniofacial syndromes. However, the mechanisms of how such mutations in a gene result in an altered phenotype require the molecular dissection of the signal transduction pathway in tissues and cells that are elements of craniofacial development. We are particularly interested in skeletogenesis since 25% of all congenital malformations involve the skeleton. We have initiated 5 subtopics focussing on the different aspects of skeletogenesis, including transcriptional control of chondrogenesis, cell adhesion and cytoskeletal signal transduction in chondrocyte differentiation, cranial neural crest cell migration and differentiation, differentiative pathway of osteo-chondro-progenitor cells under compressive force and the generation of monoclonal antibodies against stage specific chondrocyte markers. These subtopics are independent areas of research, yet collectively are interrelated scientifically and technically to address some of the key questions in the field of craniofacial development. It is our goal that through these subtopics, we will be able to identify signal transduction pathways elicited by intrinsic factors such as transcriptional activation, and extrinsic factors such as cell-cell interactions and cell-substrate interactions, leading to early events of chondrogenesis. We will also extrapolate our knowledge of normal chondrogenesis to elucidate the etiology of various forms of genetic diseases and disorders of the cartilage, for the development of preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

The proteins are selected which are important for the life cycle of the virus and for its structural integrity and, thus, represent potential targets for rational structure-based drug design. Collaborating groups performed the actual structure determinations. The determination of the 3-D structure of proteins by X-ray diffraction or multidimensional NMR required the production of large quantities of highly purified and physically homogeneous protein. In addition, protein structure determination by NMR requires protein biosynthetically labeled with combinations of the stable isotopes: H-2, C-13 and N-15.

       " ' The envelope glycoprotein of the human (HIV) and related simian (SIV) immunodeficiency virus are synthesized as gp160 precursors which are processed into two non-covalently associated glycoproteins: gp120 and gp41. The gp120 mediates viral entry into the host cell by binding to the cellular receptor CD4 and a chemokine co-receptor, both of which are located on the host cell surface. This binding induces conformational changes in the transmembrane gp41, which facilitates membrane fusion between the viral and host membranes. An understanding of these processes at the molecular level may lead to a direct means of inhibiting HIV infection. HIV gp41, and the closely related SIV gp41, are heavily glycosylated transmembrane proteins. The ectodomain region, located on the outer surface of the viral membrane directly mediates membrane fusion events via an N-terminal fusion domain. Both the NMR and X-ray structures of the gp41 ectodomain have been solved. The structure determined by both methods is a rod-like trimer comprising three parallel N-terminal alpha-helices assembled as a coiled-coil in the center with three antiparallel C-terminal alpha-helices packed on the outside with highly flexible loops connecting the inner and outer helices. Results: To gain further insight into gp41 function we have expressed in bacteria regions of the protein for which there is currently no structural information, namely, the extremely hydrophobic N-terminal fusion peptide, the transmembrane region and the long cytoplasmic domain. The proteins produced are being studied by new NMR techniques designed for the structural analysis of membrane proteins and peptides (A.Bax). The structure of a membrane associated region of the cytoplasmic domain was previously determined and the structure of the N-terminal fusion domain has now been determined and has been submitted for publication. We have also prepared site-specific mutants of the helical N-terminal fusion domain which abrogate the fusion process and structural studies indicate corresponding perturbations of the helical structure. These studies will also be submitted for publication soon. In other published studies we have examined mutants of the HIV gp41 ectodomain which are resistant to the new class of peptide inhibitors targeted against membrane fusion. We have shown that the resistance mutations increase the thermodynamic stability of the gp41 ectodomain and these results provides new insight into the potential mechanism of resistance. Significance and future direction: More detailed structure determinations of the whole gp41 protein including the transmembrane region and the large cytoplasmic domain will provide more targets for rational drug design.',\n",

The HBV core gene codes for precore protein (pre-C) which is either partially processed to form a secreted non-particulate protein called e-antigen (HBeAg) or fully processed to produce core antigen (HBcAg). HBcAg is a 183-residue protein that encapsidate around a RNA-reverse transcriptase complex (HBV polymerase). HBcAg has been expressed in E.coli were it assembles in the bacterial cytoplasm into icosahedral capsids, which contain bound host nucleic acid. Deletion of the polybasic C-terminal 34 residues (protamine domain) also produces assembly competent protein. The capsids from C-terminal truncated protein (Cp149: residues 1-149) do not contain nucleic acid and their structure determined by cryo-electron microscopy and image analysis and by X-ray crystallography. Native HBeAg is also C-terminally truncated at position 149 and in addition contains a 10 residue N-terminal extension derived from partial processing of pre-C. Although the function and structure of HBeAg are unclear it is an important serological marker. Results: using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore), a kinetic-affinity map of a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against HBV nucleocapsid proteins revealed a range of binding affinities. Monoclonal antibodies binding to the assembled and non-assembled forms of the capsids were identified. Some of the HBV nucleocapsid-antibody complexes were characterized further by cryo-electron microscopy (A. Steven).

Biophysical and structural studies on HBeAg are continuing using mutants with improved biophysical characteristics, especially solubility. We are preparing immune complexes of HBeAg with monoclonal antibodies to enhance crystal formation and subsequent structural studies using X-ray crystallography. Work is also continuing on our attempts to produce the HBV polymerase protein. We have also initiated studies on the HBV protein X, a key regulatory protein of the virus that is at the intersection of HBV infection, replication, pathogenesis, and possibly carcinogenesis.

An understanding of the molecular structure of the HBV nucleocapsid and other essential viral proteins including the polymerase and the X protein would allow targeted drug discovery with the aim of preventing the assembly and formation of the virus. A clearer understanding of the structural differences between the clinical HBV markers: HBcAg and HBeAg could result in better diagnostic tools.',\n",
       " 'Titin and nebulin are unprecedented giant proteins discovered and named in this laboratory. Our recent work has focused on the roles of titin and nebulin in the structure, regulation, mechanics and assembly of sarcomeres in striated muscles. We have employed a multidisciplinary approach that draws on methodologies and concepts of biochemistry, biophysics, cell and molecular biology, and physiology. (A). Titin: A primary theme of our research is the understanding of the structural and physiological roles of titin, a family of giant structural proteins that constitute an elastic matrix in the striated muscle sarcomeres and some nonmuscle cells. Titin and the elastic matrix may play major physiological roles, including the genesis of long range elasticity, the maintenance of sarcomere stability, the assembly of nascent sarcomeres in developing muscle cells, and the assembly of myosin in the microfilaments in nonmuscle cells. The following questions of central importance are being addressed: 1.How do titin filaments respond to stretch and release We are refining our working hypothesis that the segmental extensibility of titin underlies its capacity as a multistage molecular spring. Site-specific monoclonal antibodies to various titin sequence domains have been prepared and applied in immunoelectron microscopy to delineate the order, locus and degree of titin extension in skeletal, cardiac and flight muscles. 2. What is the molecular basis of titin elasticity We are testing the hypothesis that specific and reversible unfolding of domains and uncoiling of titin filaments underlies its capacity as a molecular spring. The elasticity of isolated titin and analogous elastic molecules from skeletal and cardiac and flight muscles are being measured directly, as single molecules and as gel networks, with laser trap techniques, atomic force microscopy and rheometric techniques. The conformation of titin domains and synthetic peptides will be studied by high resolution NMR and X-ray crystallography. Titin elasticity will be explained in the context of statistical theories of polymers and realistic structural features of titin domains. 3.Do thin filaments modulate titin elasticity We are searching for transient or stable interactions of titin with actin, tropomyosin, troponin, nebulin and other thin filament proteins. Mechanical measurements will be done on muscles in which actins in thin filaments have been selectively removed by gelsolin as well as on fibers that have been reconstituted with selected regulatory proteins to evaluate the thin filament\\'s contribution to elasticity in situ. 4. Does titin participate in the regulation of actin-myosin interactions The effect of titin on the actin-myosin interactions in solution will be evaluated by ATPase activity, in vitro motility assays, and molecular force measurements. In the past year, we have succeeded in revealing, for the first time, that the elastic PEVK segment of titin is modular in construction, display repeating proline II helix coil conformational motifs and most importantly, interact with thin filaments in a calcium S100 sensitive manner. These observations established the conformational basis of titin PEVK elasticity and identified PEVK as a site of interfilament interaction and that S100 or calcium sensor proteins regulate interaction and titin elasticity. In this past year, we have discovered that titin PREV segment is a giant force sensing molecule of the SH3 signaling pathways. High resolution structures of a homopolymer of a PEVK module in solution and in gel phase has been determined by NMR techniques. The extensive differential splicing of titin PEVK exons in various human heart muscles was elucidated. (B). Nebulin: Nebulin is thought to act as a protein ruler that regulates the length of actin filaments in skeletal muscle sarcomeres. Our recent studies indicate that nebulin tethers myosin heads to actin in a calcium calmodulin sensitive manner, raising the intriguing possibility that nebulin may act as a calcium-linked regulatory protein that is distinct from the classic troponin tropomyosin system. 1. How does nebulin regulate the length of thin filaments The length, mass and sequence of nebulin size isoforms will be compared with thin filament lengths of a wide range of skeletal muscles in developing and adult muscles. In particular, we will test the hypothesis that both the number of nebulin repeats and the presence of a specific N-terminal termination sequence are necessary to give rise to uniform thin filament length distribution within each sarcomere. The effect of purified native nebulin on the length distribution of polymerizing or performed actin filaments will be monitored by electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy to test the length regulating ability of nebulin and other potential cofactors. At a later stage, chimeric constructs consisting of sequence motifs from distinct nebulin will be produced and assayed to fine-tune their length regulating property. 2. How does nebulin regulate actin-myosin interaction The kinetics of nebulin on ATPase activities will be studied by stop flow methods to define plausible molecular mechanisms of action. The influence of nebulin and calcium calmodulin on the sliding velocity of actin over myosin will be investigated by in vitro motility assays to reveal the effect of nebulin on mechanical coupling of myosin motors. The search for other potential calcium mediators will be done by affinity chromatography and blotting. We are particularly interested in the possible involvement of S100 proteins as well as the kinase phosphotase that phosphorylate nebulin as physiological effectors of actin myosin interaction. Single muscle mechanics will be carried out to test if nebulin affects the shortening velocity or resting stiffness of skeletal muscles. Ultimately, calcium regulation of active tension, active stiffness and shortening velocity will be studied in muscle fibers that are reconstituted with distinct nebulin isoforms or chimeras. We have succeeded in purifying full-length native nebulin as well as nebulin-containing native thin filaments. Collaborative efforts have been initiated to apply cryoEM techniques to study the 3D images of such \"composite\" thin filaments, with and without myosin decoration. These studies are beginning to reveal if and how nebulin participates in the steric blocking of myosin on actin. Additionally, atomic force microscopy has been used to study both the morphology as well as the molecular forces of interactions between actin, myosin and nebulin. The synthesis and incorporation of titin, nebulin nebulette into sarcomeres of developing skeletal and cardiac muscle cells in culture has being examined with immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Nonmuscle nebulin family members such as cortactin and LASP are being investigated for their roles in cell motility.',\n",
       " 'Spectacular advances in the ability to manipulate, fabricate and alter tiny subjects at the nanometer scale (Nanotechnology) have revolutionized material science in the past decade. The recent application of nanotechnology to life sciences has shown exciting promises in a wide range of disciplines. The development of laser-based technology (confocal microscope, laser tweezers, laser scissors, mutilphoton excitation confocal microscope, near field microscope, etc.) now allows functional imaging of living cells in thick tissues; the manipulation of single molecules, single organelles and single cells; the determination of the binding force and rate of interaction of DNA and other single molecules; the surgery of chromosomes and organelles in a living cell and the fabrication of miniature medical devices. The development of scanning probe microscopy (atomic force, scanning tunneling and electrochemical probe, near field microscopy) has enabled the manipulation of single molecules, the preparation of novel biochips and biosensors, and the measurement of physical and spectroscopic properties of single molecules in living cells. Our workgroup have succeeded in establishing state-of-the-art nanotechnology facilities (atomic force microscope, cellular force microscope, single fiber force station, real time confocal microscope, single molecule fluorescence microscope, and digital image analysis) to apply, adapt and develop bio-nanotechnology. These techniques are being applied to study single motors such as myosin and kinesin as well elastic proteins such a titin and nebulin, muscle filaments, cytoskeletal filaments, receptors in cellular membranes and cellular organelles such as myofibril, ribosome and chromatin. More specifically, our goals are: 1. Measuring the mechanical property and spectroscopy of single molecules, organelles and single cells. 2. Measuring the strength, speed and movement of interacting single molecules organelles cells. 3. Manipulating and altering intracellular organelles in living cells. 4. Fabricating and designing new instrumentation in nanotechnology. These direct measurement and manipulation of single molecule and filaments and organelles will provide unique and important insights of the events in the assembly and function of contractile machinery in muscle and nonmuscle cells. These studies will also reveal important engineering principles for designing tissues with prescribed mechanical properties. In the past year, we have successfully applied atomic force microscopy to image and measure the elastic properties of single monomeric protein, oligomeric protein and genetically engineered titin and nebulin molecules. We are also applying the single molecule fluorescence microscope to study the morphology and dynamic interactions of titin, nebulin, actin and myosin motors at the single molecule level. In this report year, we have made major progress in 1. Understanding how titin PEVK , nebulin and myosin develops and modulates elasticity by correlating single molecule mechanical measurements with conformational states. 2. The development of an AFM that measure dynamics stiffness and force simultaneously in aqueous solutions. 3. The engineering of protein polymers based on selected PEVK modules to obtain defined elastic properties. These polymers also formed the basis for drug delivery hydrogels. 4. The development of protein nanopatterning techniques using self assembled monolyaers and nanolithograpgy. These techniques have greatly expedited the accurate and reproducible nanomechanical measurement of single proteins.',\n",
       " 'Recent advances in protein separation, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics have enabled the simultaneous analysis of a large number of proteins in cells and tissues. The interaction of these proteins, especially those that respond to specific challenges, are rapidly identified by ingenious screening techniques such as the phage expression or yeast two hybrid systems. These studies, collectively termed \"proteomics\", have greatly enriched our knowledge of cellular physiology and pathology in normal and diseased tissues. A systematic identification of molecular interfaces between interacting proteins in natural cellular environment represents the next major challenge toward a molecular understanding of the complex and dynamic cellular events. Such a profile of molecular interfaces would also be invaluable as a tool in drug development by targeting crucial molecular interfaces. We have initiated such a proteomics project and focusing on the application of chemical cross-linking approach toward a systematic and global identification of protein-protein interfaces in complex systems such as the contractile machinery of muscle cells, the cytoskeletal filaments and organelles of nonmuscle cells. First, high-resolution gel electrophoresis and fractionation techniques are used to identify and index expressed proteins in skeletal and heart muscle tissues. Second, the neighboring relationship is defined by chemical crosslinking with a wide range of reagents. Third, the molecular interfaces of neighboring proteins are identified by isolating the crosslinked complexes, cleaving the proteins and isolating crosslinked peptides for protein sequencing with conventional chemical methods or by mass spectrometry. Fourth, the peptides at the interfaces will be synthesized and their interaction characterized further by capillary electrophoresis and biosensor techniques. A protein sequence database of molecular interfaces of proteins with known and unknown identities will be established to complement and enhance the utility of genome and proteome databases for basic and clinical research. We are evaluating the feasibility and integration potential of each steps of this multifaceted project. In the past year, we have succeeded in applying a fluorogenic crosslinker to facilitate the identification and purification of crosslinked peptides. The interface between a nebulin fragment and calmodulin has been mapped by such a crosslinker and the application of mass spectrometry to identify the peptide sequences that are crosslinked together. Novel folding patterns were also revealed by the intramolecualr crosslinking patterns. We are extending this study to other crosslinkers and more complex protein assemblies in motile systems.',\n",
       " ' Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that can involve almost any organ and can range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Current immunosuppressive regimens have dramatically improved its prognosis but they are not uniformly effective and are associated with significant toxicities. Elucidation of the pathogenesis of lupus is of paramount importance to improve the currently available therapeutic regimens. Production of pathogenic autoantibodies by B lymphocytes and formation of immune complexes are the hallmarks of the disease. Little is known, however about the role of different subsets of B cells and their relation to disease activity. Autoantibody production is antigen driven and depends on activated T cells. Recently it has been recognized that a subset of T cells the so-called regulatory T lymphocytes play an important role in the suppression of ongoing immune activation. It is conceivable that abnormalities in regulatory T cell may contribute to autoimmune diseases. Although the primary event in the initiation of autoimmunity is unknown, by the time SLE is clinically evident there is a self-perpetuating activation of autoreactive B- and T-cells in the lymphoid organs. Once activated, B cells can form memory cells; differentiate into auto-antibody forming plasma cells or plasmablasts; and present auto-antigen to T-cells, inducing proliferation of more activated T cells leading to amplification of this process. Interfering with this process by either blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, or by completely eradicating the abnormal immune system may lead to interruption of the autoimmune response and clinical benefit. Most manifestations of SLE are immune mediated. The mechanism of cognitive dysfunction is much less understood. Understanding the causes of cognitive abnormalities is very important since 30-60% of SLE patients suffer from some degree of cognitive dysfunction and cognitive dysfunction of long duration or with deterioration can have a significant impact on occupational functioning of SLE patients. Recently, it was demonstrated that a subset of anti-DNA antibodies (anti-NR2 antibodies) cross-reacts with the human N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and can cause excitotoxic death of neurons. NMDA receptors are important in memory function and learning, and thus such antibodies may mediate cognitive dysfunction in SLE. Objectives: 1. To evaluate the safety and to collect preliminary data about the efficacy of interleukin-6 blockade in patients with SLE. 2. To assess the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and anti-glutaminergic autoantibodies in SLE 3. To assess the curative potential of intensified immunoablation followed by stem cell transplantation in severe SLE. 4.To analyze B lymphocyte subsets and identify subsets that may be related to changes in disease activity 5. To analyze the function of regulatory T lymphocytes. Results: 1. We conducted a Phase I, dose escalating open label study with an anti-IL6 receptor monoclonal antibody in patients with SLE. Fourteen patients completed the treatment. Preliminary analysis suggests beneficial clinical effects and a profound shift in circulating lymphocyte subpopulations with a decrease in activated memory subsets and an increase in naive subsets. 3. In close collaboration with the NCI, we established a protocol for intensive immunoablation followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in severe lupus using a novel conditioning treatment with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab and address the curative potential of this approach. An important element of the protocol is the broad spectrum of associated laboratory studies addressing the mechanism of the regeneration of the immune system and the role of various subsets of immune cells in tolerance or autoimmunity. During the last year two patients have succesfully udergone the transplant procedure. 4. B cell subsets in SLE. In collaboration with the Autoimmunity Branch, we characterized the abnormal B cell pattern of lupus patients. We identified B cell subsets that are not normally found in the peripheral blood some of which seem to correlate with disease activity. The functional characterization of these cells is in progress. 5. Regulatory T cells: our data indicate that Treg are abnormal in number, phenotype and function in patients with active SLE that could contribute to the pathogenesis of disease flares in these patients. Lay : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is so called autoimmune disease, in which the body turns against itself producing antibodies directed to molecules found in body tissues (antigens). SLE can involve almost any organ and can range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Although current immunosuppressive regimens have dramatically improved its prognosis they are not uniformly effective and are associated with significant toxicities. Antibodies are produced by a certain type of immune cells called B lymphocytes. Although patients with active SLE usually have lower number of B lymphocytes in their blood they are more active then in healthy people. Interfering with this process by either blocking molecules that increase antibody production, such as interleukin-6, or by completely eradicating the abnormal immune system may lead to interruption of the autoimmune response and clinical benefit. We conducted a treatment study blocking interleukin-6 with a man-made antibody for patients with mild-to-moderate lupus and established a study using bone marrow transplant for patients with severe lupus who have failed other treatments. Progress since last year 1. Anti-IL6R monoclonal antibody in SLE. We completed treatment in 14 patients and expect to complete enrollment by October 1, 2005. 2. Intensified immunoablation followed by autologous stem cell transplant: The protocol uses an induction regimen that has not been used in autoimmune diseases previously, has strictly defined inclusion, exclusion and response criteria and addresses the curative potential of this approach by combining the clinical studies with detailed mechanistic studies. We succesfully transplanted two patients 4. We studied the peripheral B lymphocytes of patients with active lupus nephritis and identified several subsets that are not found in the peripheral blood of healthy people, some of which correlate with disease activity. 5. Our data suggest that impaired regulatory T cell function in patients with active lupus. Goals for next year Complete the anti-IL6 receptor monoclonal antibody study and continue enrollment into the autologous stem cell therapy program. Continue to study the correlation between disease activity, B cell phenotypes and other biomarkers. Define regulatory T cell abnormalities further.',\n",
       " 'Our long term goal is to understand how contractile machinery of muscle cells assembles during development, how it dissembles during remodeling of muscle tissues, how external force and extracellular matrices affect gene expression and muscle structure and function, how the force is transmitted via the Z bands of the sarcomere, and how muscles malfunction in nemaline myopathy and other muscle diseases. The cytoplasm of striated muscle cells contains, besides actin and myosin filaments, contains at least two interconnected lattices. An intermediate filament lattice envelops and links all sarcomeres to the membrane skeleton, mitochondria, nuclei, and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Inside the sarcomere, a cytoskeletal matrix consisted of a set of elastic titin filaments and a set of inextensible nebulin filaments provides structural continuity. Both lattices generate restoring force. Active force and elastic force are transmitted through specialized anchor structures of the sarcomere. 1: Structure and function of the Z bands: One important stress-bearing structure is the Z line, a dense and narrow structure that anchors and organizes four major filaments: actin, titin, nebulin and desmin filaments. The Z lines play important roles in the structural organization of sarcomere, the transmission of mechanical forces as well as the stress signaling pathways. We are addressing the following questions: 1. what are the roles of titin, nebulin (skeletal muscles), nebulette (a nebulin-like protein in the heart) in the assembly and integrity of the Z line in vertebrate muscle 2. What are the composition and structure of the unusually broad Z line of sonic muscle of Midshipman fish 3. What are the roles of protein kinases, nonmuscle myosin and other signaling proteins in the function of the Z lines 4. What is its relationship to the anomalous nemaline rod Z bodies found in aging heart muscle, in diseased skeletal muscle known as nemaline myopathy (2) The roles of Xin family of proteins: In our search for binding partners of nebulin by yeast two-hybrid, we discovered that nebulin-SH3 binds to a large proline-rich region of human and mouse Xin protein, an adherens junction protein required for cardiac morphogenesis and looping (Wang, et al, 1999, Sinn, et al, 2002). Further characterization of this binding partner indicated that it was a heretofore unknown member of the Xin family that consists of two genes: aXin (first described by Jim Lin at Iowa) and bXin. Both aXin and bXin proteins have similar domain organization with an N-terminal repeat domain and a proline-rich domain. We are investigating the function of bXin in human and mouse. The human bXin (Chr. 2, 371 kb, 15 kb of 15 exons) and mouse bXin (Chr. 2, 330 kb, 12 kb of 13 exons) are expressed as complex, alternatively-spliced transcripts (7 for human bXin; 5 for mouse bXin). One major product of the bXin gene is the bXin protein consisting of 3000 residues, with 94% being encoded by one long exon. Other alternatively-spliced variants exclude this exon and incorporate a LIM domain. Exon 7 and 13 of human bXin gene and exon 5 and 11 of mouse bXin gene are muscle-specific. The expression of bXin proteins is high in skeletal muscle and heart and low in lung and testis. bXin protein expression increases after differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts and after birth in mouse skeletal and heart muscle. In cultured mouse embryonic cardiomyocytes, bXin is localized at the stress fibers connecting myofibrils to focal adhesion and non-striated region along myofibrils. bXin appears to be important in the myosin isoform switching from nonmuscle myosin to sarcomeric myosin during myofibrillogenesis. Loss of bXin transcript and protein, by siRNA knock down technique, resulted in aberrant formation of myofibrils and caused the formation of extensive membrane protrusions. (3): Muscle assembly and disassemmbly in muscle cells subjected to external force: Since muscle cells both generate force internally and respond to force externally, we are investigating the cellular responses of muscle cells mechanical stress and how they alter their gene expression and programs of assembly and disassembly. The distribution of titin, nebulin, nebulette, Xin proteins and nonmuscle myosin IIA and IIB and into the myofibrils and the Z lines are being studied with siRNA knock down techniques and fluorescence localization techniques in live cells in culture. The muscle cells are subjected to cyclic strains on elastic substrate of defined stiffness. (4): The role of nebulin in nemaline myopathy animal model: We are collaborating with Dr. Ju Chen at UCSD to characterize the muscle on the further characterization of striated muscles in the nebulin knock out mice that they generated. We are determining determined the thin filament length distribution in skeletal muscles by electron and immunoelectron microscopy to assess the distribution of actin tropomyosin troponin, capping proteins such as tropomodulin, myopallidin and CapZ along the thin filaments as well as the glycogen granule proteins. We also plan to study the calcium activation of contraction of these muscles subjected to cyclic mechanical activity in vivo and as isolated muscle fibers to evaluate their extent of mechanical damage and their force pCa and force ATPase curves. Additionally, the rate of formation of nemaline rods will be monitored to assess the effect of external force on the nemaline rod formation. We aim to understand the molecular basis of the formation of nemaline rods and whether the formation of inclusion bodies in muscle diseases such as nemaline myopathy is a coping mechanism to deal with weakened sarcomeres or force transmission.',\n",
       " 'Background During the last several years our laboratory has studied five different dominantly-inherited autoinflammatory disorders. The first of these illnesses is the TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), which is characterized by oftentimes prolonged attacks of fever, serositis, migratory rash and myalgia, arthritis, periorbital edema, conjunctivitis, and, in some patients, systemic amyloidosis. In 1999 our group identified the first six mutations in the gene encoding the 55 kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFRSF1A) in seven families with dominantly-inherited recurrent fevers, and therefore proposed the name TRAPS for this clinical condition. Initial mechanistic studies indicated a defect in the activation-induced shedding of the p55 (but not p75) TNF receptor, possibly leading to impaired homeostasis of the immune response. In 2002 we and a French group independently discovered dominantly-inherited de novo mutations in a second gene, CIAS1 (also known as NALP3 or PYPAF1), in about 50% of patients with a disorder known as neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) or chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome. Manifestations of NOMID CINCA may include daily fevers, an urticaria-like skin rash, chronic aseptic meningitis, uveitis, papilledema, sensorineural hearing loss, mental retardation, patellar and epiphyseal long bone overgrowth, and systemic amyloidosis. Two phenotypically milder conditions, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), are caused by mutations in the same gene. CIAS1 encodes a protein, cryopyrin, that participates in a macromolecular complex called the inflammasome to regulate the activation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta. A fifth dominantly-inherited autoinflammatory disorder, denoted the syndrome of pyogenic arthritis with pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA), is caused by mutations in a protein known as proline serine threonine phosphatase interacting protein (PSTPIP1). PAPA is characterized by episodes of mono- or pauciarticular sterile pyogenic arthritis, which can be destructive if not treated, formation of open, purulent ulcers of the skin (pyoderma gangrenosum), and severe cystic acne. In 2003 our group discovered that PSTPIP1 binds pyrin, the protein mutated in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), and that disease-associated mutations in PSTPIP1 lead to more avid binding to pyrin, and increased IL-1 beta activation, relative to healthy controls. Results of the Last Year Functional studies of mutant TNFRSF1A molecules: In collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Richard Siegel, we have continued analyses of the functional consequences of TRAPS-associated TNFRSF1A mutations. Studies performed during previous reporting periods have demonstrated that the aforementioned defect in TNFR ectodomain cleavage is unlikely to explain all or most of the autoinflammatory phenotype in this disorder, and in transfection systems the mutant receptors have been found to exhibit diminished binding to TNF and abnormal intracellular trafficking, with retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A number of studies during the present reporting period have focused on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from TRAPS patients and controls. We found that although TNFRSF1A mRNA levels are similar between patients and controls, the amount of protein in whole cell lysates is significantly higher. Cycloheximide studies indicate a prolonged TNFRSF1A protein half-life in TRAPS, consistent with the finding of ER retention in cell lines. We also found increased phosphorylated JNK in unstimulated TRAPS PBMCs. To probe the sensitivity of TRAPS PBMCs to stimulation, we studied cytokine secretion. PBMCs from 13 TRAPS patients without fever and 13 controls were incubated for 24 hours with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokine concentrations were measured in supernatants. TRAPS PBMCs did not show spontaneous secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8. However, at low concentrations of LPS, TRAPS PBMCs secreted significantly more IL-1beta, TNF, and IL-6 than control PBMCs. This increased cytokine response was especially prominent in TRAPS patients with normal serum C-reactive protein levels at the time of phlebotomy. Gene expression profiling in NOMID: In 16 of 18 patients with NOMID who were treated with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, we performed gene expression profiling of mRNA from PBMCs with Affymetrix U133A 2.0 microarrays, and selected transcripts were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Among the validated genes were a number with known immunologic function, including STAT1, SOCS3, MMP9, SOD2, IFNGR1, and BCL6. We also found several genes that are downregulated by anakinra that do not have a well-characterized role in inflammation. One such gene is SNCA, encoding alpha-synuclein, the protein product of which is mutated in some forms of familial Parkinsons disease, and which we have found to be expressed in human monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphcytes from healthy controls. Studies of IL-1 inhibition in the cryopyrinopathies: In collaboration with Dr. Raphaela Goldbach-Mansky, we continue therapeutic trials of anakinra and a longer-acting IL-1 inhibitor manufactured by Regeneron pharmaceuticals and denoted IL-1 Trap. These studies are more thoroughly presented under project Z01 AR041138-05 OCD. Generation of new animal models: We are currently in the process of developing new animal models for the cryopyrinopathies and PAPA syndrome. In collaboration with Dr. Hal Hoffman, we are developing models for FCAS (CIAS1 L3533P), MWS (A352V), and NOMID (D303N, Y570C). We are also generating PSTPIP1 knockout mice, and the PSTPIP1 E250Q PAPA knockin mouse. Development of a resequencing chip for mutational screening of undiagnosed patients: With Affymetrix, we have developed a resequencing chip to interrogate approximately 300 kb of genomic sequence in patients with currently genetically uncharacterized periodic fevers. There are 91 genes represented on the chip, including those known to cause autoinflammatory disease, genes encoding inflammasome components, cytokine and cytokine receptor genes, and genes encoding NF-kappa B components, various signaling molecules, myeloid proteins, and regulators of apoptosis. Conclusions and Significance Studies on the functional consequences of TNFRSF1A mutations suggest a more complex pathophysiologic model of TRAPS than previously appreciated, in which constitutive cellular activation may play a prominent role. Studies of patients undergoing treatment for NOMID are likely to reveal new inflammatory genes and regulators. During the next year we plan to continue collaborative studies of TNF receptor cell biology and NOMID treatment, to begin screening patients with undiagnosed autoinflammatory diseases with our newly developed resequencing chip, and to begin phenotypic studies on CIAS1 and PSTPIP1 mice as appropriate backcross lines are bred.',\n",
       " 'Stratification of the epidermis commences during embryonic development and is a process that continues to occur throughout the life of the organism. The process entails the outward movement of the proliferative basal cells that are adjacent to the basement membrane toward the surface of the skin. The stratification is concurrent with a Ca++-dependent differentiation process and the layer-specific expression of structural and enzymatic markers, with the basal proliferative cell differentiating first to a spinous cell, then to a granular cell, to ultimately terminally differentiate as a cornified, anucleated cell. To elucidate the functional role of the Dlx3 homeodomain protein during early development and during epidermal differentiation, we are currently in the process of determining the target genes and the Dlx3 interacting factors necessary to exert the transcription regulatory function. Furthermore, biochemical characterization of a mutant form of Dlx3 that in humans is associated with the autosomal dominant Tricho-Dento-Osseous (TDO) syndrome is also being performed. TDO syndrome is characterized by defects in ectodermal derivatives such as hair and teeth and craniofacial bone abnormalities. Recent findings show that Dlx3 is also expressed in the developing bone, and the expression is retained in trabecular bone of the adult skeleton. Identification and characterization of a novel epidermal- and differentiation-specific gene. Performing a Suppressive Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) screen we obtained a cDNA clone we termed Scarf, which has homology to Calmodulin-like proteins. The ORF encodes a protein that contains four conserved EF-hand motifs, putative Ca++-binding domains. The Ca++ signaling dependent systems, such as keratinocyte differentiation process, must be finely tuned for rapid and effective response to transient variations in Ca++ concentration. A central role in the transduction of Ca++ signals is played by members of the Ca++-binding proteins. The functionality of the EF-hand motifs may contribute to specificity in the interaction with the target molecules. Thus, it is through the binding of Ca++ by the EF-motifs that these proteins are able to bind or liberate target interacting proteins and in this way modulate their functions. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis showed restricted differential expression of the Scarf gene in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis. Furthermore, induction of Scarf expression was observed upon in vitro differentiation by Ca++ of primary cultured keratinocytes. The functionality of Scarf EF-hand domains was assayed with a radioactive Ca++-binding method, determining that Scarf EF-hand motifs are functional binding domains. To identify Scarf target proteins we are performing immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry. Identification of target proteins will aid in understanding the role of Scarf during keratinocyte differentiation.',\n",
       " 'MyoD belongs to a family of transcription factors - the myogenic bHLH- which is required for the formation of skeletal muscle in the animal. The transcriptional activity of MyoD is regulated at the DNA-binding level, by post-translational modifications, and by interaction with several regulatory proteins. Among the latter, acetyltransferases and deacetylases promote and inhibit the activity of MyoD, respectively, through acetylation deacetylation of histones and of MyoD itself. Recently, we have shown that acetylation of MyoD not only increases its affinity for DNA but also induces a conformational change in its structure. We speculate that such conformational change may affect the ability of MyoD to interact with protein partners. To isolate proteins interacting with MyoD we have developed a bicistronic retroviral system to deliver MyoD to cells growing is suspension. We have generated cells stably expressing a double-tagged recombinant MyoD (FLAG and HA sequence tags). Large quantities of cells were grown and protein purification performed by affinity chromatography using FLAG-immobilized agarose beads. The MyoD-associated factors (MAFs) were resolved on SDS-PAGE and the corresponding polypeptides were identified by mass spectrometry.We are currently testing the functional relevance of some of the MAFs. These experiments should help elucidating the molecules and mechanisms employed to achieve cell-type specific gene expression in skeletal muscle. ',\n",
       " 'MyoD is a transcriptional activator required for muscle-specific gene expression. Expression of exogenous MyoD in numerous terminally differentiated cell lineages ( neurons, adipocytes, skin cells, chondrocytes adn others) redirect their fates towards the skeletal muscle phenotype. Furthermore, MyoD - and the related Myf-5 protein- is essential for the formation of skeletal muscles in the animal. In order to activate transcription, MyoD requires the assistance of other interacting partners such as the p300 CBP and PCAf coactivators. We have previously reported that p300 and PCAF are nodal coactivators of the muscle specific transcription factor MyoD. MyoD is acetylated by PCAF and this results in an increased DNA-binding and transcriptional activity. Acetylation and deacetylation are in a dynamic equilibrium and our studies have identified a role for the histone deacetylases (HDACs) in controlling muscle differentiation. To uncover the molecular mechanisms and the effectors that mediate the HDACs activity, we have used small molecules to inhibit the enzymatic activity of HDACs in skeletal muscle cells and performed microarray temporal profiling. Furthermore, prompted by the observation that the redox state fluctuates in skeletal muscle in response to modification of oxygen tension and glucose uptake, we have analyzed the role of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase Sir2 in controlling muscle gene expression.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT 1) The CDR3, which conveys the antigen specificity of the B cell, is the most variable region of Ig due to hypermutation and extensive molecular processing in the junctions during recombination. The development by our laboratory of a web based software analysis program (JoinSolver) has provided a tool to perform high throughput quantitative and qualitative analysis of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to CDR3 specificity and diversity. This year JoinSolver software improvements include the analysis of heavy chain mutations that occur in the CDR3, mutations that occur in overlapping motifs and comparative regional mutation analysis for Framework Regions (FR)1, 2 and 3 and Complementarity Determining Regions (CDR)1, 2 and 3. Recently a Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine the frequency at which random mutation occurs in the CDR3. Future plans include analysis of complex mutation patterns that develop from insertions and deletions and the adaptation of the same analyses to light chains. PROJECT 2) Repertoire and mutation analysis of individual B cells from patients with genetic defects in proteins that regulate B cell development and function. The individual analyses allow us to isolate the contribution of single elements of the multi-component regulation of somatic hypermutation (SHM), class switching, selection, and plasma cell vs memory cell development. To perform these studies we amplify and sequence genomic heavy and light chain gene rearrangements in individual B cells. The technique allows us to analyze molecular mechanisms that are revealed in nonproductive rearrangements as well as the impact of selection that is imposed on productive rearrangements. The following defective signaling elements that influence developmental pathways, response thresholds and germinal center reactions are under investigation: (1) Molecules that regulate germinal center reactions which are required for B cell memory development, such as (a) CD40 ligand mutation (X-HIgM) and (b) CD40 deficiency; (2) deficiency in AID (Activation induced cytidine deaminase), the master regulator of hypermutation; (3) Mutated Fas which regulates B cell homeostasis through activation induced cell death (ALPS--Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome); and (4) Xeroderma Pigmentosa Variant (XPV) defect in the DNA polymerase eta which is an error-prone polymerase believed to contribute to SHM. We found that CD40 ligand deficiency results in an abnormally skewed repertoire enriched with B cells using VH4 rearrangements that have a propensity for autoreactivity. Whereas the role of AID-induced G C mutations are well understood, the mechanism by which A T mutations occur was not known. (1) Analysis of X-HIgM mutations has revealed how the SHM develops in normal B cells:(a) in X-HIgM the hypermutable C in WRCY (R=A G, Y=C T, W=A T) was mutated whereas the complementary G in RGYW was not mutated, (b) WA motif mutations overlap RGYW motifs, but not WRCY motifs, in which the U:G mismatch has undergone repair, and (c) transitions abnormally outnumber transversions. We concluded that the A T mutation spectrum is linked to AID-targeted G C mutations via repair and repair involving POL eta activity occurs preferentially on the non-transcribed strand. (2) Other studies revealed that the Fas mutation results in over-utilization of VH4 genes, failure to develop CD27+ memory B cells and increased survival of B cells with mutations that jeopardize stable Ig structure. (3) Studies of the AID deficient B cells revealed that: (a) mutations occur at a frequency that significantly exceeds that of non-B cells suggesting that DNA repair mechanisms are down-regulated in germinal center B cells, (b) AID targeted mutation in RGYW WRCY motifs and POL eta mutational targeting in WA motifs were lost. No new mutational targeting motif was identified. (c) replacement substitutions were reduced in the CDRs, and d) transitions occurred more frequently than in normal B cells. These data led to the conclusions that in the absence of AID, mutations occur 20-fold less frequently than normal B cells and the mutations that do occur are associated with AID-independent cytidine deamination that is an inefficient mechanism for influencing the antigen binding site. Furthermore, the data suggest AID is required to recruit or increase the accessibility of POL eta and UNG. PROJECT 3) Pseudo-hybrid formations in heavy chain variable segments as a mechanism of receptor editing. Receptor editing revision is a mechanism that B cells can use to avoid autoreactivity. One form of editing that is uniquely associated with VH4 family genes involves the invasion of an upstream VH4 gene into the FR3 region of a previously rearranged VH4 gene. In contrast to other reports, our in vitro data demonstrates the mechanism involved may infrequently depend on recombination activation genes (RAG). Further studies will explore the role of AID-dependent strand breaks in the formation of hybrid joins. PROJECT 4) Repertoire and mutation analysis of anergic CD19lowIgD+ cells in SLE patients. Anergy is a mechanism by which self-reactive B cells may become unresponsive; thus, CD19lowIgD+ cells were analyzed to determine whether this population was oliogoclonal or otherwise enriched with autoreactive B cells. We found the CD19lowIgD+ cells were polyclonal and used many of the same genes utilized by the CD19highIgD+ cells isolated from the same SLE patient. However, a greater representation of B cells expressing VH4 genes were included in the CD19lowIgD+ subset. We concluded that in SLE this form of anergy may be used to generally downregulate B cell hyperactivity, as well as to regulate the activity of specific VH4 B cells. PROJECT 5) Characterization of Circulating Human CD5+ B cells. The goals of this project include the functional and phenotypic characterization of circulating human CD5+ B cells and discernment of the role of CD5+ B cell subsets in systemic autoimmune disease (SLE). Based on previous studies, CD5+ B cells have been shown to play an important role in autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases. However, most of the data on human CD5+ B cells have been obscured by the heterogeneous characteristics of CD5+ B cells that need to be further characterized. Preliminary data suggests that the CDR5+ subsets from normal donors are functionally & phenotypically distinct populations. Other ongoing projects: 1. The development of murine B cells expressing rearranged human Ig receptors in a transgenic model 2. Repertoire and mutation analysis of peripheral blood B cells containing a CD40 snp',\n",
       " 'The signals regulating human B cell function have not been thoroughly explored. The B Cell Biology Group (BCBG) has focused on the mechanisms by which signals delivered through the B cell surface molecule, CD40, regulate human B cell function. Specifically, the research of the BCBG investigates the role of interactions between CD154 CD40L TNFSF5 and CD40 TNFRSF5 as well as other TNF superfamily member receptor-ligand pairs in the activation and differentiation of human B cells to memory cells and plasma cells. Signals delivered through CD154-CD40 interactions regulate essential B cell maturational events such as germinal center formation, immunoglobulin heavy chain class switching, somatic hypermutation and differentiation to memory cells or plasma cells, but the exact details of the signaling cascades involved have not been delineated. The goal of the research of the B Cell Biology Group is to determine signaling events that occur during a normal humoral immune response so that one can understand defects in these pathways that occur in immunodeficiencies such as HyperIgM syndrome and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Work within the B Cell Biology Group investigates signaling in five component steps: 1) receptor engagement; 2) recruitment of adaptor molecules; 3) proximal kinase activation; 4) transcription factor stimulation; and ultimately, 5) production of a functional outcome. Mechanisms connecting cell surface occupancy with downstream signaling events, specific gene transcription and functional outcomes are examined following engagement of TNF superfamily members on B cells with recombinant ligands. Signaling cascades are dissected using novel biochemical and multi-parameter flow cytometric assays following transfection or transduction of B cells with constructs expressing constitutively active or dominant negative proteins. Gene expression is examined by microarray and confirmed by quantitative PCR, Western blotting, the proteomic technique Immunoaffinity Capillary Electrophoresis (ICE) and flow cytometry. Functional outcomes are examined in vitro, ex vivo immediately following isolation of human blood or tonsillar tissue samples, and following transplantation of activated human secondary lymphoid tissue and primary lymphocyte populations into the RAG KO NOD Perforin KO mouse model. Despite the complexity, specific checkpoints within the cascades regulate signaling and provide evidence of novel means to regulate B cell function therapeutically. In summary, the results of the experiments of the B Cell Biology Group have delineated the role of CD40 signaling in abnormal germinal center reactions in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus that lead differentiation of autoimmune plasma cell and memory B cell populations. Moreover, a novel fluorescence resonance transfer (FRET) technique has been developed to examine CD40-induced signaling events by multi-parameter flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Further delineation of the signaling cascades and the genes expressed following engagement of CD40 on the surface of human B cells should provide unique targets that could be exploited to regulate B cell activity.',\n",
       " '1). Background leading to the current reporting period a). We have established the techniques to produce and identify the ethyl acetate (EA) extract of Chinese herbal medicine, Tripterygium wilfordii hook F TwHF for clinical trials and obtained and identified the usefulness of large quantity of the TwHF materials for further clinical trials. We have shown the benefit of the EA extract of (TwHF), to the patients with rheumatoid arthritis by a double blind trial; b). In 2004, we have started the preclinical trail of the EA extract of TwHF on NZB WF1 mice, the human SLE model. We have found that most animals developed varying degrees of kidney disease at 25 week of age. Therefore, the animals were treated from the age of 25 weeks with the EA extract at the doses equivalent to 1 20 or 1 10 of the LD50 or vehicle only. c). From the pharmacokinetic study on the EA extract and its active component, triptolide, in rats, we have found that most of the administered triptolide was eliminated as a single peak that processes similar HPLC pattern and bioactivities to another active diterpenoid of TwHF, tripdiolide. Therefore, we separated and purified the metabolites from urine obtained from the rats treated with triptolide. Three metabolite components were separated from the urine, two (Metabolite A and B) of the three showned suppressive activity on cell proliferation and production of IL-1, IL-2 and TNF by human peripheral mononuclear cells. Metabolite A also inhibits mitogen stimulated NFkB and AP-1 transcription by jurkat cells. These studies delineated the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory and immunossupressive action of the extract of TwHF and its active components that is relevant to inhibited transcriptional activation of NFkB, AP-1 and NFAT; d). Though, preclinical and clinical trials have been conducted, the toxicology of the EA extract or its active components has never been examined. 2). Objectives of the current work: a). Support the phaseII III clinical trial on RA conducted at the Clinical Center of NIH; b). complete the preclinical trial of the EA extract on glomerulonephritis developed in NZB W F1 mice. Further explore the therapeutic efficacy of triptolide and tripdiolide, the active components of the EA extract, on lupus nephritis in NZB W F1 mice. c). examine and identify the chemical structures of the metabolites of triptolide d). Examine the sub-chronic and chronic toxic effects of triptolide, the major active component of the EA extract; and e). further elucidate the mechanism by which the EA extract and its active components exert their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory action. 3). Results: a). There have been 116 patients enrolled in the clinical trail of the EA extract of TwHF on RA conducted by clinical stuff of NIAMS. An interim analysis has been done showing significant differences between groups in disease improvement. There has been no severe adverse effect observed in treated patients. b). The preclinical trial of the EA extract on NZB W F1 mice has been completed. Methods for determination of serum anti-DNA antibody titers, glomerular deposition of IgG and complement lymphocyte subpopulation in kidneys and spleens by immunohistochemical staining, lymphocyte subpopulations by flow cytometry were established. Results from the studies show that at 28 weeks of age, proteinuria (> 30mg dL) and anti-ds-DNA antibody were found in all mice of the 3 groups. Fourteen, 16 and 15 mice in the vehicle, EAlow and EAhigh group, respectively, completed at least 4 weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, the mean proteinuria of the EAlow and EAhigh groups was significantly less than that of the vehicle group and no different than proteinuria at the onset of treatment. Histological evidence of glomerulonephritis, glomerular deposition of IgG and complement and cellular infiltration in the interstitium and perivascular regions were significantly less severe in the EA extract- treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice. Treatment had no significant effect on the levels of anti-dsDNA antibody. The conclusion is that treatment with the EA extract significantly inhibited the progression of kidney disease in NZB W F1 mice. A paper has been completed and submitted to !Arthritis & Rheumatism! for publication. To further examine whether the active components, triptolide and tripdiolide, also exert similar effect as the EA extract on lupus nephritis, we have conducted a preclinical trial where the NZB W F1 mice, 17 in each group, were treated with vehicle only or triptolide or tripdiolide for 16 weeks at a dose equivalent to 1 7 of the dose that caused death in 50% of treated mice. At the end of study, the incidence of severe kidney disease evidenced by excessive proteinuria and significantly elevated BUN were 88%, 29% and 29% for the groups treated with vehicle only, triptolide and tripdiolide, respectively. During the treatment course, 12, 3 and 2 mice were dead in the groups treated with vehicle only, triptolide and tripdiolide, respectively. These primary data confirmed what we have found in our previous in vitro and in clinical studies that triptolide and tripdiolide are the two major components responsible for most of the immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effect of the EA extract. Histological and immunopathologic studies are currently being performed for further evaluation of the results of the trial. c). Because of the extremely low content of the metabolites of triptolide in the urine, we have had to separate and purify the metabolites from multiple groups of rats to obtain enough of these compounds for structural identification. So far, we have purified three unknown compounds A( about 250 Yg ),B ( about 40 Yg ), and C( about 150 Yg ), from the urine. We have identified their molecular weight by MS. Based on the MW and HPLC pattern, metabolite A, most likely, is tripdiolide. We have sent metabolite A, B and C to Dr. Kirk Gustafson of NCI for confirmation of their chemical structure by cellular NMR. Results are pending. d). The toxicity studies were designed to have 4 groups of rats. Each group includes 8 rats for triptolide treatment and 4 for control. Triptolide was administered orally 5 days a week for 16 weeks at 1 7 of the dose that caused death in 50% of treated rats. The rats were sacrificed 0, 3, 9 and 12 months, respectively, after completion of the treatment course. Up to now, we have completed 3 groups for the studies. The last group that is going to be observed for 3 months is currently under treatment course. There was no significant difference in bodyweight between the treated or the control animals at the end of treatment course. Organs from all animals of the 3 groups have been sent to Histoserv and detailed histological findings are pending. e). In terms of the mechanism by which triptolide exerts its immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory action, we have found that triptolide inhibited expression of reporter gene driven by varying promoters, including NFkB, AP-1, NFAT, iNOs as well as COX 2. Previous results from binding tests using multiple methods show that triptolide could not compete with Dex to bind the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) either in a whole cell or in GR-labeled particles. However, recently, we have further confirmed that triptolide strongly inhibited mitogen stimulated reporter gene expression driven by p-MMTV promoter that was greatly enhanced by dexamethasone (Dex). This inhibition was in a concentration-dependent manner suggesting that triptolide interfered with the complex of Dex and its receptor (GR) to bind to the DNA element for glucocorticoid receptor (GRE) activation.',\n",
       " '1) A number of inflammatory arthritic conditions present in adults and children and can be associated with significant long term disability. In adults, rheumatoid arthritis (RA)a chronic, autoimmune mediated, inflammatory arthritis that occurs in approximately 0.5-1% of the general population, affects women 2.5 time more commonly than men. Patients with RA present with an additive symmetric polyarthritis, typically involving the wrists, and small hand joints. Synovial inflammation and bone erosion are the hallmark of this disease and lead to joint destruction, irreversible joint deformities and disability. The etiology and pathogenesis of this disease is not well understood and reliable diagnostic and prognostic factors are often insufficient to predict the outcome early in the course of the disease. In children, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is the most common childhood rheumatic disease and ranges from 9.2 to 13.9 per 100,000 children. The disease can be divided clinically into 3 different subsets depending on disease presentation: 1. pauciarticular, involving < 4 joints at presentation, 2. polyarticular involving >4 joints and 3. systemic JRA, presenting with systemic features such as fever, evanescent rash, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepato splenomegaly or serositis. Persistent synovial inflammation in the joint can lead to joint destruction, growth abnormalities, early disability and premature mortality. Once thought to be a disease of children that remits, it is now known that between 50-60% of patients continue to have persistent arthritis into adulthood. Disabilities are more common than previously expected. This research in adults with RA and children with JIA is designed to understand clinical aspects and the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, in the context of interventions targeting specific inflammatory cytokines. Understanding pathogenic mechanisms in clinical responders and non-responders to anti-cytokine therapy may allow us to subset patient populations based on individual differences in immune regulation and eventually guide us towards a rational approach of designing individualized treatment regimens. I have focused my studies on investigating a number of clinical, imaging and laboratory measures that should allow us to evaluate the impact of an anti-TNF intervention on the immunopathogenic mechanisms in adults with RA and children with JRA. Several clinical treatment protocols were initiated to explore a number of clinical questions: 2) OBJECTIVE OF PRESENT STUDIES a. To evaluate the use of MRI and CT as sensitive imaging modalities to address questions concerning the pathophysiology of bone destruction and remodeling b. To evaluate the impact of anti-TNF therapy on immunopathogenic mechanisms c. To evaluate endocrine and metabolic responses to targeted interventions. d. To evaluate the clinical benefit of a Chinese root extract (Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis I. Active Treatment Protocols: a. MRI imaging trial using infliximab in patients with active erosive rheumatoid arthritis. This study explores two imaging modalities of bone, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computertomography (CT) of the wrist in following bone destruction on and off anti TNF therapy. b. Evaluation of the function of regulatory T cells in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis before and after treatment with the TNF inhibitor Infliximab. Regulatory T cell function is compromised in a number of patients with inflammatory conditions. In collaboration with Dr Xavier Valencia we are addressing the question if regulatory T cell function can be restored by blocking TNF in patients with active RA before and after treatment with infliximab. c. In this study we examine if effective treatment with infliximab in children with treatment refractory JIA will improve their GH secretion and growth. d. This study evaluates the growth hormone axis in premenopausal woman with active RA. This study is conducted in collaboration with the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) e. Evaluation of the clinical benefit of the Chinese root extract (Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F) in patients with active RA. Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) is a traditional medicinal plant that has been used in China for many years to treat inflammatory conditions including RA. This study tests if TwHF is superior to Sulfasalazine in improving the signs and symptoms in subjects with RA. 3) RESULTS DURING THE PAST YEAR AND ONGOING INITIATIVES The following results have come from the ongoing studies: a. Recruitment for the MRI and JIA studies has been discontinued. We continue to use MRI and CT to visualize bony abnormalities of the wrist in patients with early RA. Jeff Duryea developed a semi-automated segmentation tool to outline carpal bones on the CT images. We validated this method using a phantom hand model and are now int he process to determine the size of lesion changes that can be captured with this method. in addition a software was generated to overlay consecutive images and determine the volume and areas of change. b. We recruited 12 patients and have evidence that regulatory T cell function is abnormal in patients with active RA that can be corrected by treating patients with the TNF inhibitor infliximab. c. Recruitment into the JRA study has been discontinued. We can document definite benefit from treatment with infliximab however the sample size is too small and heterogeneous to determine GH secretion chnages with tretment with infliximab. Ananlysis of the bone mineral densitiy evalution is still ongoing d. Eight patients with RA and 10 healthy age and BMI matched control subjects have been enrolled into the GH study. An interim analysis showed a significnat difference in GH secretion, diminished IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels in women with RA compared to healthy age and body mass index matched controls. d. The TwHF protocol completed recruitment of 121 subjects. An interim analysis was conducted and showed a significant difference in ACR 20 responses between the two treatment arms indicating that our assumptions regarding differences in treatment effects that found the basis for the power calculations were correct. 4) CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE a. Rheumatoid arthritis and JRA are chronic inflammatory diseases. However the effects of new exiting treatments targeting the inflammatory cytokine, TNF- alpha, on alleviating signs and symptoms of the disease as well as retarding bone damage have recently been established in large multi-center trials. Our studies will help to define the impact of anti-TNF blockade on bone destruction and remodeling using very sensitive imaging modalities such as MRI and CT. b. Regulatory T cells downregulate immune responses and may be important in regulating disease activity in patients with RA. This research is aimed to understand the role and impact of regulatory T cell function in RA patients. c and d. Patients with RA or JRA develop metabolic changes early during their course of disease including loss of bone mineral density (osteopenia), loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia) and an increased cardio-vascular risk. The studies evaluating the immune-endocrine function may help us to understand whether inflammation induced changes in GH secretion can mediate metabolic changes such as osteopenia, sarcopenia and are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. e. Evaluation of TwHF will allow us to assess a novel drug with mechanisms blocking inflammation that are different from TNF blockade. This drug may be an important adjunct in the treatment armamentarium of drugs to treat inflammation and prevent disease progression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.',\n",
       " 'Numerous lines of evidence have shown that diets rich in Numerous lines of evidence have shown that diets rich in fruits and vegetables prevent or slow various types of cancers, including breast, prostate, and kidney cancers. However, the plant constituents (phytochemicals) responsible for this, and their mechanisms of action, remain to be elucidated. In this, the major project of the Section, we have examined the effect of a number of phytochemicals on various biochemical mechanisms relevant to carcinogenesis. The phytochemicals studied include the flavonoids, which are present in all fruits and vegetables. These include diosmin, from citrus fruit, quercetin, the most abundant flavonoid which is present in all dietary plants, and galangin and kaempferol, metabolites of quercetin. Other phytochemicals include the b-diketones curcumin and dibenzoylmethane, and resveratrol, a phytoalexin present in grape skins and therefore in grape juice and wine. All of these compounds have been shown to be chemopreventive in animal models of cancer, and epidemiologic studies have shown that food items containing large amounts of these compounds are associated with a reduced risk of cancer. There are many biochemical and molecular events associated with the development of cancer. One of the most important pathways is mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). The AhR is a cytoplasmic transcription factor which, upon ligand binding, translocates to the nucleus, where, with its protein partner ARNT, it interacts with the xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) present in the promoter region of a number of genes. The best characterized molecular response to ligands of the AhR is the induction of expression of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1). CYP1A1 is a Phase 1 metabolic enzyme which activates environmental procarcinogens to their ultimate genotoxic forms. In addition to CYP1A1, the AhR controls a number of other genes, termed the \"AhR battery\", which affect both the activation and detoxification of carcinogens. We have concentrated on the Phase 1, or activating, enzymes, including CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and CYP1A2. We have also examined the effect phytochemicals on quinone reductase, a Phase 2, or detoxifying, enzyme, that is part of the AhR battery. In carrying out this research, we have done both in vitro experimentation in a variety of cell lines, as well as in vivo experimentation in rodents. We have examined how certain phytochemicals affect the activity of the AhR, including its ability to bind carcinogenic ligands and to interact with the XRE. We have examined the transcriptional activation of CYP1A1 and determined the effect of chemopreventive compounds on the expression and enzymatic activity of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and CYP1A2. We have studied a number of environmental carcinogens which bind to the AhR, such as benzoapyrene (BP), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) that is a potent environmental carcinogen present in cooked meat, cigarettes, and as by-products of industrial waste. We have also examined 2,3,5,7-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin(TCDD), a member of the dioxin family of potent carcinogens and the prototypical AhR ligand. We have found that many dietary phytochemicals modulate the cellular response to environmental carcinogens by affecting the AhR. For example, we demonstrated that resveratrol inhibits both the activity and expression of CYP1A1 that is normally induced by carcinogens such as TCDD or BP. It does this by blocking the binding of the ligand-activated AhR with the XRE of the CYP1A1 promoter, preventing the up-regulation of transcription. In addition, it directly inhibits enzymatic activity by a competitive mechanism. Thus, this dual mechanism of inhibiting the major carcinogen activating enzyme in most tissues provides a biochemical mechanism for its proven chemopreventive effect. We have also found that AhR activity is modulated by curcumin, dibenzoylmethane, quercetin, diosmin, and a number of other phytochemicals. We are currently investigating the effect of these compounds on other mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis, including the modulation of expression of g-glutamyltranspeptidase and telomerase. In order to identify further molecular targets of phytochemicals, we are also utilizing microarray technology. We have also examined the effects of other chemopreventive compounds which are not phytochemicals, on the AhR. These include the steroid hormone dehydroepiandrosterone and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatant drug, sulindac.',\n",
       " 'Modulation of cellular signaling and genetic regulation by imidopeptides, amino acids and their metabolites were studied at the level of: a) Imidodipeptides and prolidase, b) Pyrroline 5-carboxylate (P5C) as a signaling and regulatory molecule and c) Enzymes mediating the formation and degradation of P5C. a. Imidodipeptides and prolidase. Imidodipeptides containing proline or hydroxyproline originate from either tissue matrix degradation or from dietary protein. They are not substrate for generic peptidases but instead circulate to tissues where they are hydrolyzed by prolidase. Our studies showed that the level of cellular prolidase is regulated by extracellular collagen acting through integrin receptors. Thus, the hydrolysis of imidodipetides, degradative products of matrix collagen and dietary proteins, is responsive to cellular interaction with extracellular matrix. In addition, imidodipeptides bind to certain members of the family of Peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerases (Rotamases) which have a wide spectrum of function from immunoregulation to apoptosis and cell cycle control. Interaction between imidodipeptides and rotamases are being studied. b. P5C as a signaling and regulatory molecule. P5C stimulates PRPP and purine ribonucleotide synthesis synergistically with certain growth factors and increases the entry of cells into S-phase. Recent studies suggest that P5C is synergistic with hypoxia in inducing expression of the gene for Nitric oxide synthase II (NOSII). Since NO can serve as an ubiquitous signaling molecule, some of the previously observed P5C effects may be mediated by NO. Preliminary results suggest that inhibitors of rotamase activity can block the P5C effect. c. Enzymes mediating the synthesis and degradation of P5C Because P5C has the aforementioned regulatory effects, the synthesis and degradation of P5C is of interest. Specifically, ornithine aminotransferase, P5C reductrase and P5C dehydrogenase are being studied. Using Northern blots, we are studying the expression of these enzymes in animals and in cultured cells. We found that the regulation of hepatic ornithine aminotrasferase by diet requires the presence of p53. In transgenic p53 knockout mice, regulation by dietary carbohydrate is attenuated. ',\n",
       " 'The interactions among retinoids and other nutrients as well as certain hormones and chemopreventive and or chemotherapeutic agents remain to be clarified. The relationship between these interactions and various carcinogenic processes are even less well characterized. We have carried out a number of complementary in vivo and in vitro studies to examine the mechanisms involved in retinoid-nutrient-drug interactions and their role in cancer. Based on our in vivo studies, we have developed physiologically based, mathematical compartmental models to describe the metabolism of retinoids and various retinoid interactions in a number of tissues. For example, our previous work has indicated that the synthetic retinoid 4HPR appears to interfere with normal uptake and or metabolism of vitamin A in the eyes and prostate as well as a number of other tissues examined. Our findings in the eyes have provided a possible explanation for the visual disturbances often observed in human trials using 4HPR. In contrast, administration of all-trans retinoic acid was not associated with similar types of perturbations in retinoid kinetics. To test the hypotheses derived from our in vivo models and to study the mechanisms involved in greater detail, we have screened and subsequently developed a number of in vitro systems specifically designed to simulate as closely as possible, the physiological responses we have observed in vivo. Thus far, we have carried out studies in a novel tissue culture system for human retinal pigment epithelium and a modified human prostate carcinoma cell line. Using HPLC and photodiode array analytical methods developed in our laboratory, we have studied the dynamics of a number of native and administered retinoids and drugs in these systems. Among other findings, we have demonstrated the presence of retinoid esterification activity in these systems as well as uptake and metabolism of different retinoids. We are presently characterizing how this activity as well related molecular events, such as expression of retinoid-binding proteins and nuclear retinoid receptors, are altered by various retinoid, nutrient, drug and hormonal treatments. For a collaborative project, we have developed methodology to simultaneously monitor native and administered retinoids in human plasma samples to be collected in a clinical study trial using 4HPR as a chemopreventive agent. In another collaborative project we are comparing the effects of several different retinoid treatments including 4HPR and several new variants of this retinoid, on metabolism of native retinoids and related molecular events, in a number of tissues including the eyes, prostate, liver, kidneys, and colon. For an additional collaborative study, we have developed methodology to isolate and monitor a number of carotenoid, retinoid, and tocopherol species in plasma and tissues. We are presently using this methodology to investigate how beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol supplementation in a p-53 deficient transgenic mouse model affect retinoid metabolism in a number of selected tissues.

       " 'Phase I enzymes like CYP1A1 and Phase 2 enzymes such as quinone reductase use NADPH as a reducing co-factor. NADPH, the major cellular source of reducing power, is generated by the pentose-phosphate pathway, which converts glucose-6-phosphate into NADPH and ribose. NADPH, in addition to serving as a cofactor for the enzymes listed above, also serves as a co-factor in the synthesis of reduced glutathione by glutathione reductase. Thus, this pathway is a central pathway in cellular defense against carcinogens and oxidant stress. The key regulator of this pathway, and therefore of NADPH levels, is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). This enzyme has long been thought to be a \"housekeeping\" gene that is constitutively expressed. However, recent studies have demonstrated that G6PD is, in fact, highly regulated and inducible. We have investigated changes in G6PD activity and expression in vitro in response to xenobiotics. We found that long-term exposure of cells to the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene caused an increase in the expression and activity of G6PD. This was not due to modulation of gene transcription, but was due to a post-transcriptional stabilization of G6PD mRNA. We have also found that certain dietary phytochemicals such as dibenzoylmethane and resveratrol increase the expression of G6PD by increasing gene transcription. We are currently examining how this activation occurs. Such increases in G6PD expression would be protective against carcinogens as well as oxidative stress in that it would increase the cell\\'s antioxidant capacity.',\n",
       " 'Cell surface peptide MHC complexes are ligands for T cell receptors (TcR) on CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes. Our research is aimed toward understanding the biochemical and functional details of MHC-peptide and [MHC peptide]-TcR interactions; these characterizations underlie a fundamental understanding of immune responses and the rational development of peptide-based immunotherapies. An emerging model of immune recognition maintains that the ability of TcR to engage dissimilar epitopes in a cross -reactive manner plays an important role in T cell development and peripheral function. We are currently studying how the TcR of a murine CTL clone recognizes two different peptide MHC class I complexes. This CTL was originally isolated as a xenoreactive clone specific for the human class I molecule HLA-A2.1 complexed with an endogenous human peptide. Since thymic selection theory maintains that T cells are positively-selected on self MHC peptide complexes, we reasoned that this murine CTL should be capable as well of recognizing some self (murine) class I molecule + peptide complex. We were able to identify a synthetic peptide which forms a complex with H-2 Db that is also recognized by this CTL clone. Analog peptides were used extensively to probe TcR epitope recognition in this system. Our findings suggest that the TcR of this CTL clone \"sees\" these two epitopes in a non-identical manner, making both shared and complex-specific contacts with each peptide class I combination. In a collaboration under way, we hope to obtain x-ray crystal structures of these two complexes and gain further structural insights into their topologies. The functional consequences of epitope degeneracy are being studied in the context of CTL response made in melanoma patients to HLA-A2.1 complexed with a peptide derived from the melanoma melanocyte protein MART-1. The recently-completed initial phase of this work provides evidence in support of our hypothesis that the high regularity of observed responses to this epitope may be due in part to T cell encounters with epitope mimics of the MART-1 peptide. The primary sequence of the MART peptide contains a hydrophobic motif that occurs frequently among a variety of functionally unrelated proteins, and many such MART-1-like sequences were identified that serve as cognate peptides for patient-derived CTL. We are currently beginning to study how mimicry might be influencing the efficacy of this anti-tumor CTL response. ',\n",
       " \"The goal of this project is the development and application of bioanalytical methods to: (1) establish the structure and purity of new antitumor agents and their metabolites, (2) determine physical, chemical and biochemical properties of new anticancer drugs and (3) measure drugs, their metabolites, and potential biomodulators and biomarkers in biological samples to elucidate in vitro and in vivo pharmacology and to determine in vivo pharmacokinetics. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the primary analytical approach. Cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPE-C), a carbocyclic nucleoside whose Phase I clinical trial was suspended because of severe and unpredictable hypotension, continues under collaborative study. CPE-C infusion studies in dogs with hemodynamic and pharmacologic monitoring have produced some similarities to patient hypotensive episodes, and the biochemical and pharmacological basis of this is being investigated. A tetrahydropyridoindole of novel structure has been identified and confirmed as an inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD), an enzyme required for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. This new compound possesses a potency equal to or greater than that of brequinar, a DHOD inhibitor that is an investigational antitumor agent. A study to compare hydrophobicity indices determined by liquid-liquid partitioning (log P) and reversed-phase HPLC (log k') for cytosine and adenine nucleosides of low lipophilicity showed a good, but less than perfect, correlation. Thus the use of HPLC to estimate the partition coefficients of moderately polar to very polar compounds is not as good as the direct determination of log P using our previously developed micro-shake flask method. \",\n",
       " 'The aim of this project is to better elucidate the role(s) of specific protein kinases in the regulation of cell growth and in malignant transformation. Since subcellular localization is important in determining the functional and regulatory specificity of protein kinases, studies were carried out to characterize the relationship between the domain organization and subcellular localization of protein kinase Ce (PKCe). A series of NIH3T3 cell lines were created, each overexpressing a different truncated version of PKCe. Holo PKCe was found to localize to the Golgi as well as to the plasma membrane, while the zinc-finger domain localized exclusively to the Golgi. Other domains of PKCe (pseudosubstrate and hinge regions) also were found to contain putative subcellular localization signals involved in targeting PKCe to subcellular fractions. In addition, these domains appear to influence the phorbol ester-induced translocation of PKCe from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Phorbol ester-induced translocation from the Golgi to the plasma membrane was observed to proceed by at least two mechanisms: a rapid, vesicle-independent process noted with holo PKCe, and a slow, vesicle-dependent pathway noted with the zinc-finger fragment. Previous studies have established that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity, as well as cAMP binding to its RI and RII regulatory subunits, are decreased in fibroblasts and erythrocytes isolated from patients with psoriasis. It now has been determined that exposure of normal human dermal fibroblasts in culture to hydrogen peroxide and to other oxygen free radical generating systems decreased PKA activity and also cAMP binding to the RI and RII regulatory subunits. Conversely, treatment of psoriatic fibroblasts with free radical scavenging agents restored the ability of RI and RII to bind cAMP toward normal levels. The protein levels of RI and RII are similar in normal and psoriatic fibroblasts, and were not changed by exposure to oxygen free radicals. These results suggest that oxidative modification may be an important regulatory mechanism for PKA, and that an altered oxidative state may be involved in mediating the decrease in PKA activity and cAMP binding noted in cells from psoriatic patients.

       " 'We are investigating the role of chromosomal proteins in determining the structure and regulating the function of chromatin. Transgenic animals, cell free chromatin assembly systems, and in vitro- reconstitution assays are used to determine the role of chromosomal proteins HMGN1 and HMGN2 in chromatin structure and nuclear function. These two proteins are the only nonhistone structural proteins known to specifically associate with the nucleosome core, which is the building block of the chromatin fiber. We found that these proteins unfold the higher order chromatin structure thereby facilitating access to the underlying DNA sequence and facilitating the orderly progression of various DNA-dependent actitvitis in the context of chromatin. By confocal immunofluorescence we find that the HMGN2 protein colocalizes with nascent transcripts. This colocalization is dynamic and reversible and may be regulated by post-translational modifications. We also find that the proteins are not always associated with DNA and actively shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, in a cell-cycle dependent manner. This shuttling is affected by phoshporylation of specific residues in the proteins. Our studies suggest that the intracellular trafficking and localization of these proteins is in part regulated be specific postranslational modifications. We also find that the histone acetyl transferase and transciptional coactivator p300, acetylates HMGN proteins at multiple sites. All of the sites, which were mapped both in vivo and in vitro, are in evolutionarily conserved domains suggesting that this modification may be an important aspect of the celular function of the protein. We have also devised a new strategy for characterizing the parameters governing the binding of HMGs and other proteins to chromatin subunits. These studies provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms whereby specific nuclear proteins regulate the strucure of chromatin and affect numerous DNA-related activities in the nucleus of the cell. We have created knock out mouse for HMGN1. This mouse displays pleiotropic effects on gene regualtion and cells derived from the mouse have tumorigenic and have diminshed ability to respond to stress. The mice have an altered hair growth cycle and display changes in skin growth chracteristics. These properties are the basis of a paten tapplication which proposes to use the HMGN1 pathway to affect wound healing and perhaps affect stm cell growth. The knock-out mice and tissues derived from it provide new investigative approaches for studies on the role of chromatin in gene regulation and cancer etiology.',\n",
       " 'CLIC4 (Chloride intracellular channel 4) is a member of a family of intracellular chloride channel proteins that are ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue types. In keratinocytes and other cell types, cytoplasmic CLIC4 translocates to the nucleus under conditions of metabolic stress, growth arrest, apoptosis and DNA damage. Nuclear targeting of CLIC4 to basal undifferentiated keratinocytes causes cell cycle arrest and terminal differentiation. CLIC4 is excluded from the nucleus in epithelial cancer cells but upregulated in tumor stroma. CLIC4 is a direct downstream effector of p53, c-Myc and PPAR beta. Nuclear translocation of CLIC4 is defective in cancer cells. Thus, understanding the control of nuclear trafficking in normal cells is essential to dissect the defect in cancer cells. Nitric oxide directly enhances nuclear translocation of CLIC4 and modifies it on specific cysteine residue(s) by S-nitrosylation. NO-induced S-nitrosylation enhances association of wildtype CLIC4 with the nuclear import proteins Ran, importin alpha and NTF2. Preliminary molecular modeling in collaboration with Jinhui Ding show cysteines 35 and 234 in close proximity to each other in the folded protein and nitrosylation of cysteine 234 may induce conformational changes to link cysteine 234 to cysteine 35 through two water molecules. Mutations targeted at all four cysteine residues show that cysteine 35 is essential for protein stability and mutation of the thiol (to alanine or serine) leads to proteasome-mediated degradation. Remarkably, cysteine 35 also seems to regulate S-nitrosylation of the protein as mutants (alanine and serine) of cysteine 35 show hyper S-nitrosylation even in untreated cells. This increased S-nitrosylation likely occurs at cysteine 234 as a double mutant (cysteine to serine) at positions 35 and 234 shows no S-nitrosylation. In addition, the mutation of cysteine 35 results in marked nuclear distribution that is likely a consequence of its enhanced association with the nuclear import proteins Ran and importin alpha. Thus cysteine 35 may be an allosteric or catalytic regulator of S-nitrosylation and the subcellular distribution of CLIC4. Our current results suggest that both iNOS and eNOS participate in nitrosylation of CLIC4 critical cysteines and changes in redox state in cancer cells and particularly these enzyme systems could alter potential for nuclear localization of CLIC4 in tumors. We have recently discovered that TGFbeta enhances the expression and nuclear translocation of CLIC4 in association with Schnurri-2 in keratinocytes. In turn, nuclear CLIC4 enhances TGFbeta signaling, independent of Schnurri-2. Nuclear CLIC4 enhances TGFbeta signal transduction by increasing the levels of phospho-Smad2, a key mediator of the TGFbeta response. CLIC4 physically interacts with phospho-Smad2 and prevents phosphatase mediated dephosphorylation of Smad2, thereby enhancing and prolonging the TGFbeta signal. Nuclear CLIC4 specifically inhibits the interaction of phospho-Smad2 with PPM1a which is the only known Smad phosphatise. CLIC4 may however also interact with other hitherto undetected Smad phosphatases. CLIC4 is strongly associated with myofibroblast conversion in the stroma of multiple tumor types. CLIC4 overexpression in primary mouse dermal fibroblasts enhances the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin. Fibroblast transdifferentiation by TGFbeta depends on ERK activation. CLIC4 overexpression enhances phosphorylation of ERK and synergizes with TGFbeta in activating ERK. These data show that CLIC4 may participate in the stromal reaction to cancer by virtue of its role as a TGFbeta pathway modifier. We are currently at the chimeric stage in the development of skin targeted CLIC4 null mouse using recombineering methods. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, HER1, ErbB1) is activated by mutation, amplification or ligand over-expression in skin carcinomas. It was discovered that cutaneous folliculitis is a dose limiting toxicity of systemic inhibition of EGFR for cancer therapy. Similar lesions were detected in the skin of mice where EGFR has been genetically deleted, and we have used keratinocytes from these mice, and their ras oncogene transformed derivatives, to identify critical pathways involved in the inflammatory response. Microarray analysis performed on cDNA from ras transformed mouse keratinocytes derived from wildtype or EGFR null mice or treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG1478, PD153035, or Tarceva generated a 25 gene signature for EGFR ablation. Pathway analysis of the EGFR signature demonstrated the possible involvement of p38 in EGFR ablation. In ras infected keratinocytes, p38 mediated inhibition of ERK1 2 is lost, which also occurs in cells from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. In EGFR ablated samples total p38, and p38 alpha are unchanged where as p38 delta is up-regulated. Further studies on p38 delta should clarify the involvement of this isoform in toxicity to EGFR inhibitors. Cytokine induced expression of Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) is dependent upon EGFR activity in human and mouse keratinocytes. A mouse model where EGFR is ablated only in the skin develops skin inflammation characterized by cycles of hair growth and hair loss. EGFR conditional knockout mice display higher numbers of circulating neutrophils (12 fold), eosinophils (23 fold) and basophils (4 fold) relative to their single transgenic littermates. No differences were observed in lymphocyte counts. CD45 antigen is increased in the skin tissue sections of the conditional null mice. Cutaneous leukocyte abundance is further increased upon painting the dorsal skin of the mice with TPA. While transcripts for a subset of inflammatory mediators (MIP-2, MIP-3alpha, MCP-1 and GM-CSF) are elevated in the total skin extracts of ablated mice, epidermal GM-CSF is lower. These data suggest that in the absence of a functional EGFR pathway, the proinflammatory milieu in the skin cannot fully induce the expression of GM-CSF in keratinocytes, while the leukocyte populations retain GM-CSF expression during the inflammatory response causing the overall increase of this cytokine in total skin extracts. In the skin of 3 hr post partum mice through 5 months of age, mast cells significantly increase in the absence of epidermal EGFR starting from day 7. By the third week of age these mice display pruritus, and it is likely that the increased mast cell component in their skin is linked to the worsening of their skin condition. Furthermore, plasma samples obtained from young and older conditional EGFR null or control littermates defined a Th17 prone environment. In the EGFR conditional knockouts higher levels of IL-17, IL-6 and IP-10 (CXCL-10) were measured in both acute and chronic conditions. Additional changes in circulating chemokines distinguished the EGFR conditional null mice for their control littermates indicating the global scope of the immunological abnormalities that epidermal ablation of the EGFR can cause at the systemic level. We anticipate that many of these changes will be translatable to the adverse skin phenotype in cancer patients receiving anti-EGFR therapy. In collaboration with Dolph Hatfield, we are studying two genetically altered mouse strain [summary truncated at 7800 characters]',\n",
       " 'Molecular, cellular and clinical abnormalities are being studied in 2 genetic diseases with cellular hypersensitivity to environmental agents and increased cancer risk: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and dysplastic nevus syndrome (DNS) of familial melanoma. We developed new assays to measure DNA repair and mutagenesis at the molecular level in human cells using plasmid vectors. We found that introduction of cloned DNA repair genes substantially corrected the UV mutagenic defect in XP-D and XP-A cells. XP-D and XP-A fibroblasts containing transfected ERCC2 and XPAC genes, respectively, were found to have increased repair and decreased mutagenesis of UV-treated plasmids. The types of UV-induced mutations in the plasmids became more like those from normal cells. Studies of lymphoblastoid cells from normal donors showed increased plasmid UV mutability with increasing donor age. Lymphoblastoid cell lines from DNS patients with melanoma were found to have abnormally elevated mutability of UV-treated plasmids, a possible cellular marker for this genetic disorder. Chemoprevention of skin cancer in XP with oral 13-cis retinoic acid (RA) (Accutane) was studied. We found that a high dose (2 mg kg da) of 13-cis RA was effective in preventing skin cancers but very toxic, and that low dose (0.5 mg kg da) drug gave variable response in different patients ranging from almost complete tumor prevention to no beneficial effect. Despite extensive sun protection, XP patients had normal levels of serum vitamin D, indicating an adequate dietary intake of vitamin D. Therapeutic injection of intralesional interferon resulted in marked clearing of multiple melanoma in situ lesions in one XP patient. The anatomic location of skin cancers in XP patients indicates that although UV exposure causes both melanoma and non-melanoma cancer, the mechanism of skin cancer induction is different for each type of cancer.

       " \"Certain transition metals like nickel, chromium, and cadmium, are carcinogenic to humans, especially in the industrial environment (e.g., metallurgy and welding); however, the mechanisms of their carcinogenic activity remain obscure. In recent years, we have formulated a novel hypothesis that one such mechanism would involve metal-mediated oxidative damage to DNA and nuclear proteins. By testing that hypothesis, we revealed previously that the metals did, indeed, induce DNA base damage in vitro and in vivo in a way typical for oxygen radical attack. In 1995 96 we continued mechanistic studies on that hypothesis. Our in vitro study, focused on redox activity of nickel complex system with a metal-binding peptide, CH3CO-Cys-Ala-Ile-His-NH2 (L) (metal-binding motif of histone H3), confirmed its high catalytic potential toward oxidation of 2'-deoxy-guanosine (dG) to promutagenic 8-oxo-dG. That activity was assigned specifically to a weak Ni(II) complex with L-dimer, a minor constituent of the complex system. Another in vitro investigation, focused on 8-oxo-dGTPases, a class of enzymes which prevent incorporation of promutagenic 8-oxo-dGTP into genomic DNA, revealed inhibition by Ni(II) of such bacterial and human enzymes (MutT and MTH-1, respectively), a phenomenon that may augment oxidative DNA damage. In an in vivo experiment on the repair of oxidative DNA base damage, the damage was determined in kidneys and livers of F344 rats following a single i.p. injection of Ni(II) acetate. Damaged DNA bases were found in chromatin of both organs one day after treatment. However, in the liver, the damage was repaired promptly, whereas in the kidney it persisted for up to 2 weeks, implying inefficient DNA repair specifically in the kidney, the target organ for nickel carcinogenesis. The results may indicate Ni(II) mediation of oxidative DNA damage through direct (redox catalysis) and indirect (inhibition of DNA repair) mechanisms. Overall, our work yields data supporting the oxidative hypothesis of metal-mediated carcinogenesis and also provides an experimental basis for collaborative studies on oxidative damage by other carcinogenic insults (see ZO1 BC 05352 and ZO1 BC 05301). \",\n",
       " '1. Estrogen (E2) induces proliferation and squamous differentiation of the cervical and vaginal epithelium during the estrous cycle, while progesterone and retinoids maintain the simple columnar epithelium of the endocervix and uterine horns. We have defined the effects of ovariectomy and subsequent estrogen administration on the differentiation of mouse ectocervical epithelium. We have investigated whether retinoid receptors (RARs and RXRs) are responsive to estrogen status during cervical epithelial differentiation induced by a single dose of estrogen in ovariectomized adult mice. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a prolonged induction of RXRalpha and RARgamma gene expression by E2 in the mouse cervix and vagina. The induction of these retinoid receptors suggests that they may be implicated in epithelial growth and differentiation in response to E2. Moreover, potential heterodimeric interactions among these receptors indicates that normal, cyclical epithelial differentiation results from the interplay of these molecules. The induction of RXRalpha and RARgamma by E2, and their expression pattern in relation to ER suggest that they are needed to coordinate specific genetic programs that result in cervical epithelial growth and differentiation. 2. RARalpha protein is reduced in high risk papillomas, relative to low risk papillomas, and the promoting agent mezerein, that induces high risk papillomas, causes a substantial reduction in RARalpha in non- tumorous skin. Transducing cultured normal keratinocytes with v-rasHa reduces RARalpha and gamma proteins in nuclear extracts and decreases RAR mediated transcriptional activity. Introduction of a recombinant RARalpha expression vector into papilloma cells inhibits growth in response to retinoic acid. Modulation of RARs could contribute to the neoplastic phenotype directly or indirectly through interaction with AP-1 and may be involved in the differential promoting activity of mezerein and TPA, thereby influencing the selection of tumors at high risk for malignant conversion.

       " 'We have undertaken a program that is aimed at determining, on a molecular level, those genetic alterations in primary breast tumor DNA that have a statistically significant association with the patients history, characteristics of the tumor, and the patients prognosis. The most frequent type of mutation is loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific regions of the cellular genome in tumor DNA. Approximately 20 such regions have been identified in breast tumor DNAs. One of these is located on chromosome 17q12-q21. Using polymorphic markers from this region we were able to show that the 120-150 kb interval between D17S846 and D17S746 represents the smallest common region which is deleted. To identify the target gene(s) for LOH we are currently determining the nucleotide sequence of two overlapping P1 phage clones which span this region. We have found two candidate target genes. One of these is the gene (PLAK) encoding plakoglobin, a component of the cadherin-catenin complex which anchors actin filaments at adherens junctions of epithelial cells. The gene is composed of 13 exons which span 13 kb at the non overlapping end of one of the P1 phage clones. No mutations were found in nine breast tumor cell lines by SSCP analysis (SK-BR-3, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-231, T-47D, BT-20, MDA-MB-468, HS 578T, MCF-7, and BT-474). Similarly, no mutations were detected in genomic DNA or cDNA fromeleven breast tumors known to have LOH in the region containing PLAK. A second candidate gene has been identified in the region of overlap between the two P1 phage clones. It is a member of a family of genes encoding immunophilins which are highly conserved intracellular receptors. Currently we are determining the organization of this gene and whether it is mutated in breast tumors having LOH on 17q12-q21. ',\n",
       " 'The TGF-b family of ligands signal through a unique heteromeric receptor complex distinguished by its serine-threonine kinase activity. One signal transduction pathway from these receptors involves a novel family of proteins termed Smads, which are related to Drosophila Mad, a cytoplasmic mediator of signals from a TGF-b family ligand, dpp. We have demonstrated that one of these, Smad4, identical to a candidate tumor suppressor for pancreatic cancer, DPC4, can restore TGF-b signal transduction pathways in tumor cells null for Smad4. By constructing chimeric and mutated forms of Smad4, we have shown that the ligand- dependency resides in its unique proline-rich linker and N-terminal domain inserts. Ongoing studies are aimed at characterization of the functional activity associated with these domains. Other studies are focused on characterization of two novel clones we have isolated from a yeast two-hybrid system using Smad1 as bait. The proteins show no identifiable enzymatic motifs or homology to existing proteins. They suggest additional complexity to these signal transduction pathways in that they inhibit Smad-induced reporter gene activity. We are currently characterizing the interaction patterns and mechanisms of action of these proteins. In other studies, we have demonstrated that Smads may mediate cross-talk between serine-threonine kinase receptors and certain tyrosine kinase receptors, in that both HGF and EGF can phosphorylate Smad1 and Smad2 in cells lacking TGF-b receptors. HGF can also stimulate nuclear translocation of Smad2, suggesting that the overlapping activities of TGF-b and HGF in activation of certain target genes such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are mediated by a Smad-dependent pathway. To delineate more fully the extent of Smad-mediated pathways in transduction of signals from TGF-b family ligands, we have generated mice null for Smad1 and plan to create transgenic mice expressing dominant Smad1 and 2 under control of tissue-specific promoters. The Smad1 null mice die between days 8 and 9 of embryogenesis, demonstrating a critical signaling role for this molecule in early development. We plan to backcross transgenic mice expressing dominant negative Smads with mice heterozygous for Smad1 and for Smads 2, 3, and 4 (obtained collaboratively from Chuxia Deng) to enhance the phenotype of compromised Smad activity.

       " 'Among the most basic questions remaining in biology are what are the inductive molecules that commit stem cells to a particular pathway of differentiation and what prevents this commitment in tumorigenesis While in vitro systems for studying tissue-specific induction and development have been available in some cases for more than 40 years, the molecules that direct these processes remain elusive. For kidney, it has long been possible in culture to induce tubules in undifferentiated metanephric mesenchyme by recombining isolated mesenchyme with an inductive tissue but not by using soluble factors. We have devised tissue culture models that permit differentiation in the absence of an inductive tissue and are using these models to define the functional secreted patterning molecules critical to normal renal development. Previously, we demonstrated that basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) induces the early events in renal tubulogenesis, including upregulation of the critical molecules, Wt1, wnt- 4, and pax-2 and compaction of the mesenchyme. We find now that it probably also mediates the divergent differentiation of metanephric mesenchyme to form nephrogenic blastemal cells and stromal mesenchyme. This is based on the reciprocal expression patterns of hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor c-met in cultured mesenchymes following bFGF treatment. More importantly, we have also established that a cell line (RUB-1) derived in our lab from the ureteric bud, the natural inductive tissue for metanephric mesenchyme, secretes an inductive molecule(s) for renal tubulogenesis and glomerulogenesis. In characterizing the RUB-1 line, we have found that it expresses the secreted patterning molecules, bone morphogenetic protein-7 and wnt7B, as well as several members of the fgf family, i.e., fgf1, fgf2, and fgf9. We are currently assessing the activities of BMP-7 and WNT-7B in combination with an FGF in morphogenesis as we continue to purify the inductive activity secreted by RUB-1 cells. These studies suggest that soluble factors similar to those implicated in the development of other tissues are also involved in renal morphogenesis, and this system provides a powerful approach to examining the relevance of various BMPs, FGFs, and WNTs in the induction process. Furthermore, identification of the factors critical to development should permit insight into possible targets of carcinogens which when altered might block stem cell commitment and cause tumor formation.

       " 'Int6 Expression Predicts Survival in Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients. The Int6 gene was originally identified as a common insertion site for the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) in virally induced mouse mammary tumors. Recent studies indicate that Int6 is a polyhedric protein involved in the regulation of protein translation and degradation through binding with three cellular complexes: the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), the proteasome regulatory lid, and the COP9 signalosome. In the present study, we have determined the steady state levels of Int6 RNA by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in 101 human lung tumors and matched normal lung tissues obtained from stage I non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) patients with long-term follow-up. In 27% of the tumors Int6 RNA levels were reduced relative to normal tissue. In 85% of the tumors with reduced Int6 RNA levels the transcription promoter and first exon were hypermethylated, whereas only 4% of the tumors with elevated Int6 RNA levels were hypermethylated (P<0.000001). Low levels of Int6 RNA were found to be a significant predictor of overall and disease-free survival (p= 0.0004 and p= 0.0020, respectively). A multivariate analysis confirmed that low Int6 RNA level was the only independent and significant factor to predict poor prognosis, for both overall (P = 0.0006) and disease-free (P = 0.024) survival. Overexpression of human Cripto-1 in transgenic mice impairs mammary gland development and differentiation and induces mammary tumorigenesis. Cripto-1, a member of the EGF-CFC gene family, performs an important role in vertebrate development. Overexpression of Cripto-1 has been reported in several types of cancer in mice and humans, including human breast cancer. To investigate the role of human Cripto-1 in mammary gland development and carcinogenesis, we have developed transgenic mice expressing of the human Cripto-1 gene under the regulation of the whey acidic protein (WAP) promoter in FVB N mice. We found that the Cripto-1 transgene begins to be expressed during late-pregnancy and that b-casein expression was suppressed in the pregnant mammary glands of WAP-Cripto-1 transgenic mice compared to FVB N mice. During early lactation alveolar structures in the mammary glands of WAP-Cripto-1 expressing mice were less differentiated and delayed in their development compared to FVB N mice. As a result, WAP-Cripto-1 females have impaired lactation as compared to FVB N mice. Involution is enhanced in the mammary glands of WAP-Cripto-1 mice compared to FVB N mice. These results indicate that Cripto-1 inhibits mammary gland development differentiation and enhanced apoptosis. In addition, 15 out of 30 Wap-Cripto-1 multiparous females developed mammary tumors. These tumors exhibit a phenotype that is similar to mammary tumors that are induced by Wnt-1. The role of cKit in \"activated\" Notch4 Int3 induced mammary tumors. Differential display analysis of RNA from mammary tissue of pregnant normal FVB and WAP-Notch4 Int3 ICD mice and a mammary tumor from a WAP-Notch4 Int3 ICD female showed that high levels of cKit were detectable in the tumor compared normal pregnant FVB mammary tissue. Intermediate levels of cKit RNA was present in mammary tissue from pregnant WAP-Notch4 Int3 ICD females. In fact all mammary tumors from WAP-Notch4 Int3 ICD, MMTV LTR-Notch4 Int3 ICD, and WAP-Notch4 Int3sh transgenic mice express high levels of cKit. The drug Gleevec has been shown to specifically inhibit the activity of cAbl, cKit, PDGFR tyrosine kinases. We have treated WAP-Notch4 Int3 ICD tumor bearing mice with increasing amounts of Gleevec. In these mice the tumors either regresses or remains stationary in size. This suggests that in the context of \"activated\" Notch4 Int3 cKit activity is both necessary and sufficient for mammary tumor growth.',\n",
       " 'The Carcinogen-DNA Interactions Section investigates both the extent of DNA adduct formation and persistence, and the biological consequences of DNA damage. We utilize experimental models and human subjects, with the intention of applying the knowledge gained to elucidate mechanisms of cancer causation and approaches to cancer prevention in humans. One goal is to ascertain an association between DNA adduct formation and human cancer risk. Ongoing studies in 3 different populations are focused on the validation of human polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-DNA adduct formation as a biomarker for risk of human cancer. In US Navy officers a 2-fold increased risk of colon adenoma was found in individuals with the highest leukocyte PAH-DNA adduct level. Using esophageal samples from Linxian, China, where the esophageal cancer mortality rate is 20%, we have validated PAH-DNA adduct semi-quantitative measurements by immunohistochemistry in biopsies taken in 1985 and 1994, and currently we are investigating a possible association between PAH-DNA adduct formation and cancer risk within a prospective nested case-control study design. Finally, we measured PAH-DNA adducts in cervix biopsies from women infected with human papilloma virus (HPV), and we are examining the association between HPV status, PAH-DNA adducts in cervix and a documented smoking-related increase in cervical cancer risk. The potential formation of tamoxifen (TAM)-DNA adducts in human endometrium is a controversial topic of interest, as TAM-exposed women are at risk for endometrial cancer. Modeling of human TAM exposures in female cynomolgus monkeys revealed TAM-DNA adduct formation in ovary and uterus, but our current efforts to measure TAM-DNA adducts in human endometrium have been inconclusive. To validate methods used for TAM-DNA determination in human samples we organized an interlaboratory study using rat liver DNA, and demonstrated similarity for all the methods. Hypothesizing that TAM-induced gene expression changes may provide insight into breast tissue response, TAM-exposed cultured normal human mammary epithelial cell (NHMEC) strains were subjected to microarray. We found up-regulation of immune response genes in 3 strains, suggesting a novel mechanism of TAM activity in the breast.DNA damage response was explored in mouse keratinocytes ablated for the p21WAF1 Cip1 gene, and the data suggest that this gene may have a DNA repair-like function in mouse skin cells Drug combinations that include one or two antiretroviral nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are standard of care therapy for individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, mitochondrial toxicities can limit NRTI use, and genotoxicity studies suggest that exposure may confer a long-term cancer risk. Currently we are investigating genotoxicity and mitochondrial toxicity associated with NRTIuse, with special focus on fetal consequences of maternal NRTI exposures during pregnancy. Since the last Site Visit unique methods have been developed to measure incorporation of the NRTI Lamivudine (3TC) into DNA, to quantify mtDNA levels in human and monkey tissues, and to determine mitochondrial gene expression by mitochondrial microarray. In cell culture studies that employed transformed human cell lines (HeLa and MOLT-3) and NHMEC strains, exposure to the NRTI Zidovudine (AZT) induced accumulation of cells in S-phase, accompanied by cell cycle gene expression changes consistent with the S-phase arrest. In addition, exposure of MOLT-3 cells to AZT for r5 passages resulted in loss of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), the enzyme responsible for AZT mono-phosphorylation, suggesting a mechanism for drug resistance. Long-term mitochondrial toxicity was examined in HeLa cells exposed to AZT for 71 passages.',\n",
       " 'Research involves the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches to cancer, including the design and analyses of recombinant vaccines directed against gene products of oncogenes and antigens overexpressed in tumors. Vaccine targets include human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), point mutated ras oncogenes, prostate specific antigen (PSA), the muc-1 breast, lung, and pancreatic associated mucin, and the c-erbB 2 oncogene. Vehicles for vaccine delivery for induction of host cellular immune responses include recombinant vaccinia (rV), replication defective avian pox viruses, DNA plasmids, peptides, and recombinant proteins. A Phase I clinical trial recently completed demonstrated that advanced carcinoma patients vaccinated with a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the CEA gene (rV-CEA) could elicit cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses to the self antigen CEA. The actual epitopes recognized by these T-cells were defined and used to establish CTL lines and clones. The utility of these and other CTL lines in the adoptive transfer of epitope specific T-cells lines is currently under investigation.Vaccine trials employing CEA CTL peptides, recombinant CEA, and replication defective avian pox virus recombinants containing CEA, alone and in combination with rV-CEA, are being designed. Studies are ongoing in the elucidation and analyses of agonist and antagonist peptides of the identified CEA CTL immunodominant epitopes. Initial studies have indicated that peptides can be designed that are more efficient than the natural peptide in the generation of cytotoxic T-cell lines. Studies are also ongoing with a recombinant vaccinia PSA vaccine, and PSA CTL immunodominant epitope peptides recently identified. A Phase I clinical trial is now in progress in which peptides reflecting ras oncogene point mutations at codon 12 are administered to patients whose tumors have been shown to contain the individual mutation. These studies have shown the induction of both CD4+ helper T-cells and CD8+ CTL specific for the mutated ras peptide and not proto-ras or other mutations. Ongoing studies include the use of multidimensional fusion proteins as immunogens and the exploitation of T-cell co-stimulatory molecules in both gene therapy and vaccine strategies. ',\n",
       " 'There are two types of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA), type I (PKA-I) and type II (PKA-II), which contain an identical catalytic (C) subunit but have distinct regulatory (R) subunits, RI and RII, respectively. Evidence suggests that increased expression of PKA-I and its regulatory subunit (RIa) underlies tumorigenesis and tumor growth.Our studies include: (1) Antisense strategy. Antisense oligonucleotide targeted against the RIa subunit of PKA is used to demonstrate that the sequence-specific inhibition of RIa gene expression inhibits tumor growth. The results are confirmed by the use of siRNA, and the clinical utility of antisense RIa is confirmed by the findings that antisense RIa acts synergistically with cytotoxic drugs currently in use and CpG immune-modulatory oligonucleotides. Our laboratory was the first to show the genome-wide effects of antisense inhibition of gene expression in microarrays. Using in vivo tumor models of PC3M human prostate carcinoma grown in nude mice, the specificity of RIa antisense effects on gene expression signatures was critically assessed using three oligonucleotides that differed in sequence or chemical modification. Antisense treatment was found to downregulate one cluster, or signature, of genes involved in cell proliferation and upregulate another involved in cell differentiation. Importantly, these expression signatures were quiescent and unaltered in the livers of antisense-treated animals. Thus, cDNA microarray analysis defined the molecular portrait of a reverted tumor phenotype in antisense-treated regressing tumors. (2) Retroviral vector-mediated overexpression of wild-type and point-mutated R and C subunits of PKA is used to study cell growth, differentiation, and reverse transformation of tumor cells. The results obtained from the study of PC3M cells via classical biochemical analysis, DNA microarrays, and confocal microscopy demonstrated that cancer cells exhibit abnormal expression of PKA isozymes that constitute malignant phenotype, and correction of this abnormal PKA profile achieved by differential expression of the PKA R subunit genes provides a novel tumor target-based gene therapy of cancer. In OVAR-8 ovarian carcinoma cells, the molecular portraits of the distinct phenotype induced by differential R subunit gene overexpression identified the distinct disease-dependent expression profiles of clinical tumors. Many of these genes had been previously identified in clinical studies as upregulated in progressively transformed ovarian tissues as compared to normal counterparts. Analysis of pathway involvement showed active involvement of the differential signaling genes contained within the ERK MAPK signaling pathway versus genes in the Wnt a signaling pathway. This result suggests that perturbation of the PKA-I to PKA-II ratio in the cell is an abnormal dangerous signal that may underlie tumorigenesis and tumor progression. This study thus suggests that protein kinase A isozyme switching in the cell might provide a novel tumor target-based gene therapy of human cancer. (3) Effect of CRE-transcription factory decoy oligonucleotides: Our previous studies showed that the CRE-decoy inhibits the CRE- and Ap1-directed transcription and inhibits cancer cell growth selectively without harming normal cell growth (Park, et al., J Biol Chem, 1999). It was found that in cancer cells, CREB (CRE-binding protein) phosphorylation by ERK MAPK signaling overrides that by cAMP PKA signaling, whereas, growth factor-mediated CREB phosphorylation is minimal in normal cells.',\n",
       " 'The goal of Dr. Klee and her colleagues is to elucidate the mechanism of stimulus-response coupling mediated by Ca2+ and calmodulin. The regulation of the calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase, calcineurin, recently identified as the target of immunosuppressive drugs, is used as a model system. The role of the regulatory subunit, calcineurin B, in the folding and activation of calcineurin has been the focus of attention during the past year. The calcineurin B-binding domain of calcineurin A has been identified and shown to be required to reconstitute an active enzyme. The residues of calcineurin B which are affected by binding of a synthetic calcineurin A peptide have been determined by multidimensional NMR in collaboration with Jacob Anglister and Ad Bax (NIDDK). Zhong-Hua Gao has constructed and expressed in E. coli calcineurin B mutants deficient in Ca2+ binding to either one of the four Ca2+ sites. The ability of these mutants to interact with and support the Ca2+-dependent activation of the beta-isoform of calcineurin and its calmodulin-independent derivative reconstituted from its subunits expressed in E. coli by Hao Ren is under study. The specific inhibition of calcineurin by the immunosuppressive drug FK506 complexed with its binding protein, FKBP12, was used by Xutong Wang to show that in situ, calcineurin is 10-20 times more active than is purified calcineurin, and is subject to a time- and Ca2+ calmodulin-dependent reversible inactivation facilitated by small, heat stable, inactivator(s). A factor that prevents the inactivation of calcineurin in vitro and in vivo was identified as superoxide dismutase, suggesting that the inactivation is the result of oxidative damage to the Fe-Zn active center of calcineurin. The involvement of the redox state of iron in the regulation of calcineurin activity provides a mechanism to desensitize the enzyme and to couple Ca2+-dependent protein dephosphorylation to the redox state of the cell. The protection of calcineurin against inactivation by superoxide dismutase adds a new aspect to the physiological roles of superoxide dismutase, namely, the modulation of Ca2+-dependent regulation of cellular processes by protein phosphorylation. Lack of this protective effect could be associated with diseases caused by superoxide dismutase mutations as, for example, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ',\n",
       " 'CBP p300 are important coactivators for several transcription factors including CREB, nuclear hormone receptors, NF- B and p53. Recent experiments suggest that CBP p300 mediate gene activation through effects on chromatin remodeling, but interactions with basal transcription factors have also been proposed. To analyze CBP transcription activation, we have utilized an in vitro transcription assay that allows the analysis of transcription initiation and reinitiation in the absence of chromatin effects. Addition of Tax and a N-terminal fragment of CBP (amino acids 1-682) to the in vitro transcription reactions increased both full-length and shorter transcripts resulting from initiation and reinitiation. A CBP deletion mutant lacking the N-terminal activation domain was inactive. Analysis of the interaction of Tax with full-length endogenous CBP indicates that a transcriptionally active complex of Tax CBP RNA pol II can be immunoprecipitated from cell extracts. We propose that CBP activates transcription in vivo not only by loosening chromatin structure by its histone acetylase function, but also by directly promoting transcription initiation and reinitiation through Tax-responsive CREB binding.

       " 'The determination, proliferation and differentiation of muscle cells during development in both vertebrates and invertebrates depend upon the complex regulated expression, dimerization and function of the MyoD family of basic helix-loop-helix proteins. We have continued to study the role of the MyoD related proteins during vertebrate and Drosophila myogenesis. In the vertebrates, the MyoD family of muscle gene regulatory proteins or MRFs, were thought to directly auto regulate their expression levels through MRF binding sites in the promoters of these genes. However, we have demonstrated that this pathway is indirect, at least for avian MyoD (CMD1), and does not involve any presently known muscle-specific transcription factors. In Drosophila we have shown that the single MyoD gene, nau is not auto regulated but expression depends upon an earlier mesodermal transcription factor, DMEF2. The single DMEF2 gene encodes a MADS domain containing SRF homologue essential for muscle formation in Drosophila. DMEF2 is expressed just after the onset of twist expression, the key mesodermal determination gene in flies. Our studies indicate that, in addition to DMEF2, twist also regulates nau in cultured Drosophila cells, suggesting twist is epistatic to nau and is a possible regulator of nau during embryogenesis at the earliest point of mesoderm formation. The MyoD family of proteins are phosphoproteins. Two adjacent serine residues outside the HLH domain in the carboxy terminal portion of vertebrate MyoD regulate the formation of the homodimer in vitro and in vivo. This site and its function are conserved in nau. Phosphorylation of this site also regulates a transcriptional activation domain and may be responsive to signal transduction pathways that modulate MyoD function. We have demonstrated the importance of dimerization specificity among the MyoD E-protein family members by using a newly developed competitive EMSA, demonstrating the heterodimer dependent myogenic conversion of nonmuscle cells from both vertebrates and Drosophila, and conducting the rescue of a MyoD lethal mutation in C. elegans with Drosophila MyoD, a predicted heterodimer partner from our studies on dimerization specificity. MyoD is not only a transcription factor but also appears to play a role in the decision to exit the cell cycle during differentiation. Preliminary experiments indicate that MyoD can regulate CDK function in a concentration dependent manner, inhibiting the phosphorylation of Rb. The fragment of MyoD containing the CDK binding site can itself inhibit cell growth. ',\n",
       " 'Our group has continued studies of chromatin structure and the regulation of heat shock gene expression, with emphasis on the structure and function of the heat shock transcription factor (HSF) and on the remodeling of the heat shock gene promoter in chromatin. Protease mapping of the global physical structure of HSF and characterization of Drosophila carrying mutations in the HSF gene was completed. The genetic studies revealed a novel developmental function for HSF that appears to be unrelated to its characteristic activity as a stress-responsive transcriptional activator. Biophysical studies of HSF oligomerization were initiated in order to determine the equilibrium dissociation constants for the monomer-trimer transition, the first step of HSF activation by heat shock. Our group has also continued work on the ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) discovered in this laboratory. Two additional subunits of NURF (NURF-55 and NURF 38) have been characterized. NURF-55 was discovered to be related to RbAp48, a protein previously found to bind in vitro to retinoblastoma and currently found as a component of several protein complexes involved in histone metabolism. We are currently analyzing the role of NURF in facilitating transcriptional stimulation of chromatin templates in vitro and are investigating the structural determinants of nucleosomes that are essential for the activity of NURF in reconfiguring nucleosome structure.

       " 'Nm23 genes have been implicated in the control of tumor metastasis. For many types of tumors there is an inverse relationship between the level of nm23 expression and metastatic potential. Transfection of nm23 into highly metastatic cell lines reduces their metastatic potential. Nm23 genes are also thought to be involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Nm23 genes encode nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDP kinases). These enzymes catalyze the phosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphates to triphosphates and are responsible for maintaining nucleoside triphosphate pools. However, the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates does not appear to explain the role of nm23 in suppressing metastasis. We have found that nm23 protiens have protein kinase or phosphotransferase activities. We have previously reported that rat NDP kinase can phosphorylate ATP-citrate lyase. This phosphorylation results from a direct transfer of a phosphate from a histidine on NDP kinase to a histidine on ATP-citrate lyase. We subsequently found that NDP kinase can phosphorylate a histidine on succinyl thiokinase. The physiological significance of the phosphorylation of ATP-citrate lyase and succinyl thiokinase by NDP kinase is unclear as they are phosphorylated much more rapidly by ATP than by NDP kinase. We have recently partially purified a 43 kDa protein from bovine brain membranes that is phosphorylated by rat liver NDP kinase and by recombinant human nm23-H1. This protein is not phosphorylated when incubated with either ATP or GTP in the absence of added NDP kinase. Our results indicate that the phosphate is transferred from the catalytic histidines of these NDP kinases to an aspartate or glutamate residue on the 43 kDa protein. The phosphorylation of aspartate or glutamate residues by NDP kinase is analogous to phosphorylation reactions carried out by two-component histidine kinases. Two-component histidine kinases are involved in a number of cell signaling pathways in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These kinases autophosphorylate on a histidine and then transfer the phosphate to an aspartate on the same or different protein. This \"two-component\" protein kinase like activity of nm23-H1 appears to correlate with its ability to inhibit the motility of human breast carcinoma cells. We are in the processes of identifying the 43 kDa protein phosphorylated by nm23 and characterizing the mechanism of this phosphate transfer reaction. ',\n",
       " 'Plasmid prophage P1 is one of the simplest genomes that enjoys segregational stability as a consequence of (a) controlled replication, (b) a partition mechanism, and (c) a fail-safe mechanism that can kill cells from which this non-essential genome has been lost. (a). The effective binding of the replication initiator protein RepA of plasmid P1 to the origin it activates is controlled by chaperones. They can play a role in vitro of converting the inert dimeric form of RepA into active monomers. Physical measurements previously suggested that in vivo chaperones assist monomerization indirectly by mediating a conformational change in a predominantly monomeric form of RepA. Support for this view comes from studies of mutants defective in RepA dimerization that are found to retain chaperone-dependence for DNA binding. We are also interested in the role of RepA in strand-opening. In vivo studies indicate that the role of RepA is to assist strand-opening (as detected by reactivity of the DNA with permanganate) by the host initiator DnaA. (b) P1 contributes two proteins, ParA and ParB, and a centromere analog, parS, to a partition apparatus. A novel selection for partition-defective mutants that exploits a dysfunctional interaction between ParB and parS was previously developed. A characterization of ParB mutants thus obtained indicates that a C-terminal region of the protein is required for dimerization and binding to parS. Evidence that a +1 ribosomal frameshift in a particular mutant can partially compensate for a -1 frameshift in a particular mutant resolves an apparent inconsistency in the analysis. The dysfunctional ParB-parS interaction mentioned above may possibly involve a polymerization of ParB along the DNA from a nucleation site in parS such that the covered DNA is silenced. Conditions for testing this hypothesis are being developed. (c) P1 encodes an endotoxin (Doc) that can cause death on curing a host of its plasmid and an antidote (Phd) that prevents host death during plasmid maintenance. The relative instability of the antidote means that the cessation of transcription of the phd-doc operon can be lethal. Fluctuations in transcription of the operon are damped by an autoregulatory circuit in which both Phd and Doc participate. Mutants in phd and doc that affect specific separable functions have been isolated. ',\n",
       " 'Our research examines the molecular mechanism of recombination and DNA damage repair in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our primary focus is on meiotic recombination, but we also study events that occur during vegetative growth. Current research involves three aspects of these complex biological processes: Initiation of meiotic recombination: Meiotic recombination is initiated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs); both the location and timing of break formation is tightly controlled. Our aim is to determine the proteins that form DSBs, their substrate requirements, and the factors that control their location, frequency and timing. Current research is directed at determining the composition of the protein complex that catalyzes DSB formation and at determining the chromosome structural elements that determine where DSBs do and do not form. Mechanism of meiotic recombination: We have developed techniques to isolate and characterize unstable intermediates in meiotic recombination, and have used these techniques to demonstrate that the two classes of meiotic recombination (events associated with crossing-over versus events not accompanied by crossing-over) proceed by distinct molecular mechanisms. Our current aim is to determine the repair proteins that participate in both pathways, that are unique to one or the other pathway, and that determine the choice between crossover and noncrossover recombination. Chromatin modification and double-strand break repair: We are examining changes in chromatin structure and modification that occur in response to DNA double-strand breaks, using as a model system a single DSB formed by the HO endonuclease in vegetative cells. We have shown that a large region of chromatin (> 40 kb) is modified, by phosphorylation of histone H2A, in response to this defined DSB. Current research is aimed at determining the proteins responsible for this DSB-associated chromatin modification and remodeling, and at examining similar events in meiosis.',\n",
       " 'The overall direction of the Molecular Mechanisms of Tumor Promotion Section is to elucidate the mechanisms of action of the phorbol esters and their endogenous analog, the lipophilic second messenger sn-1,2-diacylglycerol. Protein kinase C (PKC) is the major receptor for these compounds, and our emphasis is correspondingly directed at this family of isozymes. In a collaborative effort, we seek to combine mutational analysis with computer modeling and chemical synthesis to probe ligand - PKC interactions. An important concept to emerge is that different ligands interact through a combination of common and unique contacts. A related issue is the significance of twin phorbol ester binding domains in typical PKCs. By mutating the individual binding domains, we find that the two binding domains of PKC delta are not equivalent; rather, the second domain plays the predominant role in translocation of PKC to the membrane in the presence of phorbol ester. For PKC alpha, in contrast, occupancy of both domains appears essential for translocation, and the rate of translocation depends on the binding affinities of the two domains. Our long term objective is to exploit such isotype differences to dissect subpathways of PKC mediated signal transduction. The bryostatins, although activators of PKC in vitro, function as partial antagonists in intact cells. Consistent with their possessing additional sites of action other than PKC, we find that growth inhibition of B16 melanoma cells by bryostatin 1 does not depend on PKC; rather, derivatives modified to bind PKC only weakly still maintain their growth inhibitory activity. The phorbol-related diterpene resiniferatoxin acts as an ultrapotent analog of capsaicin and has permitted characterization of specific capsaicin receptors. We are now able to define distinct receptor subclasses with distinct functions. In particular, the resiniferatoxin selective subclass is involved in desensitization whereas the capsaicin selective subclass is involved in acute responses. These two subclasses, furthermore, use different signaling pathways. These findings have important implications for the therapeutic development of vanilloids in the treatment of pain. ',\n",
       " 'C EBP is a member of the bZIP class of transcription factors and has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes involving gluconeogenesis. We are interested in unraveling its role in fat differentiation but \"knock out\" mice die soon after birth. To examine C EBP function in fat, we have expressed a dominant negative (D-N) to C EBP under the control of a fat specific promoter. Analysis of these mice is presently under way but initial examination indicates the mice have no fat. To create a D-N to C EBP, we replaced the normal basic region with a designed acidic region that forms a coiled coil with the basic region and stabilizes the complex 1,000 fold. This D-N prevents DNA binding in an equimolar fashion and the inhibition of C EBP transactivation is dependent on both the C EBP leucine zipper and the acidic extension. This general strategy can be shown to work for all the bZip and bHLHZip proteins we have examined including the oncogenes Fos Jun and Myc Max. These studies indicate we are able to inhibit DNA binding of both classes of transcription factors in a dimerization dependent fashion. We are presently using the tetracycline induceable system to regulate the expression of the C EBP dominant negative in a differentiating fat cell line and in transgenic mice. ',\n",
       " 'During development of multi-cellular organisms, each cell integrates various signals from neighboring cells in order to achieve the correct gene regulation required for its differential function as part of the whole. One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is their failure to respond to signals from neighboring cells, which tell them to cease going forth and multiplying. Ultimately, all of the signals are integrated at the level of transcription. Since most developmentally regulated transcription occurs through RNA polymerase II, we have focused our efforts towards understanding the function of RNA polymerase II and its regulation by sequence-specific transcription factors and signal transduction pathways. Our approach is to study the developmental regulation of the basal transcription machinery. We have isolated mutations in RNA polymerase II subunits and genetically interacting mutations, which identify proteins that interact directly with RNA polymerase II. We have also isolated mutations in two sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors, dTcf and hsf, which disrupt developmental pathways that regulate the functioning of RNA polymerase II. Our genetic, biochemical and developmental analyses of these mutations will elucidate how cell-cell signaling is integrated to affect transcription of specific target genes. Many of the mutations we induced in the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II disrupt development in very specific ways, which was not expected for mutations in a general transcription factor. The most common developmental effect is hypertrophy of the nervous system. In addition, some RNA polymerase II mutations cause homeotic transformations whereby one structure or segment of the fly is transformed into another. To further characterize RNA polymerase II function in vivo, we have also developed and utilized a technique to isolate rare second site gene- and allele-specific suppressors and enhancers that modify RNA polymerase II mutant phenotypes. My research group has analyzed suppressor mutations of 4 different mutant alleles of RNA polymerase II. The interacting mutations identify specific domains in RNA polymerase II. For example, a mutation in the conserved F region of the largest subunit is suppressed by other mutations in F or by mutations in the second largest subunit in its conserved regions E-F. No other regions of polymerase subunits were identified. The original mutation is defective in elongation or termination and the suppressor mutations also affect this step in transcription. These results suggest that the identified domains are critical for elongation and or termination. In addition, we have identified a new gene that interacts with these same mutations but does not map near a known subunit of RNA polymerase II. We are cloning this gene and suggest it may be an elongation or termination factor for RNA polymerase II. My research group has identified a mutation in the gene, prospero, which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor required for embryonic nervous system development. The subcellular distribution of Prospero protein is dynamically regulated during development, first appearing in neuroblasts where it is cortically localized and then entering the nucleus of daughter ganglion mother cells. The mutation we identified results in a 30 amino acid truncation of the conserved C-terminal \"Prospero domain\". Molecular dissection of the homeo and Prospero domains has demonstrated that they include two independently functioning nuclear export signals, one of which is sensitive to the drug leptomycin B, indicating that export is mediated through the Exportin pathway. The homeo and Prospero domains also include a nuclear export signal mask. Mutation of the mask results in constitutive cytoplasmic localization of the protein in embryos and tissue culture cells. We conclude that controlled nuclear export is a key regulatory mechanism in Prospero function in all higher eukaryotes. We have identified mutations in the Drosophila ortholog of the vertebrate transcription factors Tcf Lef (T cell factor lymphocte enhancer binding protein). Initially, Tcf and Lef had been identified by their differential expression and DNA binding during T cell and B cell differentiation. However, elevated levels of Tcf b-catenin are also observed in human colon cancer and melanoma. We collaborated in the cloning of dTcf from Drosophila and demonstrated that it is the effector of wingless signaling in vivo. These results suggest that dTcf can be used to identify developmental targets and mis-expressed genes responsible for cancer. We have also identified a direct target of dTCF regulation, decapentaplegic (dpp), which is an ortholog of transforming growth factor b. We showed that two dTCF binding sites in dpp are required for repression of the gene in vivo. These results suggest that derepression by wingless WNT signaling might be as important as activation in regulating development. A similar mechanism may also play an important role in human cancers.',\n",

       " 'A striking feature of development in the Drosophila eye is the simultaneous synchronization of cell-cycle progression in G1 and the onset of pattern formation mediated by intercellular signaling molecules. rux mutants fail to arrest in G1, and instead all cells re-enter S phase precociously, resulting in defects in differentiation and cell fate determination . A genetic screen for loci that interact with rux in a dosage-sensitive fashion identified mutations in cyclin A (cycA) as a dominant suppressers of the rux mutant phenotype, suggesting that Rux functions to inhibit CycA expression and or activity. We have shown that Rux physically interacts with CycA via a motif, RXL, that is conserved in a wide array of cyclin kinase inhibitors (CKIs) from yeast to mammals. In addition, Rux contains a C-terminal bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) that is required to target Rux to the nucleus in Drosophila tissue culture cells and in the developing eye. Mutation of the Rux NLS results in cytoplasmic localization of CycA, while in the eye mitosis is blocked and S phase is prolonged relative to wild-type. This suggests that nuclear localization of CycA is necessary for its S G2 functions. Overexpression of Rux can drives CycA into the nucleus, where it is targeted for degradation by the anaphase-promoting complex cyclosome (APC C). Our recent studies of a mutation in the largest subunit of the APC C, shattered (shtd), shows that cells in the mutant fail to arrest in G1 and accumulate CycA in a manner similar to that of rux mutants, consistent with a role for the APC C in regulating this process. Further, Rux itself is destabilized in S phase cells that express the G1 S phase cyclin, Cyclin E (CycE). Rux degradation is dependent on the presence in the protein of four consensus sites for phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases. We have demonstrated that Rux can bind CycE and is phosphorylated by CycE Cdk complexes in vitro. These data support a model whereby Rux-mediated inhibition of CycA in the nucleus is relieved by CycE as cells re-enter S phase, releasing CycA for its S G2 role. Current efforts in the lab are directed towards three overlapping and complementary areas. First, we are characterizing the mechanism by which Rux protein is degraded in S phase cells. We will pursue this directly, through an analysis of the interaction between CycE and Rux in vitro, and through the development of a tissue culture cell system to study CycE-dependent proteolysis of Rux protein. We will also characterize an eye-specific suppresser of the rux mutant phenotype, S(rux)2B, which may play a role in regulating CycE expression and or activity. Second, we have characterized a mutation, shtd, in the largest subunit of the APC C, APC1. We are using the shtd mutation to screen for genes that interact with the APC C. In this manner, we hope to identify genes involved in regulating the APC C during development, as well as targets for APC C activity. Third, we have also identified the signaling molecules Hedgehog (Hh) and Patched (Ptc) as genetically interacting with rux. We are currently characterizing the pathway whereby Hh and Ptc regulate Rux activity. The high degree of conservation of cell cycle components between species makes it likely that many of the pathways for cell cycle regulation during development will be conserved during evolution.',\n",
       " 'This project focuses on the mechanisms of cell transformation by oncogenes which act through the MAP kinase signaling pathway. We had isolated a phenotypic revertant of rat cells transformed by the mos oncogene which is resistant to some, but not all oncogenes, acting through MAP kinase. Using the revertant cells and their transformed parent, we identified a novel gene, DRM, whose expression is down- regulated in transformed cells and whose overexpression in normal cells blocks proliferation. We are currently characterizing drm and its biological function. Cell fractionation studies indicate that DRM is predominantly localized in the nucleus and immunofluorescent microscopy of cells transfected with a construct expressing DRM fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) confirms this localization and indicates tht DRM is concentrated within discrete regions of the nucleus whose number and location vary from cell to cell. Double fluorescent labeling and confocal microscopy indicated DRM did not co-localize to nucleoli or to spliceosomes. Analysis of DRM expression in diploid human fibroblasts indicates that the level of DRM RNA and protein is cell cycle regulated and is increased when cell proliferation is inhibited by serum starvation, contact inhibition or treatment with TGF-beta. When induced to re-enter the cell cycle, arrested cells exhibit a reduction in the level of DRM protein. Conversely, cells induced to overexpress DRM by transient transfection of DRM expression constructs results in accumulation of cells in the G0 G1 phase with a concomitant decrease in the number of cells in the S phase. Our data suggests DRM may act to inhibit cell growth by arresting cells in the G0 G1 phase of the cell cycle. We have also isolated cDNA clones of the murine homolog of DRM and confirmed the high degree of conservation of DRM. Rat and mouse drm show only 1 184 amino acid differences. We have isolated the genomic locus of drm from mice and confirm that, like the rat, the mouse drm is encoded in a single exon containing a 184 amino acid open reading frame. In conjunction with our previous results, our continued analysis of DRM indicates that it represents a novel gene with the ability to alter progression through the cell cycle and may play a critical role in cell growth and differentiation.

       " \"Selenium is an essential micronutrient in the diet of humans and other mammals and is known to have roles in preventing various forms of cancer (e.g., colon, prostate, lung and liver), heart disease and other cardiovascular and muscle disorders. In addition, it serves as an antiviral agent and plays a role in delaying the aging process, in delaying the progression of AIDS in HIV positive patients, in immune function, in mammalian development and in male reproduction. The means by which selenium exerts these many health benefits are poorly understood, but we have proposed that they are due largely to the presence of this element in selenoproteins as the amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec). Our program therefore focuses on the means by which Sec is incorporated into protein and the role of specific selenoproteins in human health and development. Since Sec tRNA is the only known tRNA that governs the expression of an entire class of proteins, the selenoproteins, we have developed several transgenic, knockout, conditional knockout and knockdown cell and mouse lines that perturb Sec tRNA synthesis which in turn perturbs selenoprotein expression as models to better understand selenium and selenoprotein metabolism and their roles in health. This past year, our program has focused on using RNAi technology to knockdown several selenoproteins and other proteins involved in Sec biosynthesis (e.g., SLA, SECp43, PSTK, SPS1 and 2) to elucidate their roles in selenium metabolism and to determine how this element is incorporated into protein. Our group further characterized the roles of SECp43 and SLA in the biosyntheisis of Sec and its incorporation into protein. In addition, we developed a novel assay for studying selenoprotein function that involved knockdown knock-in and are using this technique to study many new parameters of selenoprotein function that could not readily be approached previously. Using loxP-Cre technology, we targeted the removal of selenoprotein expression in mouse liver and then replaced the selenoprotein population either fully or partially with a wild type or two different mutant Sec tRNA transgenes, respectively. The mutant Sec tRNA transgenes involve mutations in the tRNA that prevent the addition of a methyl group, 2'-O-methylribose (designated Um34), at position 37 which is the wobble position of the anticodon. The absence of Um34 results in the loss of expression of stress-related selenoproteins, while the housekeeping selenoproteins are virtually completely expressed. We had shown earlier through rescue of the selenoprotein population in a standard knockout mouse using wild type and mutant transgenes that Um34 was involved in synthesis of stress-related selenoproteins. However, our ability now to target a specific organ or tissue will permit us to focus on the role of selenium and selenoproteins in a given cell type. It should be further noted that this novel regulation of protein expression occurred at the level of translation and manifested a tissue-specific pattern. We are also expanding our targeted knockout of selenoprotein expression in various tissues and organs and have shown unequivocally a role of selenoproteins in development and disease prevention. One of our major focuses in this area over the last year has been on the role of selenoproteins in immune function. We targeted the removal of selenoprotein expression in T-cells and observed about a 50% reduction in the CD8 population and that mIL-13 was enriched more than 55 fold in males and 80 fold in females of knockout mice. IgG2a was increased about two-fold in targeted mice. These studies show thus far that selenoproteins in T-cells are associated with inflammatory allergic immune responses, have an essential role in the development differentiation maturation and function of T-cells and are indespensible factors in determining Th1 vs Th2 responses.\",\n",
       " 'The cytochrome P450s metabolize a wide variety of xenobiotic and endogenous compounds. We apply biochemical, biophysical and computational approaches to examine the structure-function relationships which govern the interactions of P450s with substrates, inhibitors, and membrane components. Since these interactions modulate P450 activity, elucidation of their molecular mechanism will aid in a) clarifying the mechanism of P450 mediated drug and carcinogen metabolism, b) defining the role of individual P450s in the metabolism of endogenous and environmental chemicals and c) development of specific P450 inhibitors. We employed the flash photolysis technique to study the kinetics of CO binding to P450s in a natural biological membrane environment, as a unique probe of P450 conformation dynamics and P450-substrate interactions. The interactions of various drugs and carcinogens with several rat and human P450s were thus assessed, and provided new insights into their modes of binding. Of particular interest is the finding that both P450 1A1, which metabolizes carcinogens, and P450 3A4, which metabolizes a variety of important drugs, are composed of multiple conformers with distinct substrate specificities. This finding provides a basis for P450 recognition of a wide array of structurally diverse substrates. In addition, our results reveal that flavones, a class of dietary phytochemicals, differentially interact with and modulate the activity of specific P450s. We employed computer-aided homology modeling to generate a mammalian P450 model which was used to predict P450 recognition sites for NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase. Synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions on P450 2B1 were prepared and inhibited the P450-reductase interaction. In addition, the substrate binding site of this model was consistent with the known substrate specificity of this P450. This model thus successfully predicts both reductase and substrate binding domains of a mammalian P450. ',\n",
       " \"Childhood cancers are among the leading causes of death in children in developing countries, and incidences of brain cancer and leukemia are increasing for unknown reasons. Identification of hazardous situations and study of underlying mechanisms are carried out for preconception, transplacental, and neonatal exposures, as part of this project. Highlights of work completed or in progress this year include study of effects related to translactational exposure, and transplacental genotoxic and carcinogenic effects of iatrogenic drugs. Breast milk is a major route of exposure to polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The genetics of responsiveness to liver tumor promotion by these chemicals, in particular the role of the Ah receptor, was studied in mice. It was found that a functional receptor was needed for promotion, but other genetic factors also contributed, since dietary PCBs promoted in B6 but not B2D2 F1 mice, while TCDD promoted in the latter but not the former strain. The chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin has been shown to be a transplacental carcinogen in rats and mice, presumed to be due to genotoxic effects through DNA adducts. The latter were at lower levels in fetal vs maternal kidney, liver, and lung, but higher in fetal brain, suggesting particular susceptibility of this fetal tissue to metal-containing carcinogens. Work is also nearing completion on the transplacental carcinogenic effects of the anti-AIDS drug, 3'- azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in mice. Although analysis is not yet complete it is clear that AZT is a genotoxic transplacental carcinogen of considerable potency, causing tumors of skin, liver, and lung. \",\n",
       " 'Exotic species have demonstrated their utility as models for the study of a wide range of hereditary and infectious diseases and physical traits. However, to fully interpret the results of these studies, it is necessary to understand their evolutionary history. This involves not only a more precise description of the phylogenetic relationships among species, but also an assessment of the uniqueness among wild populations and knowledge of historic patterns of gene flow. Our primary animal model has been the domestic cat and their exotic relatives and wild populations. As a crucial step in this process, we have developed the foremost collection of biological samples from captive and wild populations of cats, which has provided the theoretical and conceptual framework for our research. The recently-released whole genome sequence of the domestic cat has provided an important tool for our research and is greatly accelerating the pace of gene discovery and comparative genomic inference. The recently completed description of the evolution of the cat family will also facilitate more detailed study of selection and gene evolution among felid species and populations. Our comparative genomic studies are expanding to include the primate, camelid, and pangolin families. We will complete development of an RH map of the alpaca in 2006 which will facilitate the study of candidate genes for inherited diseases in camelids and related ungulate species, including several related to human disorders. Study of the pangolin, a group of species distributed in Africa and Asia and the closest relatives to carnivores, will provide good models for comparative genomic studies among these increasingly well-studied groups. A comprehensive phylogeny, linked with precise estimates of when and where different groups diverged will greatly enhance our ability to interpret human genetic variation in the context of human evolutionary history. Our research on primates, camelids, pangolins will be increasingly important given the inclusion of both the alpaca and the pangolin on the short list of species for low-coverage, whole-genome-sequencing. Our experience in comparative genomics and infectious disease is also being used to develop and test a model for the screening of animals being trafficed in wildlife trade for disease agents. The increasing contact of humans and domestic animals with wildlife has created conditions that have increased the likelihood of emerging diseases being spread that would have significant health and economic impact.',\n",
       " 'A series of in vivo and in vitro studies has identified a number of cellular genes that play pivotal roles in the infectivity of HIV and in the disease progression of AIDS in infected individuals. One such group of genes includes the chemokines. Chemokines are small heparin-binding proteins that chemoattract monocytes, neutrophils, and T-cells, and serve as mediators of inflammation. It has been shown in the past year and one-half that the receptors for these chemokine ligands are used as co-receptors for HIV, providing the virus a docking port for entry into cells. We are currently carrying out a mutation analysis of all 32 human chemokine genes in a series of clinically well-defined patient cohorts. Five cohorts were assembled by several collaborating units and collectively consist of about 3000 individuals who can be assigned to one of three major clinical categories: exposed, uninfected; rapid progressors; and long-term survivors. We are in the process of designing polymerase chain reaction primers for different regions of all human chemokine genes. The genes are being screened using the single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) procedure on a panel of 144 individuals that are divisible into six subcategories based upon race and clinical disposition. Any SSCP variants appearing at appreciably different frequencies between cohorts will be sequenced and converted into a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay for screening larger numbers of individuals. At the present time, potentially informative polymorphisms have been identified in several genes. One of these genes, SDF-1, has been extensively characterized and appears to delay disease progression in Caucasians. (See Project Z01 BC 10264-01 LGD). ',\n",
       " \"A goal of our research is to characterize genetic organization in the domestic cat and to develop genomic resources facilitating and establishing, Felis catus, as a useful animal model contributing to our understanding of human hereditary disease analogues, neoplasia, genetic factors associated with host response to infectious disease and mammalian genome evolution. In order to map and characterize genes associated with inherited pathologies in the domestic cat which mirror inherited human conditions we have focused on increasing microsatellite density in the genetic map of the cat to increase resolution for mapping of genes associated with inherited and infectious disease. We have completed the third genetic linkage map of the domestic cat, which was generated in a large multi-generational domestic cat pedigree maintained by the Nestle -Purina PetFood Company (n=483 informative meioses). Previous first and second generation maps of the cat were generated in an interspecies pedigree between the domestic cat and the Asian leopard cat. Whereas, this gave us the opportunity to map and integrate Type I (coding loci) and Type II (polymorphic microsatellites) loci, the current map allows us to address whether the hybrid nature of the previous pedigree had an impact on recombination values. The third generation map is composed entirely of microsatellite loci. Approximately 625 loci are ordered in the current map. Linkage groups have been assembled and ordering of loci within the linkage groups is complete. The current map demonstrates considerable improvement over previous maps. All of the cat's 18 autosomes are now spanned by single linkage groups; marker density is more than doubled, providing a 5 cM resolution. There is also greatly expanded cover of the X chromosome, with some 75 microsatellite loci. The pseudoautosomal (PAR) and nonPAR regions of the X-chromosome are spanned by separate linkage groups. Approximately 85% of the markers contained in the genetic linkage map are also mapped in the most current radiation hybrid (RH) map of the cat. This provides critical reference and integration with coding (Type I) loci. Whereas the third generation map is composed entirely of microsatellite loci, the access to extended genomic regions flanking the repeat motif, enabled by the recent cat 2X whole genome sequence,, and the whole genome sequence (WGS) of the dog have enabled us to obtain identifiable orthologues in the canine and human genome sequences for over 95% of the microsatellites. Essentially, practically every microsatellite acts as a 'virtual' Type 1 locus. Combined with the cat RH map, these genomic tools provide us with the comparative reference to other mammalian genomes which is critical for linkage and association mapping. 1. Mapping and Characterization of Genes Associated with Inherited Disease Pathology in Cat Pedigrees with Homology to Human Hereditary Disease: Autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous and progressive degenerative disorder of the retina, leading usually to severe visual handicap in adulthood. Our collaborator, Dr. Kristina Narfstrom at the Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine, maintains a colony of Abyssinian cats with progressive retinal atrophy (rdAc), a slowly progressive degeneration process of the rod and cone systems with similarities to classical human RP. The Abyssinian cat has the potential of becoming a new and important animal model in the study of hereditary visual cell disease processes. Linkage mapping and sequence analysis of retinally expressed genes identified a splice junction mutation which introduces a premature stop codon in CEP290, a gene recently implicated in retinal degeneration in human Joubert syndrome and Leber's congenital ameurosis (LCA), a frequent cause of human retinal atrophy. The cat model provides an important model of mutation in a primary ciliary protein gene, which have gained attention recently due to their implication in human hereditary disease (polycystic kidney disease, retinitis pigmentosa and recently kidney cancer). The cat model will be important in both functional studies and as a gene therapy model. 2. Four Independent Mutations in the Feline Fibroblast Growth Factor 5 Gene Determine the Long-Haired Phenotype in Domestic Cats. The hair follicle provides a uniquely mammalian model in which to study the complex genetic regulation between stem and stromal cells during self-renewal and terminal differentiation of a tissue. Genetic modulation of the hair follicle cycle can affect hair length, providing a rapid means for significant phenotypic change under either artificial or natural selection. A linkage scan in the Nestle-Purina pedigree, which is segregating for the long hair phenotype, demonstrated significant linkage to a genomic region flanking a strong candidate gene for the long hair phenotype, fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5). Sequence analyses of FGF5 in a survey of unrelated cats from 14 short and 12 long-haired breeds revealed 4 separate mutations predicted to disrupt the biological activity of the FGF5 protein. Pedigree analyses of 2 colonies of non-breed cats containing both short and long-haired individuals demonstrated that different combinations of paired mutant FGF5 alleles segregated with the long-haired phenotype in an autosomal recessive manner. Association analyses of over 350 genotyped breed and non-breed cats were consistent with mutations in the FGF5 gene causing the long-haired phenotype in an autosomal recessive manner. 3. Completion of a Population Genetic Database of Domestic Cat Breeds to be Utilized in a Domestic Cat Short Tandem Repeat (STR) Forensic Typing System and validation of the STR typing system. Under support from the National Institutes of Justice, we have completed the development of a microsatellite forensic typing system and genetic database of cat breeds for genetic individualization of cat specimens. A robust multiplex amplification protocol has been validated and genotyped in a panel of 1040 cats representing 38 recognized breeds in the United States. The multiplex demonstrates high discriminating power in cat breeds, exhibiting average locus heterozygosity across the 38 breeds of 0.71. We have determined that the high incidence of null alleles which we observed for one of the loci in cat breeds of Southeast Asian origin is due to a deletion in a primer site. 4. Assessment of Patterns of Molecular Genetic Variation Among Cat Breeds. Genetic variation in cat breeds was assessed utilizing a panel of STR loci genotyped in 38 cat breeds, and 284 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 24 breeds. Population structure in cat breeds generally reflects their recent ancestry and absence of strong breed barriers between some breeds. There is a wide range in the robustness of population definition. Most of the variation in cat breeds was observed within a breed population (83.7%), versus 16.3% of the variation observed between populations. An understanding of the relationship of cat breeds is important in future studies of hereditary disease to determine the likelihood that the causative mechanisms of similar pathologies may be common by descent in related breeds.\",\n",
       " 'Most wild species of cats produce mis-shapened sperm cells in their semen, a condition called teratospermia. We are interested in both the cause and significance of this finding. Male cats that ejaculate many sperm with abnormal shapes also produce normal appearing sperm cells that often cannot fertilize eggs. New studies have discovered that the defects occur at the subcellular level. These sperm have problems in undergoing capacitation and the acrosome reaction, two important processes that are necessary for fertilization to occur. Sperm from these males also have problems undergoing the necessary changes to proteins on the sperm head that allow them to bind and penetrate eggs. These findings are important for several reasons. They allow us to identify the precise sites of infertility, so we can develop methods to circumvent such problems. This past year we developed a technique, \"intracytoplasmic sperm injection,\" to place sperm from teratospermic males directly into the egg using a micropipette injection system. These sperm still have problems completing fertilization. These males have inherent defects that present serious challenges to effective reproduction. An important reason to continue such studies is that men also tend to produce many abnormal sperm. It may well be that what we learn from the cats will provide new clues about solving human infertility problems. Our most recent discovery is that sperm DNA from teratospermic cats appears to be unstable, a problem that may occur as the sperm are growing and maturing in the testis. Studies are in progress to measure the amount of protamines in male cats that produce mostly normal versus abnormal sperm. The hope is that we can better understand this condition and perhaps develop a treatment. Our laboratory has long promoted genome resource banking, the organized collection, storage and use of sperm, embryos, tissues, blood products and DNA. We especially are interested in developing methods that would allow the better management of endangered cat species using artificial insemination with cryopreserved sperm. Currently only about 30% of cat sperm survive freezing and storage in liquid nitrogen. Solving this problem is not simple because successful cryopreservation requires a thorough understanding of the optimal medium and cryoprotectant and the ideal rate to cool, freeze and thaw sperm. We are reassessing and modifying existing technology. Male cats that ejaculated the most mis-shapened sperm suffered the most damage during cooling, revealing yet another disadvantage for males suffering from teratospermia. Damage could be reduced, however, if the rate of sperm cooling was slowed. Studies in progress focus on the thermal properties of the sperm membrane. We believe that understanding the plasma membrane is a logical first step to eventually improving our technical ability to fully protect sperm during the stresses of freezing and thawing. To be successful, artificial insemination must be performed at the appropriate time during a female cat\\'s cycle. The ovaries need to be quiescent before hormones are injected to stimulate ovulation. In an effort to suppress the ovaries before giving hormonal therapy, we are testing the usefulness of the pineal hormone, melatonin. Once \"shut- down\" by melatonin, the ovary should respond more effectively to hormone treatments used to stimulate the follicles to grow and ovulate. A study was conducted to determine how much oral melatonin to give by gelatin capsule. Oral melatonin at 30 mg day suppressed follicle activity and cats quickly returned to estrus within a couple of weeks after treatment was stopped. Our eventual objective is to develop a safe and reliable treatment that will increase the success of using artificial insemination in endangered cats. In vitro fertilization and embryo transfer could be useful for assisting in the genetic management of endangered cat populations. However, so far, pregnancy success has been low using these techniques. We believe this is because the embryos are poor quality or the uterine environment is not ideal in the host mother. For embryo transfer, the recipients usually are treated with the two hormones, eCG to induce follicles to grow on the ovary, and hCG to produce ovulation. In a recent study, the endocrinology and uterine histology of domestic cats treated with several different hormone treatments was evaluated. Females treated with the usual eCG-hCG treatment frequently experienced abnormal characteristics. However, cats that were in natural heat and induced to ovulate with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) had a much more normal maternal environment. We evaluated the suitability of cats treated with GnRH as recipients to nurture embryos produced by in vitro fertilization. Compared to embryos that were cultured in the laboratory, embryos placed into GnRH-treated cats developed well in the uterus. Half of these cats became pregnant with more than half the embryos surviving to implant into the uterus. This was a much higher rate of success than we have achieved previously. Our findings indicate that most embryos produced by in vitro fertilization are normal and can develop after transfer to the recipient. Studies in progress are assessing the ability of GnRH-treated recipients to carry these implanted embryos to term and result in healthy young. We have also been exploring techniques that might eventually allow the production of genetically identical cats. Such animals would be especially important in the study of certain infectious viruses which can kill both domestic and endangered cat species. Methods have been tested to mechanically bisect cat embryos. But, an efficient procedure seems to involve the chemical disruption of the individual cells comprising the embryo. Once loosened from the embryo, these cells appear able to grow into separate embryos in the laboratory; genetic clones. Future studies will focus on growing these embryos to later stages of development before attempting embryo transfer. By having identical embryos we also predict the more rapid development of better methods for culturing embryos before they are transferred to surrogate mothers. ',\n",
       " 'Important etiological clues may arise from comparison of spectra and frequency of mutations in oncogenes tumor suppressor genes in human and animal tumors. Previously, the systematic evaluation for such gene mutations was hampered by artifact-plagued techniques, and, as a result, our group made significant improvements in the sensitive use of single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), developed an analysis with silver staining of bands, devised a method for distinguishing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) artifact from real mutation using a base-mismatch primer approach, and perfected conditions for extraction of DNA for PCR from formalin-fixed tumors. Applying these advances to several studies of human and rodent tumors has resulted in the following observations: 1. In a comparison of human gastric tumors of 3 histologic types, G to A transitions at CpG sites in p53 predominated in all tumor types, a finding consistent with exposure to nitrosating agents. Mutations in p53 were more common in the intestinal and unclassified types than in the diffuse-type. Furthermore, mutations in diffuse-type tumors were found primarily in the more advanced forms. 2. Previously, we reported a high frequency of transforming K-ras mutations in DMN-OMe-induced rat renal mesenchymal tumors. We have found a highly variant pattern of mutations in these tumors that is more typical of human neoplasms than of chemically induced rodent tumors. We also detected variance even in different regions of the same tumor, a finding reported previously only in human tumors. These observations suggest that use of weak methylating agents such as DMN-OMe may more closely reflect the pathologic process characteristic of human tumors. 3. An examination of the integrity of VHL in chemically induced embryonal or adult-type renal tumors, i.e., sarcomas, nephroblastomas, or cortical epithelial tumors, has failed to detect any base substitutions or small deletions, but the possibility of large deletions in this suppressor gene remains to be examined. 4. In a study of different rat strains, the Rb suppressor gene appears to be expressed at high levels in the kidneys of strains susceptible to nephroblastomas, but at low levels in Fisher rats, in which nephroblastomas cannot be induced. We are currently evaluating various renal tumor types for Rb involvement by expression, deletion, or phosphorylation status. 5. An evaluation of nitroglycerin-induced rat liver tumors has revealed base substitutions in codon 12 of K-ras in 40% of the tumors, and the G to T or A mutations in codon 12 are typical of those caused by NO-releasing agents in bacterial systems. 6. Fumonisin, a potent fungal toxin and hepatocellular carcinogen, is a major international problem as a contaminant of corn. It has been shown to block cell cycle progression through G1 in normal cells but not transformed cells. This suggests that genetic alterations in molecules responsible for the G1 S transition, e.g., pRb, cyclin D, cdk4, and p16, may be involved in fumonisin-mediated tumorigenesis. Thus far, it appears that cyclin D is overexpressed early in tumor development as well as in liver neoplasms, suggesting that this sequence may act as an oncogene in these tumors. ',\n",
       " 'An urgent need for new antiretroviral compounds has become evident as more people worldwide are exposed to and become infected with HIV. The efficacy of pre- and post-exposure treatment with the antiviral compound (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA) was tested against simian immunodeficiency virus infection of macaques as a model for HIV. PMPA was administered subcutaneously once daily beginning either 48 hours before, 4 hours after, or 24 hours after infection. Treatment continued for 4 weeks, and the virologic, immunologic, and clinical status of the macaques has been monitored. PMPA prevented SIV infection in all macaques without toxicity, whereas all control macaques became infected. This study represents the first description of an antiviral compound that prevents AIDS virus infection when given after exposure to the virus. Currently, post-exposure prophylaxis with AZT against HIV is widely accepted and used in humans despite numerous reports of failure. Post-exposure prophylaxis with PMPA could have a significant impact on preventing HIV infection in health care workers or others accidentally exposed to the virus. Foamy retroviruses have been isolated from numerous mammalian species, they are not known to be associated with any known disease. The proteins of this distinct class of retroviruses have not been characterized; an examination of the DNA sequence data available suggests that these viruses may not contain the zinc finger in the nucleocapsid protein which is ubiquitous in all other retroviruses. The zinc finger consists of a highly conserved array of amino acids which bind zinc; deletions in that array lead to non-infectious virions. We have obtained an isolate of foamy retrovirus from a baboon that replicates to unusually high titers in a variety of fibroblast cell lines. Virus has been produced and is being analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography to determine the amino composition of the viral proteins. The availability of purified viral and protein preparations will also permit screening of human and non-human primate populations for antibodies to these viral proteins and to further examine any possible association with disease.

       " 'Inter-individual variability in human responsiveness to carcinogens, drugs and environmental chemicals may reside in the ability to metabolize these chemicals to detoxified or toxic products. It is necessary to define the role of individual cytochrome P450s in the metabolism of the vast number of compounds to which humans are exposed. The ideal and most precise method for this evaluation is with the use of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies to specific P450s which upon addition to tissue preparations inhibit the metabolism of the substrate. This inhibition defines the amount of metabolism catalyzed by a specific P450. The MAbs are precise reagents which can determine the activity of a single P450 towards a substrate in the presence of the tissue complement of P450s. Initially we have isolated inhibitory monoclonals and some non-inhibitory immunoblotting monoclonals which determine P450 amount to rat, mouse, rabbit and fish P450s. To date we have isolated 16 monoclonal antibodies that are highly specific towards rodent and fish P450s. P450s of rodents and humans may vary significantly in activity. We developed a program to isolate monoclonal antibodies that immunoblot and or inhibit human P450s. This was made possible by the use of cDNAs for P450 expressed from vaccinia or baculovirus vectors. Individual P450s were used either as antigens or for screening the monoclonal antibodies. We have succeeded in isolating seven monoclonal antibodies to five different human cytochrome P450s. These are P450 3A4, 2E1, 1A1 2C8 9, and 2B6. This P450 3A4 metabolizes more than 70-80% of all known drugs, some carcinogens and steroids. The 2E1 metabolizes small molecules of environmental importance. The 1A1 metabolizes polycyclic hydrocarbons and 2C8 9 metabolizes a variety of both drugs and carcinogens. The MAbs that we have isolated are the most powerful tools that determine in-situ the role of each P450 in drug and carcinogen metabolism. The MAb can determine drug-drug interactions, side effects, determine the individual sensitivity to the type of drug and the proper dosage. This work is of considerable importance in drug metabolism, carcinogenesis, and human polymorphisms. ',\n",
       " 'Differentiation of primary mouse keratinocytes in vitro requires an increase in both cytosolic free Ca2+ and endoplastic reticulum bound Ca2+. Inhibitors of protein kinase C prevent Ca2+-induced keratinocyte maturation while PKC activators accelerate terminal differentiation; thus one or more of five isoforms of protein kinase C (alpha, delta, epsilon, eta, zeta) are potential mediators of keratinocyte differentiation. Transfection of highly stable PKCalpha antisense oligonucleotides into primary mouse keratinocytes reduces PKCalpha protein selectively, inhibits PKCalpha kinase activity during Ca2+-induced differentiation, and inhibits induction of the late differentiation markers loricrin, filaggrin, spr-1 and transglutaminase, supporting a role for PKCalpha activation in keratinocyte gene expression. PKCdelta, but not other PKC isoforms, is tyrosine phosphorylated in differentiating cultured mouse keratinocytes and in mouse epidermis. PKCdelta tyrosine phosphorylation requires a functioning EGFR. The EGFR is activated during keratinocyte differentiation as demonstrated by increased cell-associated TGF-alpha, and by tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC in differentiating keratinocytes. In keratinocytes, AP-1 dependent gene expression is modulated by the relative activity of individual members of the Fos family, and selective upregulation of Fra-2 (inhibitory) or c-Fos (activating) is controlled by PKC isoforms. The interaction of the two PKC dependent transcriptional regulatory families AP-1 and CREB is likely to mediate the expression of keratinocyte-specific genes. Skin from mice harboring a targeted disruption of the EGFR was grafted to nude mice and displayed wavy, flattened hair fibers with irregular width and cuticular abnormalities. A marked inflammatory infiltrate engulfed the hair follicles of most EGFR- - grafts at the time wildtype control grafts were entering catagen. EGFR may be required to protect the regressing hair follicle from inflammatory or immune reactions at the time of follicle remodeling in the catagen phase. Cell lines have been established from isolated hair follicle buds or keratinocytes that display lineage specificity when combined with specific dermal cells in vivo. A predetermined cell lineage exists for hair follicle matrix, sebaceous gland and epidermal precursors, and such cells could be used as donors for reconstituting intact skin with genetically modified multi-potential precursor cells.

       " '1) The time-dependent MMTV transcriptional response to liganded GR is complex, with a rapid initial activation phase followed by the irreversible repression of high transcription rates. We have characterized the global response to GR action in mouse cells, identifying 1100 responsive genes. The response of both positively and negatively regulated genes is surprising complex, with activation and repression profiles dramatically varying over time. The examination of nascent transcripts for a subset of these genes indicates at least six classes of gene response (63). 2) Using ChIP-Chip and ChIP-Seq methodologies, we characterized GR regulatory elements throughout the murine genome. While many GR binding sites are found in the immediate vicinity of target promoters, a large set of GR interaction sites are located at great distances from any promoter element. 3) We have characterized the chromatin landscape at local GR interaction events. We find that GR binding to regulatory elements invariably results in local chromatin transitions identified as DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs). While GR can bind to unremodeled nucleosomes in vitro, we report that GR interaction with the chromatin fiber always leads to the local reorganization of nucleosomes, indicating the chromatin remodeling is a universal feature of GR template binding. 4) GR induced chromatin remodeling in model systems has been correlated with Swi Snf action. While a subset of chromatin transitions induced by GR in vivo also require this remodeling system, we find that many nucleosome remodeling events are Swi Snf independent. Furthermore, GR frequently interacts at sites already hypersensitive to DNaseI attack, and these sites can be either Swi Snf dependent or independent. Thus GR can mobilize remodeling systems other than Swi Snf, and can also interact at pre-existing sites of chromatin remodeling. There are four types of GR chromatin interactions, two GR-dependent or -independent groups each comprising subsets either requiring or independent of Swi-Snf action. 5) The local organization of the GR chromatin interaction sites is highly cell specific, and strongly correlated with GR transcriptional response. GR sites linked to promoters that are non-responsive in a given cell type are refractory to GR directed remodeling, and resistant to receptor binding. This leads to the hypothesis that local chromatin structural organization in a given cell type is a major determinant of tissue specific GR action. 6) Long range interactions between GR regulatory sites and target promoters have been discovered and characterized using the ACT modification of chromosome conformation capture (3C) methodology. These interactions suggest that GR binding elements can function partially through a large scale looping mechanism. 7) The potential directed movement of chromosomal loci within mammalian nuclei is an important, although controversial issue in current cell biology. We observed that a fluorescently tagged gene locus moves in real time to localize with cajal bodies in HeLa cells. Furthermore, suppression of actin expression through the use of dominant negative actin mutants suggests a role for this activity in the directed movement. These findings suggest force vectors are present that can direct the movement of specific chromosome elements.',\n",
       " 'Hepatic stem cells are activated after liver damage and have a critical role in tissue homeostasis and repair. Characterization of molecular and cellular events accompanying the expansion and differentiation of liver stem cells is essential for understanding the basic biology of stem cells and for facilitating clinical application of the stem cells. We assessed whether in vitro differentiation of putative hepatic progenitor (rat liver epithelial RLE) cells toward hepatocytic lineage affects the response to TNFalpha-mediated cytotoxicity, a common determinant of liver injury. The data show that 50% of differentiated cells underwent apoptosis after 6 hours of TNFalpha treatment whereas control RLE cells were resistant. Both cell types displayed mitochondrial depolarization and release of cytochrome c but the TNFalpha treatment resulted in activation of caspases 9 and 3 and the execution of apoptosis only in differentiated RLE cells. Apoptotic death was associated with increased ROS production and depletion of glutathione. Antioxidants completely prevented both glutathione depletion and apoptosis induced by TNFalpha in differentiated RLE cells. Conversely, glutathione-depleting agents sensitized control RLE cells to TNFalpha induced apoptosis. In conclusion, efficient antioxidant defense system involving glutathione renders hepatic progenitor cells resistant to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis and acquisition of sensitivity to death stimuli is an implicit feature of the differentiation process.',\n",
       " 'Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Radon Produce Molecular Signatures in Lung Cancers from Nonsmokers. Increasing evidence shows that environmental carcinogens can leave \"fingerprints\" of genetic damage in the p53 tumor suppressor gene within human tumors. These data suggest that specific carcinogens may be linked directly to individual tumors by telltale mutation profiles. Passive smoking has been linked to lung cancer development by several epidemiologic studies, and the Environmental Protection Agency classified secondhand smoke as a Class A carcinogen in December 1992. This project examines human lung tumor tissues from nonsmokers for genetic evidence linking secondhand smoke exposure to mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Specific hypotheses include: (i) Frequency of G:C to T:A transversions with a coding strand bias will correlate with passive smoke exposure. (ii) Susceptibility factors including GSTM1 and CYP1A1 genotypes will modulate the frequency of G:C to T:A transversions. Radon Produces 249met p53 Mutation in Lung Cancers from Uranium. In contrast to our initial report of the p53 mutation spectrum in lung cancer from uranium miners in New Mexico and that of Bartsch et al., Taylor and coworkers observed a mutation hotspot 249met, in lung squamous cell carcinoma but not adenocarcinoma from uranium miners in Colorado. Therefore, we have initiated a study to directly test the above hypothesis by chronically exposing normal human bronchial epithelial cells to a total of 4 Gy dose (equivalent to 1460 working level months) of high linear energy transfer alpha radiation and then using the genotypic mutation assay to determine the p53 mutation frequency. The exposure phase of this study has been completed. Our data indicate that 249met p53 mutations are not induced and that the p53 mutation spectrum is consistent with the spectrum observed by us in the uranium miners from New Mexico. ',\n",
       " \"The papillomaviruses are epitheliotropic small DNA tumor viruses that cause both benign and malignant lesions in humans and animals. These viruses productively infect only squamous epithelia and progression of the viral life cycle is dependent on differentiation of the host cell, the keratinocyte. An oncogenic subset of the human papillomaviruses (including HPV-16, 18, 31, and 33) is associated with the vast majority of cervical cancers as well as squamous cell carcinomas in other locations. The E6 and E7 viral oncogenes interfere with the functions of p53 and pRb, respectively, and thus disrupt regulation of the cell cycle. The role of a third viral oncogene, E5, in the viral life cycle is less well understood. The L1 and L2 ORFs encode the major and minor capsid proteins, respectively. Expression of papillomavirus genes is regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. In the process of studying the post-transcriptional regulation of papillomavirus gene expression, we have developed considerable expertise in RNA processing and in the design and execution of isoform-specific real time QRT-PCR assays. We are continuing to apply this expertise to the analysis of viral and cellular mRNA levels and alternative splicing in collaborations with other investigators. Some of these collaborations are described below. In addition, we are also exploiting HPV alternative splicing to develop novel RNA-based antiviral and anticancer therapies. Post-transcriptional regulation of the papillomavirus L1 and L2 capsid proteins: The late transcription unit of the bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1), including both early and late poly(A) sites, was inserted into a replication defective adenoviral vector to aid in the study of BPV post-transcriptional regulation in keratinocytes. This recombinant vector produces high levels of L1 and L2 mRNAs in 293 cells which complement the replication defect of the adenoviral vector. Interestingly, there is an early to late switch in BPV-1 splice site and poly(A) site usage in concert with the early to late switch of the adenovirus life cycle. Surprisingly, no L1 or L2 protein could be detected in infected cells at 48 hrs post infection. The BPV-1 L1 and L2 mRNAs have a noncoding first exon with four out of frame AUG translation initiation codons. Short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) have been shown to regulate translation initiation in some systems. We therefore mutated the four late leader AUGs in the context of the adenoviral vector and demonstrated that these mutations are sufficient to allow L1 and L2 protein expression. These studies indicate that PV L1 and L2 capsid protein expression is regulated at many post-transcriptional levels including translation initiation. Targeting HPV infected cells using specific trans-splicing: The ideal cancer therapy would kill cancer cells and have no effect on normal cells. The expression of spliced human papillomavirus E6 E7 pre-mRNAs by the vast majority of cervical cancers provides an absolute difference between cancer cells and normal cells that can be exploited for the specific targeting of these cells. Through a CRADA between NCI and Intronn Inc., we are investigating the use of Intronn's Spliceosome Mediated RNA Trans-splicing (SMaRT) Technology to develop a novel RNA-based suicide gene therapy for cervical cancer. SMaRT is a platform technology that has the ability to reprogram genetic information at the mRNA level. SMaRT involves the trans-splicing of a pre-trans-splicing molecule (PTM) to a target pre-mRNA. PTMs are RNAs that are designed to contain an antisense binding domain (AsBD) complementary to a target pre-mRNA and 3' splice elements necessary for efficient and specific trans-splicing. Target specificity is obtained by tethering the PTM to the target pre-mRNA through the AsBD in the PTM. SMaRT can be used to replace or repair 5' exon(s), internal exon(s), and 3' terminal exon(s) and to make chimeric mRNAs. We have previously designed PTMs that target HPV-16 E6 and E7 pre-mRNAs and have used these to study the factors that are important for trans-splicing efficacy. Trans-splicing to both exogenous and endogenous target pre-mRNAs is efficient as long as delivery is efficient and the PTM is highly expressed. We have shown that the amount of trans-spliced product is directly proportional to the amount of target over at least a 300-fold range. This is an important property of SMaRT that is directly relevant to our goal of using this technology for a cancer therapy. We have also confirmed that the AsBD confers both target specificity as well as splice site specificity for a target with multiple exons. Over the past two years we have put considerable effort into the optimization of 5'RACE protocols and used these to assess trans-splicing specificity. Although SMaRT shows considerable target specificity, the vast excess of all other cellular pre-mRNAs over the specific target pre-mRNA leads to significant amounts of non-specific trans-spliced product. We have made a number of changes to the PTM expression vectors, including the splice site region, and assessed the affect of these changes on trans-splicing efficiency and specificity. These studies have improved our ability to rationally design optimal PTM vectors. Finally we are currently designing new combinatorial strategies to improve the overall specificity of a SMaRT-based cancer therapy. Establishment of papillomavirus infection is enhanced by promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) expression:In a collaboration with the Schiller and Lowy labs at the NCI, we have used our expertise in splice-specific real time QRT-PCR to demonstrate that the PML protein is required for efficient expression of spliced papillomavirus mRNAs at early times after infection. Previous studies have suggested that most papillomaviruses enter the host cell via clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis but have not addressed later steps in viral entry. To examine these events, the localization of L2 and packaged DNA was followed after entry of infectious virions or L1 L2 pseudovirions. Confocal microscopic analyses of HeLa cells showed a time-dependent uncoating of capsids in cytoplasmic vesicles and the accumulation of both L2 and viral DNA at distinct nuclear domains identified as nuclear domain 10 (ND10). Both L2 and the pseudogenome had a punctate distribution and localized to ND10 in promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML)-expressing cells, whereas L2 had a diffuse nuclear distribution in PML- - cells. The number of pseudovirus-infected cells was an order of magnitude higher in the PML+ cells compared with the PML- - cells, and viral genome transcription after infection with authentic bovine papillomavirus virions was similarly elevated in PML+ cells. The results identify a role for PML in the enhancement of viral infectivity in the early part of the life cycle. These studies suggest a model in which L2 chaperones the viral genome to ND10 to efficiently initiate viral transcription. cis-Acting and trans-acting modulation of equine infectious anemia virus alternative RNA splicing:In collaboration with the Derse lab at the NCI, we helped design splice-specific real time QRT-PCR assays that were used to study the regulation of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) alternative splicing. EIAV, a lentivirus distantly related to HIV-1, encodes regulatory proteins, EIAV Tat (ETat) and Rev (ERev), from a four-exon mRNA. Exon 3 of the tat rev mRNA contains a 30-nucleotide purine-rich element (PRE) which binds both ERev and SF2 ASF, a member of the SR family of RNA splicing factors. To better understand the role of this element in the regulation of EIAV pre-mRNA splicing, we quantified the effects of mutation or deletion of the PRE on exon 3 splicing in vitro and on alternative splicing in vivo. We also determined the branch point elements upstream of exons 3 and 4\",\n",
       " 'Many inorganics are carcinogenic in exposed human populations while others are suspected of such activity. As carcinogens, inorganics are very hazardous because they are ubiquitous, non-biodegradable, bioaccumulated, and mimic essential elements in biological systems. Human exposure to inorganics is inevitable and defining their mechanisms of action is critical in assessing the nature and extent of the human health hazard posed by such exposure. Arsenic, cadmium and lead are distinct among metal carcinogens because they do not undergo spontaneous redox reactions and the creation of electrophilic species that directly attack DNA is unlikely. Thus, we are actively considering alternative, epigenetic mechanisms for these metals. Indirect mechanisms by which metals induce aberrant gene expression and malignant transformation under study include interactions with regulatory proteins, altered DNA methylation status, interactions with DNA binding proteins or alterations in receptor mediated processes. Basic aspects of site specific sensitivity are also being explored, and with cadmium poor responsiveness of the metallothionein (MT) gene often dictates susceptibility. Site specificity determinants for arsenic are as yet unknown but may be linked to the tissues that most actively methylate this metalloid. We find that during arsenic-induced malignant transformation, DNA becomes hypomethylated, which, in turn, facilitates aberrant oncogene activation, including activation of c-myc and c-met. This is likely due to the consumption of cellular methyl groups in arsenic metabolism which reduces their availability for DNA methyltransferases and consequently reduces activity. On the other hand, transformation by cadmium in vitro is associated with genomic DNA hypermethylation, which can be linked to tumor suppressor gene inactivation. We also find that cadmium can block apoptosis subsequent to DNA damage from direct acting genotoxins, which allows a greater portion of genetically damaged cells to escape normal cell check points and could be an important factor in an epigenetic mechanism of carcinogenesis. Cadmium is also associated with activation of proto-oncogenes in human prostate epithelial cells. Cadmium can also be anti-apoptotic in these cells as well. In addition, recent work from our Section in whole animals indicates that cadmium can induce prostate tumors in the dorsolateral lobe of the rat, a lobe considered analogous to the human organ. Prostate cancer is an important and often deadly human malignancy that has been linked with human exposure to cadmium.',\n",
       " ' To determine whether stem progenitor cells are present in adult mouse thyroid, we focused on Side Population cells. Side Population cells are characterized by their ability to efflux the vital dye Hoechst 33342 when analyzed by flow cytometry, due to expression of the ATP binding cassette (ABC)-dependent transporter ABCG2, and are highly enriched for stem progenitor cell activity. SP cells have been identified in various hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic adult tissues, the latter including the liver, skeletal muscle, lung, kidney, and mammary gland. We previously identified Side Population cells in the adult mouse thyroid at approximately 1% of the total population of cells, which highly express ATP binding cassette (ABC)-dependent transporter ABCG2 and the stem cell marker genes encoding nucleostemin and Oct4, but not thyroid differentiation markers such as thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin, as examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Because of the size of thyroid and the small number of Side Population cells obtainable, we performed partial thyroidectomy on mice in aim to enhance the population of thyroid Side Population cells. This was based on the hypothesis that partial thyroidectomy mimics acute thyroid injury and thyroid stem progenitor cells may be required to actively participate in the regeneration of injured thyroid. Partial thyroidectomized thyroid returned to the original size after two weeks of thyroidectomy. The phenomenon itself is worth noting since thyroid was considered as an organ that does not return to its full size after partial resection. Partial thyroidectomized thyroids were removed after 2 days of the surgery, and were subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The percentage of Side Population cells increased after partial thyroidectomy, suggesting that stem progenitor cells in the Side Population cells may be activated by partial thyroidectomy, resulting in the increased population. We are currently carrying out microarray analysis to determine possible marker genes for Side Population cells as compared with non-Side Population cells and those that increase in their population only after partial thyroidectomy. In order to understand the changes that occur after partial thyroidectomy at the morphological and molecular levels, two-weeks post-partial thyroidectomized thyroids have been subjected to histological analysis, electron microscopy, and laser microdissection, followed by microarray analysis. Cells with clear appearance and or with faintly eosinophilic cytoplasm appeared in partial thyroidectomized thyroids at high levels, which were scarcely observed in normal thyroids. Characterization of these unusual cells and their possible relation to stem progenitor cells is ongoing. ',\n",
       " 'The feline and primate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been studied for an approach to comparative gene organization of multigene clusters in mammals. Sequence diversity and evolutionary history of mammalian MHC class II DRB genes have been studied by phylogenetic analysis of PCR amplified exon 2 region in this genes. These studies argue that (A) feline MHC DRB genes have the following characteristics: (1) 63 polymorphic DRB alleles in 37 domestic cat samples collected worldwide, (2) five phylogenetic clusters or lineages (DRB*1 to DRB*5) originated subsequent to the split of felid and canid groups, (3) some of these clusters (DRB*1, *2, *3, *5) represent at least one DRB locus, (4) recent gene duplication events in each locus, and (5) usages of different DRB loci as polymorphic loci in each feline species; (B) (1) Orangutan MHC DRB genes maintain 69 alleles, (2) Orangutan DRB genes show distinct distribution patterns compared with other hominoid MHC. Seventy percent of orangutan DRB alleles belong equally to three allelic groups, DRB1*08, DRB1*09, DRB3, and only two DRB1*03 and no DRB1*04 alleles, which are dominant groups in humans, were found in orangutan, (3) Twenty percent of orangutan alleles have a high sequence identity to the human DRB6 pseudogene, suggesting unique evolutionary histories of DRB genes in human and orangutan.

       " 'An AIDS vaccine approach combining adenovirus (Ad)-HIV recombinant priming with envelope protein boosting has been pursued. Chimpanzee studies demonstrated long-lasting protection against low- and high-dose HIV challenges without intervening immunizations. Only a minimal number of immunizations were necessary to elicit protective immunity along with antibodies capable of neutralizing primary and lab-adapted isolates. A role for cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in protection against low-dose challenge was also suggested. After boosting and a third re-challenge of the 3 protected chimpanzees with a non-syncytial- inducing primary isolate, one animal was completely protected and a second exhibited a reduced viral burden compared to the naive control. This first demonstration of protection against a heterologous primary isolate is highly encouraging and strongly supports further development of this vaccine approach. Priming of rhesus macaques with an Ad host range mutant-SIV recombinant and boosting with SIV envelope protein elicited humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses. Upon intravaginal SIV challenge, the viral burden was reduced 10 to 100-fold during the acute infection period compared to control macaques. Notably, protection in both these systems was achieved using vaccines based only on the viral envelope. Addition of other viral components should significantly increase protective immunity. Further prime-boost studies in macaques using molecularly attenuated vaccinia SIV recombinants, with or without recombinant- expressed cytokine adjuvants, have shown induction of soluble CD8+ T-cell viral suppressive activity. Pre-challenge levels of this activity were correlated with steady-state plasma viral RNA levels post-intravenous SIV challenge. Moreover, high post-challenge levels correlated with non- progressor status while low levels correlated with rapid disease progression. These findings suggest future vaccine design should include induction of this suppressive activity. AIDS title: Adenovirus and Attenuated Poxvirus Vectors in AIDS Vaccine Development ',\n",
       " 'Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) are a group of human retroviruses with varying abilities to cause pathogenesis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Gene therapy holds great promise as a therapeutic modality for human diseases, including cancer and AIDS. One objective of this project is to develop human retroviral vectors for gene transfer. HIV, especially HIV-2 as a vector, has the distinct advantage of cell tropism for targeted gene delivery and the ability to transduce non-dividing cells, including stem cells. To address the issue of parameters governing expression and packaging, a series of HIV-2-based vectors have been constructed containing long terminal repeats (LTR) for regulated and high level expression: gag sequences for packaging efficiency, neo gene for marker selection, and those containing split genome to minimize helper virus production. Efforts are underway to identify a unique combination of expression vectors and packaging cell lines for efficient gene transfer in human cells. The two HIV virus groups, HIV-1 and HIV-2, differ from each other in many aspects of their natural history and pathogenic potential. Recently, we identified a remarkable difference between the two virus types: that is, HIV-2 can downmodulate HIV-1 without the reciprocal effect of HIV-1 on HIV-2. This is consistent with the notion that HIV-2 may provide protection against HIV-1 infection in populations at risk. This observation also provides added incentive to develop HIV-2 based vectors for gene therapy. Human CD8+ cells have been known to produce HIV suppressive factors whose identity remained unknown until we published our report identifying members of beta chemokines family as the suppressive factors. These observation also helped solve another mystery of HIV: namely, the co-receptors used by HIV for infection of specific target cells. Since chemokines have both chemotaxis and antiviral activities, we are now mapping the functional domain to achieve specificity. ',\n",
       " 'Although cytokinesis is the only visually observable step in cell cycle and thus a number of studies were reported, its molecular mechanisms are still uncertain. To delineate the signaling pathways regulating cytokinesis, we knocked down all candidate signaling molecules singly or in combination using RNA interference. These analyses have established the following signaling pathway of cytokinesis: The initiation of cytokinesis is triggered by the specific interaction of ECT2 with two known central spindle-associated proteins, MKLP1 and MgcRacGAP. This association results in the translocation of ECT2 to the central spindle, and the translocated ECT2 then induces the accumulation of GTP-bound RhoA by guanine nucleotide exchange. The GTP-bound RhoA binds to and activates a Rho target, citron kinase, which in turn phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chain. This phosphorylation induces contraction of the actomyosin contractile ring, leading to cleavage furrow ingression. It would be very interesting to understand how the initiation of cytokinesis is regulated by the cell cycle machinery. One of the well known biochemical events at metaphase-anaphase transition is degradation of cyclin B, a regulatory subunit of Cdk1. When Cdk1 was pharmacologically inhibited in M phase-synchronized cells, these cells exhibited an amazing phenotype: precautious initiation of cytokinesis even without chromosome segregation. Subsequent studies have established that Cdk1 negatively regulates cytokinesis, and inactivation of Cdk1 is sufficient to induce cytokinesis. To examine whether ECT2 is regulated by Cdk1, we examined ECT2 phosphorylation. We found that ECT2 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 at several sites including Thr-412 and Thr-341. Phosphorylation of ECT2 at Thr-412 induces binding of another mitotic kinase Plk1, which appears to activate ECT2 by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of ECT2 at another site, Thr-341, results in a conformational change of ECT2, which can induce the association of ECT2 with its effectors to initiate cytokinesis.',\n",
       " 'I. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been demonstrated to be the major growth factor involved in development of murine plasma cell tumors and human myeloma. Mice in which the IL-6 gene has been inactivated are resistant to tumor induction as evidenced by the failure of tumors to develop following treatment with retroviruses containing raf and myc oncogenes. However, these mice develop tumors when raf is replaced by abl, suggesting that IL-6 independent tumors can be generated either by other oncogene combinations or mutations. We have examined the mechanism by which cytokine independent tumors arise through an analysis of the IL-6 signal transduction pathway. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor leads to activation of a protein cascade resulting in induction of new gene expression and cell growth. The major transcription activating factor in this cascade, designated STAT 3, was evaluated in plasma cell tumors induced by chemical agents or oncogenes including raf myc and abl myc. Results indicate that the IL-6 pathway is inducible in chemical and raf myc tumors, but constitutively activated by abl myc as evidenced by phosphorylation of STAT 3 in either the presence or absence of cytokine. The constitutive activation of cytokine signaling pathways may be a general mechanism by which many oncogenes subvert normal cell growth regulation. II. Studies have continued on the development of a model for human myeloma using mouse plasma cell tumors to evaluate gene therapy approaches to disease treatment. Introduction of the Interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene into plasma cell lines results in varying degrees of rejection associated with individual tumors following re-introduction into animals. Recent experiments employing irradiated, IL-2 secreting cells reveals a significant degree of protection in 2 2 lines following challenge with parental cells suggesting that these cells may be effective in generating an anti-tumor response capable of inducing tumor rejection.

       " 'Xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes are responsible for metabolism and inactivation of all clinically used drugs. They are also involved in the metabolic activation or inactivation of toxins, mutagens and chemical carcinogens. Marked differences in levels of expression of these enzymes have been found in humans and these differences could contribute to interindividual differences in sensitivities to drugs and carcinogens. Variable gene expression could account for some differences in levels of expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. Most of these enzymes are expressed in the liver and their genes are under control of different hepatocyte-enriched transcription factors. Several families of transcription factors are preferentially expressed in the liver and control liver-specific gene expression. Typically, in vitro techniques, including transfections of reporter gene constructs and protein-DNA binding assays, are used to study gene regulation. However, it is difficult to directly demonstrate that the results obtained using in vitro studies actually reflect gene expression in the intact animal. Studies to determine whether hepatocyte-enriched factors are involved in regulating gene expression in vivo can be done by using gene knockouts to disrupt expression of transcription factors and then determine the effects of transcription factor loss on target gene expression. To investigate the role of liver-enriched transcription factors in control of P450 gene expression and expression of other genes involved in liver function, null mice are being produced. In particular, conditional gene disruption is required since embryonic disruption of transcription factor genes frequently results in embryonic lethality or early neonatal death. Conditional-null mice produced using the Cre-loxP method were developed for the transcription factors HNF-1alpha, HNF-4alpha and C EBPalpha. Phenotypes are observed and gene expression patterns determined using Northern blot and Western blot analyses. The data indicate that mice lacking expression of these transcription factors develop severe phenotypes including diabetes, dwarfism, hyperbilirubinemia, hypercholestemia and hypolipidemia. Recent studies are using an novel tamoxifen-actvating Cre to generate temporal-specific gene knockout models to study compensatory mechanisms of gene control in liver.',\n",
       " 'In mammals, a large number of enzymes exist that metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics. Cytochrome P450s are among the most important of these enzymes and they are known to be involved in metabolism of most therapeutically-used agents. The P450s are also critical in the metabolic-activation of promutagens and procarcinogens. P450s known to metabolize xenobiotics are found in the CYP1, CYP2 and CYP3 families. Each of these families consist of two or more subfamilies containing the individual P450 forms. One question that has not been directly addressed is whether P450s are required for chemical carcinogenesis in an intact animal. The fact that P450s can metabolically-activate procarcinogens implies that they are involved in the process of chemical carcinogenesis. However, the only experiments suggestive of a role for P450s in cancer etiology are indirect chemically-induced transformation assays in cell culture, and genetic experiments in mice involving the Ah locus. However, no direct evidence is available to establish that P450s are necessary for carcinogenesis in an intact animal model system. To assess the physiological role, if any, for P450s and their potential contribution to the process of chemical carcinogenesis, P450-null mice were produced. CYP1A2 and CYP2E1-null mice were indistinguishable from mice having the P450s, indicating that they have no critical role in mammalian development or physiological homeostasis. Pharmacokinetic studies using caffeine showed rat CYP1A2 is responsible for metabolism of this drug and that metabolism is rate limiting for its urinary excretion. The CYP2E1-null mice were found to be resistant to the toxicity of acetaminophen and benzene as compared to normal mice indicating that CYP2E1 is the principal P450 involved in-metabolic activation of these chemicals. Carcinogenesis bioassays are currently in progress to determine the role of P450s in the hepatocarcinogenesis of various chemicals including 4-aminobiphenyl, food mutagens and phenacetin. ',\n",
       " \"New models of plasmacytomagenesis in mice have been developed that substantially condense the latent period from 200+ days to 80 days. This potentially permits identifying the precursor cells and, possibly, early stages in the process. Transgenic N18 BALB cAnPt-H-2Ld-hu-IL-6 (IL-6 Tg) heterozygotes at N18 were crossed to heterozygous N6 BALB cAnPt-SV-bclXL (SV-bclXL Tg) to generate IL-6 +,BclXL + double transgenic (dTg) progeny. Ninety-one percent of the mice carrying both transgenes developed plasma cell tumors (PCTs) at a mean age of 89 days. In contrast, 53% of the BALB c (B c)-IL-6 mice developed PCTs at a mean age of 301 days, and 12% of the SV-bclXL mice developed PCTs with a mean age of 433 days. The dTg PCTs developed predominantly in mucosal associated lymphoid tissues, the Peyer's patches (PP), mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and lamina propria of the small intestine. The IL-6 and IL 6+Bc1XL dTg mice developed striking accumulations of plasma cells i.e. plasma cell hyperplasia (PCH) that accumulate in the medullary cords of lymph nodes. The earliest morphological evidence of B-cell accumulation occurs in germinal centers in PP and MLN that become heavily populated by lymphocytes. Emigrants from GCs give rise to proliferating plasmablastic cells that migrate into paracortical and medullary cords. In peripheral lymph nodes the plasma cells become mature by having small nuclear areas as determined by the Image J program. Early PCT tumors develop in the medullary cords of MLN and in the contiguous lamina propria of PP. Further clues on the B cell origin of PCTs have been provided by the antigen binding activities of the monoclonal (myeloma) proteins they produce. About 40% of the PCTs bind to dsDNA and a proportion of these are polyreactive with irrelevant exogenous and endogenous antigens suggesting that B cells with low affinities that enter GCs are more prone to undergoing neoplastic transformation. Expansion of the late B-cell population in GCs leads to the development of C-myc activation chromosomal translocations (CTs). A high percentage of dTg PCTs have t(12;15) CTs. This process may be AID dependent and we are currently attempting to induce PCTs in AID- - mice. Thus far evidence in the literature indicates AID activity ceases in plasma cells , further implicating the GC B- cell populations as the cells in which CTs occur. The molecular basis for IL-6 BclXL cooperation is not established but may be due to a proliferative action of IL-6 on a pre-plasmablast cell that is co-stimulated by available antigens. B-cells with Myc activating CTs are expanded and develop additional mutations or epigenetic changes leading to more autonomous proliferation.\",\n",
       " 'ATP-dependent proteases degrade important regulatory proteins and help dispose of damaged and denatured proteins in the cell. Our research is focused on the specificity and mechanism of action of the Clp and Lon proteases of E. coli and human cells. Sequence analysis of a genomic clone of human LON, which produces an ATP-dependent protease targeted to mitochondria, has located the positions of 16 introns. This information will help in determining structurally distinct regions of Lon and suggests fusion joints for the construction of chimeric Lon proteases. To date, human LON cDNA clones, as well as several chimeras of human and E. coli lon, have proven to be unstable in E. coli, and the protein is poorly expressed and unstable. Other expression systems are being used (Vaccinia) or are under construction (yeast) to provide model systems to test the effects of mutational changes on Lon activity in vivo. In studies in which purified E. coli Lon protease was used to degrade purified CcdA, ATP hydrolysis was shown to be required for disruption of the secondary structure of CcdA, presumably to allow greater ease of entry to the proteolytic active sites. Conditions that stabilize secondary structure, such as functional interaction with other proteins, protect CcdA from degradation. The sequence of E. coli ClpA suggested, and electron micrographs confirmed, that the protein has two ATPase domains, and mutational studies indicated that the C-terminal domain was important for the activation of ClpP. In protease protection assays, addition of ClpP protected the C-terminal but not the N-terminal domain of ClpA, indicating that the C-terminal ATPase domain interacts with ClpP. A novel member of the Clp protease family, ClpYQ, was cloned and the proteins purified. ClpY and ClpQ were isolated separately and could be combined to form a high molecular weight complex with ATP-dependent protein degrading activity. Electron micrographs show that subunits of ClpQ are arranged in the form of a hexagonal ring. In this regard, ClpQ differs strikingly from the heptagonal 20 S proteasome, despite the significant degree of homology between these proteins. Binding of ATP stabilizes an oligomeric form of ClpY which also has a hexagonal structure. Because earlier studies had shown that ClpA is a hexamer and ClpP is a heptamer, it was postulated that asymmetric interactions between subunits may be important during the catalytic cycle. However, the identical six-fold symmetries of ClpY and ClpQ in the ClpYQ complex indicate that a symmetry mismatch is not essential for coupling activity of the ATP-dependent chaperone to that of the proteolytic component.

       " 'Resistance to chemotherapy occurs in cancer cells because of intrinsic or acquired changes in expression of specific proteins. We have studied resistance to natural product chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, Vinca alkaloids, and taxol. In most cases, cells become simultaneously resistant to multiple drugs because of reductions in intracellular drug concentrations. For the natural product drugs, this cross-resistance is frequently due to expression of an energy-dependent drug efflux system (ABC transporter) known as P-glycoprotein (P gp), the product of the MDR 1 or ABCB 1 gene, or to other members of the ABC transporter family. To explore the possibility that other members of the ABC family of transporters may be involved in drug resistance in cancer, we have developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of most of the 48 known ABC transporters; these techniques have been used to correlate expression of novel ABC transporters in cancer cell lines of known drug resistance. Expression of approximately 30 ABC transporters has been shown to correlate with resistance to specific cytotoxic drugs. Transfection of several of these transporters has confirmed that they confer resistance to the drugs detected in the correlation studies. Furthermore, this analysis has revealed that some drugs are more toxic to P-gp-expressing cells than to non-expressors, suggesting a novel approach to treatment of multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancers. Several different chemical classes with this property, including thiosemicarbazides, have been identified. One compound, NSC73306, has been studied in detail and shown to kill P-gp-expressing cells with high specificity by blocking these cells in S phase. Surviving cells do not express P-gp and are sensitive to chemotherapy with natural product drugs such as anthracyclines, paclitaxel and Vinca alkaloids. A quantitative structure activity analysis of NSC73306 analogs has yielded several additional compounds with a similar ability to kill P-gp-expressing cells, but improved solubility properties. Technology enabling a high-throughput screen for new agents that are substrates, inhibitors or specifically kill P-gp-expressing cells has been developed. Studies on the normal function of P-gp suggest that it is involved in normal uptake and distribution of many drugs. Common polymorphic variants of P-gp have been detected, but coding polymorphisms do not appear to alter the drug transport functions of P-gp. However, a synonymous polymorphism (C3435T, no amino acid change) in the setting of a specific P-gp haplotype can affect efficiency of P-gp pumping by altering the rhythm of protein folding and changing substrate and inhibitor interactions with P-gp. This haplotype appears to change mRNA folding, and cause a major translational delay which results in altered conformation of P-gp. Use of the MDR 1 gene as a dominant selectable marker in gene therapy has focused on the development of SV40 as a vector for delivery of MDR 1. Using recombinant SV40 capsid proteins, it is possible to package DNA and RNA in vitro . In particular, siRNA and chemically modified siRNAs can be delivered with high efficiency and at much lower concentrations than are needed for lipofection. Delivery of toxic DNAs, such as Pseudomonas exotoxin cDNA, can be used to target cancers in vitro and in mouse xenoplant models.',\n",
       " 'A co-crystal structure of a minimal core p53 DNA binding domain peptide (p53DBD) complexed with a response element and chemical footprinting, cross- linking and cyclization experiments on the complex between wild- type p53 with the WAF1 response element has allowed the construction of a model of the organization of p53 tetramers bound to the recognition site. Our results have shown that, to relieve steric clashes among the four bound peptides, an overall DNA bend of 50| occurs. We have used circular permutation assays to determine the extend and location of the DNA bend. We have found that there is a direct correlation between the DNA bending angle and the binding affinity of the p53DBD with response elements. Our results suggest that the sequence- dependent structural properties of the DNA modulate the stability of p53DBD nucleoprotein complexes and may have profound effects on the function of wild-type and mutated p53. Damage to DNA produced by ionizing radiations, ultraviolet light, and a variety of chemical mutagens induces several cellular responses including the arrest of cell cycle progression, activation of DNA repair, the induction of specific gene products, and in some circumstances, apoptosis. The mechanisms that detect DNA damage and transmit response signals are being characterized and involve p53 and a family of kinases that phosphorylate p53 and other proteins involved in damage response pathways. We have obtained recent data showing that phosphorylation at specific sites is involved both in inducing the accumulation of p53 protein and in activating its site-specific DNA binding ability. Other phosphorylations modulate interactions between p53 and the transcription apparatus, the mdm2 protein, and the DNA repair proteins. Since the radioactive phosphate used to detect phosphorylation itself induces DNA damage, we have developed polyclonal antibodies that specifically detect p53 only when it is phosphorylated at a particular site. These polyclonal antibodies, while extremely useful, are limited in several ways. We are attempting, therefore, to derive monoclonal cell lines that produce a single antibody protein that recognizes a unique epitope. Recently, we have identified a novel transcript whose expression is induced in response to ionizing radiations in a p53-dependent manner, and that shows homology to a type 2C protein phosphatase. Ectopic expression of this new phosphatase in human cells suppressed colony formation. Our results indicate that some of the p53 functions could be initiated by activation of such signaling pathway(s) through the induction of expression of this novel phosphatase. ',\n",
       " 'Aberrant TGF-beta function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases and it has also suggested that diminished responsiveness to TGF- beta may contribute to the process of malignant transformation. This decreased responsaiveness to TGF-beta could be caused by defects not only in TGF-beta expression of activation but also by defects in the regulation of TGF-beta receptors. We have studied several TGF-beta resistant cell lines in which Southern analysis failed to show gross deletions or rearrangements, yet in which no TGF-beta RII protein or mRNA was produced. This suggested that abnormalities in transcriptional regulation of the RII might also be found to underlie certain instances of escape from TGF-beta mediated growth inhibition. In order to identify potential transcriptional activators of the TGF- beta RII gene, we adapted the yeast one-hybrid system to find proteins that recognize the second positive regulatory element of the TGF-beta RII gene. We isolated a 2.5-kb cDNA clone that encodes a 371 amino acid novel transcription factor from a human placenta cDNA library which belongs to a novel member of the ets transcription factor family. Using constructs of the TGF-beta RII promoter linked to the luciferase gene, we have demonstrated that this transcription factor, ERT, activates transcription of the TGF-beta RII gene. A specific interaction between ERT and the TGF-beta promoter element was also demonstrated using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We also demonstrated that there is a good correlation between expression patterns of TGF-beta RII mRNA and ERT mRNA in human gastric cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that ERT might be a major transcription factor involved in the transcriptional regulation of the TGF-beta RII gene. ',\n",
       " 'The infection of macaques by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) results in many of the characteristics of HIV infection and progression to AIDS in humans, including loss of CD4+ T cells and susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Our studies have used this SIV macaque model to focus on various vaccine approaches. 1. Vaccinia virus recombinant vaccines. Our infectious and pathogenic molecular clone of SIV Mne, obtained from a pig-tailed macaque with AIDS, has been used to construct various recombinant vaccinia viruses that express differing portions of the SIV virus. We previously reported that envelope (gp160)-based vaccines, when used in a recombinant vaccinia virus priming and subunit protein boosting regimen, protected all macaques from infection by the cloned homologous virus. The breadth of this immunity, however, appears to be limited, since approximately half of the immunized animals were infected after challenge by a heterologous SIV. To examine the role of core (gag pol) antigens in inducing or broadening protective immunity, we immunized macaques with either gp160, core antigens, or both antigens formulated as a mixture. Animals immunized with core antigens alone were not protected even against the homologous virus challenge, although the virus load was 100-fold lower than that of control (non-immunized) animals, suggesting an important role for core antigen-specific immune responses in controlling the acute infection. Animals that received both envelope and core antigens were now protected against a heterologous virus challenge, indicating that responses to core antigens contributed to the broadening of protective immunity. Our results argue for the inclusion of multiple antigenic targets in the design of recombinant vaccines against AIDS. 2. Role of cellular antigens in AIDS vaccines. Macaques immunized with uninfected human cells have been shown to be protected from challenge with SIV propagated in human cells. Studies in which macaques were immunized with various cellular antigens and then challenged with SIV grown in the same cells from which the antigens were purified have identified HLA Class II DR 4 as one of the antigens responsible for this protection. Future studies in macaques will address whether the alpha- or the beta- chain of HLA DR is protective, and whether the protection extends to other DR molecules such as DR1. In addition to these xeno-immunizations studies, we are also pursuing similar studies in macaques to examine whether DR is also protective in an allo-immunization setting. ',\n",
       " 'Nuclear export of mRNA is a fundamentally important process that is conserved in evolution. Mature mRNA is exported through the nuclear pores bound to proteins as an RNP-particle. In the cytoplasm, the RNP-complex is disassembled, the mRNA is released for translation and the proteins involved in the export of mRNA are returned to the nucleus utilizing import pathways so that they can participate in another round of mRNA export. We have used fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) as a model system to study the mechanism of how eukaryotic cells export their mRNA out of the nucleus. A variety of experiments suggest that both yeast Mex67 metazoan Tap and Rae1 are involved in the export of mRNA at steps after the maturation of mRNA, including those that link the mRNA-protein complex to the nuclear pore. The identity of many of the soluble factors, including some protein-protein interactions of the Mex67 mediated mRNA export pathway are known. Our studies are designed to identify protein-protein interactions of the Rae1p mediated mRNA export pathway. We have found that the S. pombe homologs of S. cerevisiae Yra1p, Sub2p, Sac3p that function with Mex67 Mtr2 proteins in S. cerevisiae are components of the Rae1p-mediated mRNA export pathway in S. pombe. In S. pombe they are known as Mlo3p, Uap56p and Sac3p respectively. Additionally, Dss1p, the S. pombe homolog of human breast cancer tumor suppressor (BRAC2) cofactor DSS1, is a novel mRNA export factor that functions with Rae1p. By using purified proteins we found that Dss1p, Mlo3p, Uap56p and Rae1p interact in vitro. Importantly, Dss1p and Uap56p appear to act as linkers between Mlo3p and Rae1p. Tap-tagged Dss1 could immunoprecipitate the interacting proteins in vivo confirming the in vitro data. Based on these experiments we have developed a mechanistic model for the essential Rae1p-mediated mRNA export route in S. pombe. In essence, in this model Dss1p and Uap56p could link mRNA to the nuclear pores by bridging Mlo3p to Rae1p.',\n",
       " \"One line of research in my laboratory is related to understanding human T cell leukemia lymphoma virus type 1 (HTLV-1) pathogenesis. HTLV-1 is the only known retrovirus that causes human cancer. Epidemiological, molecular, and biochemical evidence suggests that HTLV-1 persistence in the host is associated with T cell clonal expansion and consequent accumulation of genetic lesions, resulting in leukemia. Thus, the understanding of mechanisms of viral persistence is essential to prevent the occurrence of leukemia. We continued to study the function of the p12I and p30II proteins encoded by the 3' end of the viral genome. We hypothesized that they may play an essential role in viral persistence and pathogenesis. We found that p12I affects proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, and phosphorylation of PLC-gamma1, Vav, and linker for activation of T cells (LAT). Consequently, calcium release and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription are decreased. p12I, like LAT, is located in the lipid rafts and is recruited to the immunological synapse within minutes from TCR ligation. p12I also decreased MHC class I-restricted recognition of targeted cells by cytotoxic T cells. These findings may relate to the immunosuppression and immune evasion observed in HTLV-1 infection. Another exciting new development has been the finding that the p30II protein encoded by the ORF II at the 3' end of the viral genome decreases proviral expression by a novel post-transcriptional mechanism. We found that p30II binds to the doubly spliced Tax Rex mRNA and retains it in the nucleus. As expected, expression of p30II in HTLV-1-infected T cell lines also decreases viral replication by decreasing the level of Tax. A protein (p28II) with similar function is also found in HTLV-2, a virus genetically related to HTLV-1.\",\n",
       " \"A person's genetic background plays an important role in their susceptibility to cancer, disease progression, and response to therapy. Genetic variations can be used as markers to understand complex diseases including cancer and AIDS. Variants in the estrogen receptor gene (ESR1) are associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer, and we are analyzing data from 500,000 SNPs typed in breast cancer cases and controls to identify additional genes.The TRIM5 gene encodes a protein involved in the protection of cells from HIV infection. We have identified regions of the human TRIM5 gene that appear to have undergone selection, perhaps in response to previous infection. Other TRIM family sequences in the human genome also appear to have been infected and may be involved in the protection to infection by other viruses. A cow TRIM5-related gene was identified that plays role in infection from bovine lentivrus sequences. By studying variants in the complement B and C2 (BF, C2) genes we have identified association in this gene in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly and is estimated to effect as many as of 10 million Americans. By examining the genetic variants in the BF and C2 genes significantly protective haplotypes were identified. The complement pathway is important in the response to pathogens causative for cancer. Further study of this important component of the innate immune response could lead to insight into human disease.\",\n",
       " 'Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) causes a rapid, multi-stage erythroleukemia in mice due to expression of its unique envelope glycoprotein. It provides an important model for understanding the molecular changes that result in the hyperplastic, blast crisis and metastatic phases of leukemia and for testing therapeutic strategies to block each stage. Our previous studies demonstrated that during the first stage of SFFV-induced disease, the viral envelope protein, SFFV gp55, forms a complex with the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) and a short form of the receptor tyrosine kinase Stk (sf-Stk), causing constitutive activation of various components of the Epo signal transduction pathway and Epo-independent erythroid cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. We further discovered that co-expression of SFFV gp55 and sf-Stk is sufficient to transform rodent fibroblasts. Our recent studies indicate that sf-Stk expression is required for maintenance of the transformed phenotype of SFFV gp55-expressing fibroblasts, and that PU.1, which is essential for transformation of erythroid cells by SFFV, plays no role in transformation of fibroblasts by SFFV gp55 sf-Stk. We also took advantage of the SFFV gp55 sf-Stk-transformed fibroblasts to examine the activation of signal transduction pathways by SFFV gp55 in the absence of the EpoR. Like SFFV-infected erythroid cells, SFFV gp55 sf-Stk- transformed fibroblasts express high levels of phosphorylated MEK, ERK, PI 3-kinase, Gab1 2, Akt, JNK and STAT3, but unlike virus-infected erythroid cells they fail to express phosphorylated STATs 1 and 5, which may require involvement of the EpoR. In addition, the p38 MAPK stress response is suppressed in the transformed fibroblasts. We further showed that the signal transducing molecules activated in fibroblasts by SFFV-activated sf-Stk can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors to modulate proliferation and or transformation, and that it may be possible to target sf-Stk directly with the flavonoid luteolin. Our results indicate that sf-Stk is a molecular effector of transformation that could be targeted directly or with agents against its downstream signal transducers. We are now extending our studies to determine if the human counterpart of sf-Stk, sf-RON, is activated in any human malignancies. Our data indicates that 13 28 human cancer cell lines examined express sf-RON, with ovarian and prostate cancers showing the highest percentages. We have developed a quantitative RT-PCR assay to detect sf-RON in RNA from ovarian cancer cell lines, with the goal of using this as a high throughput screen for sf-RON in human tumor tissues. Unlike its mouse counterpart sf-Stk, sf-RON does not transform rodent fibroblasts, with or without SFFV gp55. Studies are in progress to determine if blocking sf-RON in human cancer cell lines will their transformed phenotype. In addition to studying the effects of SFFV gp55 on erythroid cell proliferation and differentiation, we also study the second stage of SFFV-induced leukemia for molecular changes associated with transformation and metastasis. Transformation of erythroid cells by SFFV is associated with activation of the transcription factor PU.1 by retroviral integration, and our studies suggest that this results in high expression of the hematopoietic phosphatase SHP-1. This subsequently leads to a specific block in the phosphorylation of STAT1, a transcription factor important for erythroid cell differentiation that is activated by SFFV in the first stage of the disease. We recently demonstrated that SFFV-transformed erythroleukemia cells can also undergo further molecular changes which allow them to metastasize to the bone marrow. Due to their failure to differentiate, they proliferate to such high levels in the bones of the skull and vertebrae that they breech the bone and enter into the meninges of the brain and spinal cord, causing meningeal leukemia associated with hind limb paralysis. Since meningeal leukemia is a common complication of human leukemia, we are developing this as an animal model to study the mechanisms by which leukemic cells metastasize to the central nervous system and to test therapies to block these events. The SFFV-transformed erythroleukemia cells were shown to secrete high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and could preferentially adhere in vitro to fibronectin. Gene prolifing showed changes in expression of genes encoding angiogenic growth factors, oncoproteins and adhesion molecules as well as genes involved in the synthesis or degradation of extracellular matrix components. Excessive and pathological angiogenesis could be seen in the bone marrow of diseased mice compared with controls. Studies are in progress to test anti-angiogenesis drugs as well as other pharmacological agents for their ability to block metastasis of the SFFV transformed erythroleukemia cells to the bone marrow and the development of meningeal leukemia. We have also been using the SFFV-transformed erythroleukemia cell lines to isolate putative leukemic stem cells by growing the cells under hypoxic conditions. We are currently testing several hypoxia-resistant clones for stem cell-like properties PVC-211 murine leukemia virus (MuLV), a variant of an erythroleukemia-inducing retrovirus, causes a rapid neurodegenerative disease when injected into newborn rats. This is an important model for understanding the molecular changes that result in neurodegeneration and for testing therapeutic strategies to block the disease. Our previous studies showed that the envelope protein of PVC-211 MuLV had undergone subtle changes in its receptor binding domain that allow it to enter the central nervous system by efficiently infecting brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC). These changes created a unique heparin-binding domain in the viral envelope protein that may allow the virus to bind strongly to the surface of BCEC via heparin-like molecules, increasing the probability that the virus will bind to its cell surface receptor on these cells and efficiently infect them. Our more recent studies have concentrated on understanding the molecular events that occur after PVC-211 MuLV infects BCEC. We previously showed that virus-infected BCEC express high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the chemokine LIX and show evidence of nitric oxide production. Our recent studies demonstrate that early in the course of the disease, before neuronal damage has occurred, the number of blood vessels increases in the cerebellum and brain stem, the sites of later spongiform neurodegeneration; the vessels in the brain become leaky; and the cerebellum expresses high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting brain hypoxia is occurring. At the same time, microglia in the virus-infected brain become activated and the brain and blood express elevated levels of MIP-1 alpha, a chemokine known to be secreted from activated microglia. Once the pathogenic changes can be detected in the cerebellum of virus-infected rats, one can detect elevated levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which could be responsible for neuronal death. We are also continuing studies using NMR spectroscopy to determine if elevated levels of any potentially neurotoxic brain meta [summary truncated at 7800 characters]',\n",
       " \"Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent and multifaceted bioregulatory agent. This project is aimed at a) finding ways to target NO to specific sites in the body for important research and or therapeutic applications and b) characterizing the possible role of NO as a determinant of cancer risk. a) Advances resulting from our continuing effort to solve important research and clinical problems by exploiting our accumulating knowledge of the chemistry of the NO-releasing diazeniumdiolates (compounds containing the [N(O)NO] functional group) include: (i) design of a diazeniumdiolate prodrug that on systemic administration is selectively metabolized to NO in the liver, protecting that organ from the toxic effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha; (ii) introduction of a diazeniumdiolate that releases NO with a 2-second half-life at physiological pH that on intravenous infusion dilates the pulmonary vasculature without detectable systemic effects, suggesting its use to test the hypothesis that NO delivered selectively to the lung will reduce the risk of metastatic tumor development in that organ; (iii) development of NO-releasing diazeniumdiolate polymers for research on the possible involvement of NO in the mechanism of carcinogenesis by implanted foreign bodies (solid state carcinogenesis). b) In our studies of NO as a potentially genotoxic agent, E. coli that was transformed with DNA treated in vitro with an NO-releasing diazeniumdiolate at a concentration of only 1 muM showed markedly increased mutation frequency, but DNA damage could not be detected in cultured human cells treated with the same compound at a 4000-fold higher concentration. We conclude that NO has inherent DNA-damaging potential but that cellular defenses have evolved to protect the mammalian genome from the possible deleterious effects of this critical bioregulatory agent. We will place particular emphasis during the coming year on designing additional drugs and devices capable of targeting NO release to select tissues for use as research tools and for possible therapeutic benefit. At the same time, we will continue to characterize NO's potential activity as a pro- or anticarcinogen. \",\n",
       " 'Mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium (MALD) is a theoretically powerful, although unproven, approach to mapping genetic variants that are involved in human disease. MALD takes advantage of long-range haplotypes that are generated by gene flow among recently admixed ethnic groups, such as African-Americans and Latinos. Under ideal circumstances, MALD will have more power to detect some genetic variants than other types of genome-wide association study that are carried out among more ethnically homogeneous populations. It will also require 200-500 times fewer markers, providing a significant economic advantage. The MALD approach is now being applied, with results expected in the near future. We determined allele frequencies for 1,913 short tandem repeat (STR) markers in European-derived populations as well as in African Americans. These allele frequencies allowed us to compute several measures of ethnic population frequency differences including composite delta, Fisher information content, and Shannon information content. Two hundred seventy-eight (14.4%) of the STR markers were found to have a Shannon information content value between Europeans and Africans of greater than or equal to 0.2. Only the top 42% of the highly selected single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) MALD map markers equal or exceed this amount. This demonstrates that accurate assessment of allele frequencies for STR markers in genetically distinct ethnic populations represents an efficient method for the identification of MALD markers. Markers selected from the new set of 1,913 STR markers are being merged with the 744 previously reported STR markers to provide an STR-based MALD map that can enhance the SNP-based MALD map.',\n",
       " 'Direct evidence indicates that both Abs and CD8+ T cells contribute to restriction of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication. In the case of CD4+ T cells, however, it has been difficult to ascertain their contribution as they are also the target for viral infection. SIVmac251 infection of macaques is an excellent model whereby to assess these questions. Our lab and others demonstrated that preventive vaccination delays SIV disease in macaques. Cross-sectional studies performed in our infected macaques defined cell-mediated immune response in effector or privileged sites, and prospective studies with optimized T cell vaccines addressed immune correlates of protection from disease. We showed that a combination of DNA and a highly recombinant poxvirus-based SIV vaccine (NYVAC) is superior to NYVAC-SIV alone and that CD8+ central memory T cells (TCM) but not cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) inversely correlate with protection from disease. Importantly, we provided the first evidence that virus-specific CD4+ T cells also inversely correlate with low levels of primary and chronic viremia. Our next studies demonstrated that the breadth of immune response is important and that antigens encoded by nonstructural viral proteins contribute to protection. As preventive vaccination with T cell vaccines ameliorated the virological outcome following viral challenge, we explored strategies to augment virus-specific immune responses in already infected macaques treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). We demonstrated in two independent studies that vaccination of SIV-infected ART-treated macaques with either ALVAC-SIV-based or NYVAC-SIV-based vaccines resulted in better control of viral replication after ART interruption. These studies provide the proof of concept to explore therapeutic vaccination approaches in HIV-1-infected individuals. Over the years, our preclinical data provided proof of principle for the initiation and continuation of human trials. ALVAC-HIV-based vaccine candidates are now in a phase III trial in adults in Thailand and a phase I trial in neonates in Uganda is being prepared. The combination of DNA plus NYVAC-HIV will be tested by EuroVac in healthy volunteers. Lastly, therapeutic phase I and II trials with ALVAC-HIV are ongoing at several sites and I plan to perform a phase I therapeutic trial with NYVAC-HIV in the U.S. The induction of poxvirus-specific immunity limits repeated exposure to these viral vectors. How the quality and extent of the vector-induced cellular immune response integrate with the immune response to the transgene has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we initiated studies in macaques to define the immune responses that limit vaccinia and related poxvirus replication. A surprising byproduct of these studies, highly relevant to the national bioterrorism prevention effort, was the finding that SIV-infected immune-compromised macaques could be vaccinated safely with the smallpox vaccine Dryvax when a highly attenuated poxvirus was used as a prime but nonetheless were not protected against a monkeypox challenge exposure. We demonstrated that Abs alone but not cell-mediated responses conferred protection, and IgM to IgG switching was impaired in conditions of severe CD4+ T cell depletion. These data shed light on the mechanisms of protection of a vaccine that has eradicated a human viral pathogen, and they suggest that, even if HIV-1 immunogens able to induce neutralizing Abs to HIV primary isolates were available, their therapeutic effect in immune-compromised individuals would be limited.',\n",
       " 'Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is associated with two human diseases, adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), and tropical spastic paraparesis HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (TSP HAM). HTLV-I Tax1 is released from infected lymphocytes and functions as an extracellular cytokine to stimulate gene expression in, and proliferation of, uninfected lymphocytes. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) Tax1 induces the activation and nuclear localization of the cellular transcription factor, NF-kappaB. Treatment of cells with calphostin C, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, blocked induction of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity in HTLV-I-transformed C81 cells and Tax1-stimulated murine pre-B cells, suggesting that PKC was an important intermediate in the NF-kappaB induction pathway. It was further demonstrated that Tax1 associates with, and activates, PKC. PKC was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Tax1 sera from Tax1-expressing MT4 extracts and Jurkat extracts in the presence of exogenous Tax1 protein. In addition, Glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-Tax1 protein bound specifically to the alpha, delta and eta PKC isoenzymes synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The addition of Tax1 to in vitro kinase reactions leads to the phosphorylation of Tax1 and an eighteen-fold increase in the autophosphorylation of PKC. Transfection of Jurkat cells with wild-type Tax1 stimulated membrane translocation of PKC. In contrast, Tax1 mutant M22, which fails to stimulate NF-kappaB-dependant transcription, failed to stimulate membrane translocation of PKC. Tax1 did not directly increase PKC phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. Our results are consistent with a model in which Tax1 interacts with PKC and stimulates membrane translocation and triggering of the PKC pathway. Subsequent steps in the PKC cascade likely stimulate phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. NF-kappaB regulates expression of several viral and cellular genes including the HIV LTR, MHC class I and IL-2Ralpha cytokine genes. It has been demonstrated that Rb stimulates binding of the NF-kappaB p50 homodimer. Addition of Rb protein to an in vitro gel shift binding assay stimulated p50 binding greater than ten-fold. Interestingly, by analyzing NF-kappaB-dependent transcription activity in vitro, we demonstrate that Rb suppresses transcriptional activity of p50. Chymotrypsin analysis suggests that Rb induces a conformational change in the NF-kappaB-DNA complex resulting in binding of a transcriptionally inactive complex. Finally, we demonstrate by coimmunoprecipitation analysis that the Rb-p50 complex is present in Jurkat cell extracts. Our results suggest that Rb may play an important role in regulation of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. ',\n",
       " 'TGF-beta-1 is a potent inhibitor of hepatocyte growth both in vivo and in vitro. In this study we analyzed the effects of TGF-beta-1 on both naturally occurring and diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis using single transgenic TGF-beta-1 and double transgenic c-myc TGF-beta- 1 mice in which the expression of both transgenes was targeted to the liver. Hepatocellular tumors developed spontaneously in 59% (10 or 17) of the TGF-beta-1 mice by 16-18 months of age. Coexpression of TGF-beta- 1 and c-myc transgenes in the liver accelerated hepatic tumor growth in both the presence and absence of carcinogenic treatment. Moreover, diethylnitrosamine-initiated tumors in the c-myc TGF-beta-1 mice showed a high rate of malignant conversion associated with a reduced expression or lack of TGF-beta receptor type II. The results suggest that overexpression of TGF-beta-1 may contribute to liver carcinogenesis and that loss of TGF-beta receptor type II transduced inhibitory growth signals and up-regulation of c-myc are critical steps in liver tumor progression.

       " 'A PPAR-humanized mouse line was generated in which the human PPAR (hPPAR) was expressed in the liver by placing the hPPAR cDNA under control of the Tet-Off system of doxycyclin control and designated hPPAR-TetOff. The hPPAR-TetOff and wild-type mice responded to treatment with the potent PPAR ligand Wy-14643 as revealed by the induction of genes encoding peroxisomal and mitochondrial lipid-metabolizing enzymes and lowering of serum lipids. However, only the wild-type mice and not the hPPAR-TetOff mice exhibited hepatocellular proliferation as revealed by hepatomegally, incorporation of bromdeoxyuridine (BrdU) and induction of numerous cell cycle control genes. In addition, the hPPAR-TetOff were resistant to Wy-14,643-induced hepatocarcinogenesis; from 20 mice, only one exhibited a carcinoma after 1 year of Wy-14,643 treatment in contrast to a 100% incidence in the wild-type mouse group. These findings suggest that the species-specific effects of fibrates are likely due to differences in the profile of genes activated by mPPAR versus hPPAR following fibrate treatment. This species-specific regulation of gene expression will dictate whether a fibrate drug or other PPAR ligand exhibits carcinogenic effects on the liver. Role of PPAR in colon carcinogenesis. There are conflicting studies showing the effects of PPAR ligands on growth of colon tumors. To analyze the role of PPAR in colon carcinogenesis, PPAR- + and control PPAR+ + mice were treated with the colon-specific carcinogen azoxymethane. Azoxymethane causes an increase in -catenin levels and a greater incidence of colon cancer in PPAR- + mice treated with azoxymethane. However, mice with preexisting damage to Apc, a regulator of -catenin, develop tumors in a manner insensitive to the status of PPAR. These data show that PPAR can suppress -catenin levels and colon carcinogenesis but only before damage to the APC -catenin pathway. These findings reveal a potentially important use for PPAR ligands as chemopreventative agents in colon cancer.Role of PPAR in other cancers. To determine whether PPAR affects other types of cancers a carcinogenesis bioassay was performed using the initiator 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) administered by oral gavage once a week for 6 weeks and followed for a total of 25 weeks. PPAR- + mice were compared with PPAR+ + littermate controls. PPAR- + mice exhibited increased susceptibility to DMBA-induced total tumors, mammary adenocarcinomas, ovarian granulosa cell carcinomas and mouse skin papillomas. They also showed a decreased overall survival and an increase in malignant tumors and metastatic incidence. These results are the first to demonstrate an increased susceptibility in vivo of PPAR haploinsufficiency to DMBA-mediated carcinogenesis and suggest that PPAR may act as a tumor modifier of skin, ovarian and breast cancers. These data suggest a beneficial role for PPAR-specific ligands in the chemoprevention of mammary, ovarian and skin carcinogenesis.',\n",
       " 'Resistance of tumors to several drugs (Multidrug Resistance, MDR) is a major limitation of cancer chemotherapy. In some tumors MDR is due to the overexpression of the P-glycoprotein (PGP)MDR gene, or the multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP). PGP and MRP are members of a family of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent transporters and have been shown to cause the efflux of a large variety of compounds from the cell. The gene family is known as the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, and its members transport multiple diverse compounds across the membranes of cells and tissues. Human ABC genes are involved in a number of diseases including cystic fibrosis, adrenoleuko-dystrophy, and familial persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. To identify new genes involved in multidrug resistance we have characterized 21 new human ABC genes. The genetic location of each of these genes as well as their expression pattern has been determined. One of these genes, MRP3, is expressed predominantly in the liver. The expression of this gene in a panel of cells used for the screening of 40,000 potential chemotherapeutic families has been assessed. This data provides information on the nature of molecules transported by MRP3. We have cloned a Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of the human MRP gene mrp-1 and determined the expression of the gene in the cells of this nematode. The mrp-1 gene is expressed in several secretory cells in the animal, consistent with the gene playing a role in the removal of toxic compounds. Genetic disruption of the mrp-1 gene demonstrates that it is essential for removal of cadmium, a function of the human MRP gene. This animal model of MRP function should be useful in further understanding the mechanism of action of this drug and heavy metal transporters. ',\n",
       " 'Effective new strategies for the prevention and treatment of cancer will depend upon the detailed understanding of cancer evolution through its progressive stages at both the genomic and molecular levels. Since it is particularly difficult to study such changes in the human population, my laboratory has focused on the application of animal models of mammary and prostate cancer for understanding molecular processes involved in the development of these cancers and the judicious utilization of appropriate models for translational studies. The research efforts of my laboratory have focused on dissecting dynamic changes in genome organization and gene expression that occur during cancer progression in rodent models of mammary and prostate cancer and to use this information to understand how to better prevent or inhibit the oncogenic process. An important aspect of this work is to determine on a molecular level how similar various models are to the human cancers that they are thought to represent. The fundamental premise of our work is that cancer does not result from the dysregulation of a single gene, but rather from multiple, complex coordinated interactions that allow cells to grow and metastasize to a foreign habitat, ultimately killing the patient. In order to begin to decipher such complexity through a systems biology approach, my laboratory utilizes high throughput molecular techniques to amass large datasets that can be used to identify sets of genes whose collective expression correlates to genetic and biologic properties of our experimental systems. Functional testing of candidate genes is subsequently performed to validate the biologic role of particular genes. This process may be iterative.In order to accomplish these goals, I have sought to answer fundamental scientific questions about mammary and prostate cancer models with the ultimate goal of comparing these findings to the human diseases: What genes are dysregulated in cancer compared to normal tissue Does the initiating oncogenic event determine the gene expression signature of a tumor and, if so, what critical distinguishing pathways are represented What are the fundamental molecular differences between tumors that originate through the over-expression of an oncogene, the loss of a suppressor gene, or induction by chemical carcinogens Can this information be utilized to choose appropriate models to answer specific experimental questions Can we identify previously unrecognized genes that may have important functions related to cancer progression, particularly those involved in metastases What improvements in informatics approaches will help to uncover answers to these and other important questions using extremely large datasets Significant progress has been made in each of these areas as described below. My laboratory was the first to publish comprehensive expression array datasets for major mouse models of mammary cancer (1). Analyses have identified common \"cancer genes\" as well as expression signatures related to the initiating oncogenic event leading to the in depth functional study of several genes and the cloning of a novel gene potentially related to tumorigenesis involving her2 neu. Important observations about changes in gene expression during cancer progression have also been made. While genomics provides an important means of validating models, the identification of critical, homologous cancer pathways between species will lead to recognition of important targets for therapy and improved modeling of these cancers in animals. Tumor progression in both the mammary and prostate glands is often associated with a progression from a hormone-responsive to a hormone-independent state (2, 3). In order to understand what hormone-related signaling pathways may be involved in this biologic transition, my laboratory has used expression profiling to define in vivo hormone-responsive genes for both target tissues. The goals of these studies are twofold: First, to determine which hormone-responsive genes and their associated pathways are dysregulated in prostate and mammary cancers and whether this leads to a growth advantage for the tumor cells; and second, to combine this information with publicly available datasets (CGAP, MGAP, SAGE, published array data, etc.) to identify tissue-specific, hormone-independent genes which may be useful for gene targeting to the mammary or prostate epithelium.While understanding mechanisms of oncogenesis should lead to the identification of additional targets for therapy, my laboratory has also pursued complementary approaches to evaluate stage-specific biological responses to compounds that may prevent, inhibit or reduce the burden of mammary cancer (4-13). We have focused these efforts on several classes of preventive agents and compounds that inhibit tumor vascularization. The use of relevant animal models may be particularly well suited to answer experimentally several important questions: How do genetically-engineered mouse models respond to chemopreventive and therapeutic agents and how does this relate to the genetic abnormalities used to develop the tumors Do the agents work in a cancer stage-specific manner Are there agents that target dormant metastatic cells Will the application of high-throughput genomic approaches identify previously unrecognized in vivo mechanisms of action for various compounds that may lead to improved choices for combination therapy Can array approaches help identify mechanisms of resistance to therapy Several long-term studies have been performed testing multiple chemopreventive and anti-angiogenic compounds and have resulted in a range of responses that appear to be stage-specific. Ongoing studies are determining compound-specific gene expression signatures and will lead to rationale combination therapies. Future studies will focus on identifying and testing compounds that prevent or inhibit tumorigenesis in mammary models that incorporate genomic instability as a key feature. In summary, my research program is helping to achieve major objectives of the NCI through our work to understand cancer from a systems biology perspective, identifying genes that are involved in tumor progression and metastases that may serve as important targets for therapy, and advancing the applications of animal models for pre-clinical testing.',\n",
       " 'Increased vascularization associated with tumor progression may either involve up-regulation of angiogenic stimulators or down-regulation of angiogenic inhibitors, or both. New blood vessels are necessary for tumor growth and they also serve as a route for metastatic cells into the systemic circulation. Current work focuses on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its tyrosine kinase receptors, flt-1 and KDR. VEGF expression is significantly increased in human breast carcinomas, whereas other known angiogenic stimulators, including basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factors alpha and beta, are not differentially expressed in malignant and the adjacent non-neoplastic breast tissues. In the same breast samples, expression of the two known VEGF receptors, flt-1 and KDR, is not coordinately increased with the VEGF in the carcinomas. Tumor vasculature presents a potential target for anticancer therapy. Flavone acetic acid (FAA) causes hemorrhagic necrosis in a wide spectrum of transplanted rodent tumors which has been associated with effects on the tumor vasculature. FAA is used in this study as a model compound to search for unique properties of tumor vasculature which can serve as therapeutic targets. FAA treatment of mice with transplanted subcutaneous tumors results in increased tumor cell apoptosis, which is first observed after one hour and occupies 95% of the tumor by 24 hours. There is an indication that the antitumor effects of FAA involve increased nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in the tumors is increased two hours after FAA treatment with a simultaneous increase in the formation of toxic peroxinitrite radical. These findings suggest that the apoptotic pathway is triggered by NO-mediated mechanism. In vitro studies show that FAA stimulates endothelial specific NOS activity and causes G2 M cell cycle arrest in microvascular endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. FAA also blocks angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and endothelial tube formation in Matrigel. The cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects of FAA may contribute to its tumoricidal activity. ',\n",
       " 'Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) is widely distributed in body fluids and interstitial tissues throughout the body. In addition to its role as a regulator of matrix metalloproteinases activity, TIMP-1 is emerging as a protein with diverse functions, including inhibition of angiogenesis and growth promoting activity. We have demonstrated increased TIMP-1 expression in human breast carcinoma samples and an association between high in vitro TIMP-1 production and more malignant phenotypes among human breast carcinoma cell lines. Enhanced tumor growth of TIMP-1 transfected breast carcinoma cells in nude mice was associated with up-regulation of VEGF expression and increased vascularization. This contradicts the angiogenesis inhibitory activity which was observed when TIMP-1 was administered exogenously. Ongoing studies to define the role of TIMP-1 in angiogenesis utilize a tetracycline-regulated gene expression system in which stimulation and suppression of TIMP-1 expression on endothelial capillary formation can be examined. Future studies will also utilize transgenic mice overexpressing TIMP-1. We recently generated several homozygous TIMP-1 transgenic lines, using an albumin promoter for targeting of the liver. The transgenic line with the highest TIMP-1 expression in the liver showed microscopic abnormalities at 4 months with diffuse cytoplasmic clearing of the hepatocytes. This preliminary finding may suggest that the high TIMP-1 production is interfering with normal hepatocyte function. In addition to the importance of this transgenic model in studying the biological effects of TIMP-1 on the liver, the exceptionally high circulating TIMP-1 levels in these mice are advantageous for testing its effects on tumor growth and neovascularization of transplanted tumor cells. Cell lines from these transgenic mice are being established for these studies. The most recent generation of two homozygous MMTV TIMP-1 transgenic lines will provide an important experimental model to help define the role of TIMP-1 in breast cancer development. ',\n",
       " '2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), a carcinogen in cooked meat, was determined to be a mammary gland carcinogen in female Sprague-Dawley rats on a high fat diet. With our protocol, tumors are induced following a 10-dose regimen of PhIP after a short latency period (25 weeks after treatment). The PhIP-induced mammary tumor incidence and mass was shown to be affected by the level of dietary fat given to the rats. A high-fat diet (23.5% corn oil) resulted in a two- to threefold higher incidence and weight of mammary gland cancer than a low fat diet (5% corn oil). To elucidate possible mechanisms of PhIP-induced mammary gland cancer and effect of dietary fat, tumors are being examined for genetic alterations by single strand conformation polymorphisms-polymerase chain reaction (SSCP-PCR) methods, differential display and gene cloning, and DNA sequencing. Tumors are being cultured to establish cell lines for cytogenetic analysis. Two epithelial cell lines have been established so far, and G-banding and chromosomal painting are underway. To date, approximately 50% of tumors have been found to carry mutations codons 12 and 13 of H-ras gene. Dietary fat does not appear to significantly alter the percentage of tumors carrying the H-ras mutations. By differential display, several genes have been shown to be differentially expressed between tumor and normal mammary gland, and gene cloning is currently underway. P53 mutations do not appear to be a feature in PhIP-induced rat mammary gland tumorigenesis, but studies are ongoing to examine p53 expression in mammary gland tumors and normal mammary gland. RT-PCR demonstrated a higher expression of neu in approximately 75% of tumors. The overexpression of neu is not due gene amplification, as shown by southern blot analysis. To date, no mutations in the neu oncogene have been found in PhIP-induced rat mammary tumors. ',\n",
       " 'The oncogene c-myc and transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha are frequently co-expressed in human cancers suggesting that their interaction may be a critical step in malignant growth. Consistent with this idea, we recently demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model that TGF-alpha dramatically enhances c-myc induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis was investigated during neoplastic development in the liver of c-myc and c-myc TGF-alpha transgenic mice. Both lines displayed dramatic increases of mitotic and apoptotic rates before the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but only c-myc TGF-alpha livers showed significant levels of net proliferation (mitosis minus apoptosis). Subsequently, mitosis declined in peritumorous tissues, concomitant with the previously reported induction of TGF-beta-1, whereas c-myc and c-myc TGF-alpha HCCs maintained mitotic hyperactivity. The c-myc TGF-alpha HCCs were also characterized by a particularly strong expression of TGF-alpha and very low apoptotic index in contrast to high levels of apoptosis in peritumorous tissues and c-myc HCCs. Cell proliferation in noncancerous and cancerous tissues correlated with a stronger induction of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein in c-myc TGF-alpha and c-myc HCCs associated with intense pRb hyperphosphorylation. Severe deregulation of G1 S transition was also indicated by the dramatic up-regulation, particularly in the HCCs, of pRb-free E2F1- and E2F2-DP1 transcription factor heterodimers, as assessed by immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry. Increased E2F activity during hepatocarcinogenesis was further indicated by the transcriptional induction of putative E2F target genes involved in cell cycle progression, such as cyclin D1, endogenous c-myc, cyclin A, cdc2 and E2F itself. Cdc2 overexpression and the elevated mitotic indices in the HCCs correlated also with induction of cyclin B steady-state levels. The data suggest that co-expression of c-myc and TGF-alpha leads to selective growth advantage for hepatic (pre)neoplastic cells by disrupting the pRb E2F pathway and by TGF-alpha mediated reduction of apoptosis.

       " 'Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes the transactivating protein Tat, which is essential for virus replication and progression of HIV disease. Tat has multiple domains and consequently the molecular mechanisms by which Tat regulates viral and cellular gene expression are complex. P-TEFb, composed of CDK9 and cyclin T, is a global transcription factor for eukaryotic gene transcription as well as a key factor in HIV Tat transactivation. Brd4 is a mammalian bromodomain protein that binds to acetylated chromatin. In collaboration with Dr. Keiko Ozato, NICHD, we recently reported Brd4 interacts with P-TEFb and plays a major role in P-TEFb regulation. Proteomic analysis revealed that Brd4 interacts with cyclin T1 and Cdk9 that constitutes core positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). P-TEFb is found in two major pools in the cell. The inactive cytoplasmic fraction contains P-TEFb in association with 7SK HEXIM1. Brd4 was found associated with active nuclear P-TEFb. An increase in Brd4 expression led to increased P-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) CTD and stimulation of transcription from promoters in vivo. Conversely, a reduction in Brd4 expression by siRNA reduced CTD phosphorylation and transcription, revealing that Brd4 is a positive regulatory component of P-TEFb. In chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, the recruitment of P-TEFb to a promoter was dependent on Brd4 and was enhanced by an increase in chromatin acetylation. These studies provide important insight into P-TEFb regulation and suggest that P-TEFb alternately interacts with Brd4 and the inhibitory subunit to maintain functional equilibrium in the cell. As pointed out above, the bromodomain protein Brd4 has been shown to interact with the low molecular weight, active P-TEFb complex and recruit P-TEFb to the HIV-1 LTR promoter. The subsequent events through which Brd4 affects CDK9 kinase activity and regulates RNAP II-dependent transcription are not clearly understood. By using a stepwise initiation and elongation complex, our most recent studies provide evidence that Brd4 regulates P-TEFb kinase activity by inducing a negative auto-phosphorylation pathway that regulates transcriptional elongation complexes. Brd4 induces phosphorylation of CDK9 at T29 in the HIV transcription initiation complex. P-TEFb inhibition is transient as Brd4 is released from the transcription complex between +14 and +36. Removal of the phosphate group at T29 by an incoming phosphatase released P-TEFb activity, resulting in increased RNAP II CTD phosphorylation and transcription. Finally, we present evidence by ChIP analysis that T-29 phosphorylated CDK9 is associated with HIV promoter region in the integrated and transcriptionally silent HIV genome. Tat induction of transcription, and release from the latent state, is accompanied by a decrease in T29 phosphorylation. These results suggest that Brd4-induced T29P may play an important step in HIV latency by inhibiting viral transcription.',\n",
       " 'In FY08, we have focused primarily on elucidating the tumor cell-autonomous components of the switch in activity of TGF-beta from tumor suppressor to pro-progression factor. TGF-beta is a potent inhibitor of the proliferation of epithelial cells, and it has been widely assumed that this property is critical for the ability of TGF-beta to function as a tumor suppressor. However, we have identified a novel tumor suppression mechanism that is independent of direct effects on cell proliferation. Using a breast cancer xenograft model, we have shown that endogenous TGF-betas can suppress tumorigenesis by reducing the size of the putative cancer stem cell population and by promoting differentiation of the highly proliferative cancer progenitor cells. Experimental blockade of TGF-beta response in this model system converted the gene expression profile and histology of the tumor from a differentiated luminal to a less differentiated basal state, which previous clinical breast cancer studies have shown to be associated with a poorer prognosis. We identified the transcriptional regulator Id1 as a critical downstream target of TGF-beta in regulating differentiation, and we propose that molecular changes that block differentiation can selectively block this tumor suppressor effect of TGF-beta, thereby contributing to the metastatic switch. The TGF-beta signal is transduced by two structurally highly related proteins, Smad2 and Smad3, as well as by other signaling cascades such as the MAPK kinase and PI3 kinase pathways. We have hypothesized that the balance between these different signaling pathways may be critical in determining whether the output of the TGF-beta signal is tumor suppressive or tumor promoting. To systematically address this question, we have generated a panel of conditionally immortalized mammary epithelial cells from mice of differing Smad genotypes. This approach allows us more precise control over Smad2 3 levels than can be achieved through RNA interference approaches. We have found that the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic responses of the mammary epithelium to TGF-beta require only Smad3 and not Smad2. In contrast, the pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects of TGF-beta require obligatory cooperation between both Smads. The data suggest that Smad3 may be critical for both tumor suppressor and pro-progression responses, while Smad2 is more important for the pro-progression responses. In addition, there are interesting gene dosage effects in the requirement for Smad3, with loss of one allele of Smad3 resulting in loss of the pro-apoptotic response to TGF-beta, while still permitting the other responses. Thus, despite the critical requirement for Smad3 in both tumor suppressive and tumor promoting activities, a reduction in Smad3 is predicted selectively to promote progression. In support of this prediction, we have found that Smad3+ - mice have a higher incidence of metastasis in the MMTV-PVT transgenic mouse model of breast cancer. The potential association between Smad3 polymorphisms and risk of metastatic breast cancer will be investigated. The data from our lab and others implicates Smad3 in both the tumor suppressor and pro-progression effects of TGF-beta on the tumor cell. We hypothesize that genetic or epigenetic changes that occur during cancer progression may alter the Smad3-mediated readout of the TGF-beta signal so that tumor promoting activities dominate. To address this question, we have performed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify Smad3 targets in two closely related cell lines, MCF10Ca1h in which TGF-beta functions as tumor suppressor, and MCF10Ca1a in which TGF-beta functions as a pro-progression factor. Integration of the promoter occupancy data with global gene expression data has yielded core Smad3-based gene signatures that are associated with the two different outcomes. These signatures should yield important insights into mechanisms underlying the switch process, and will be exploited in gene expression based screens to find novel compounds that might reverse the switch and restore the tumor suppressor activities of TGF-beta.',\n",
       " \"2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine is a food-borne mutagen and mammary gland carcinogen in female rats. A high fat diet has been shown to increase the incidence of PhIP-induced mammary gland tumors. We used Big Blue rats harboring the lambda lacI mutational reporter transgene, to address whether the promotional effect of a high fat diet is mediated via modulation in mammary gland mutagenesis. Big Blue rats were given 10 doses of PhIP (75 mg kg, p.o.) and place on defined low fat (5% corn oil) or high fat (23.5% corn oil) diet for 6 weeks prior to collecting mammary glands. The lacI mutant frequency (mean + standard error, n=3 rats) was 231 + 15 (x10-6) and 193 + 12 (x10-6) in the low and high fat group, respectively. Values were increased 12-fold over control but were not significantly different between the two diets. In a parallel study, diet did not alter the mutant frequency induced by 7,12-dimethylbenzaanthracene (DMBA) (125 mg kg, p.o.) in the mammary gland. The findings suggest that the promotion by the high fat diet is not mediated via an increase in mutations. Consistent with the high potency of DMBA as a mammary carcinogen, the mutant frequency was 20-30% higher with DMBA than with PhIP. Sixty-nine and 56 PhIP-induced lacI mutants were sequenced from the low and high fat diet groups, respectively. While the percentage of various types of mutations were identical between the diet groups, some difference in the distribution of mutations along the lacI gene was observed. The mutation spectrum in the mammary gland from rats on both diets was consistent with the formation of PhIP-guanine adducts which were detected by 32P-postlabeling assay. Guanine base substitutions accounted for about 85% of all mutations irrespective of diet. Single base pair deletions at guanine occurred in 11-17% of mutants. G:C to T:A transversions were the predominant base substitution mutation accounting for 35-43% of all mutations. The majority of all guanine mutations (74%) occurred at guanine bases adjacent to another G:C pair. Five out of 125 (4%) mutations involved a G deletion in the 5'-GGGA-3' sequence. Twelve out of 125 (10%) mutations involved the guanine base in the sequence 5'-CAG(Pu)-3'. The findings from these studies suggest that 5'-CAG(Pu)-3' is an characteristic target site for PhIP guanine adduct-induced mutations in vivo in the mammary gland. N-Hydroxy-PhIP is the proximate reactive metabolite of PhIP associated with PhIP-DNA adduct formation and mutagenesis. Whole mammary glands obtained from transgenic C57Bl 6 mice carrying the plasmid-lacZ mutational reporter gene were cultured in defined medium and exposed to various concentrations of N-hydroxy-PhIP for 24 h. At various times after N-hydroxy-PhIP exposure, PhIP-DNA adduct levels were determined by the 32P-postlabeling assay and the lacZ-mutant frequency determined by the positive selection system. Glands were cultured in either medium containing insulin (I medium), necessary for maintenance of the gland, or I medium containing prolactin, aldosterone, and hydrocortisone (IPAH medium) to induce lobuloalveolar development. At 3 and 7 days after exposure to 10 mM N-hydroxy-PhIP, mutant frequency was upwards of 9-fold higher in glands incubated in IPAH medium than in I medium (15.2 + 1.9 and 1.6 + 0.7, (mean + standard error) x 10-3, IPAH and I medium, respectively, 3-day time point). PhIP-DNA adduct levels were 1.7-fold higher in glands cultivated in IPAH medium than in I medium immediately after exposure to 10 mM N-hydroxy-PhIP. A statistically significant reduction in PhIP-DNA adduct levels occurred with time in glands cultivated in IPAH medium but not I medium (one-way analysis of variance, p<0.05). By 7 days after exposure, PhIP-DNA adduct levels were similar in glands cultured in I and IPAH media (3.2 + 0.2 and 2.8 + 0.29 adducts per 107 nucleotides, respectively). DNA synthesis as measured by 3Hthymidine labeling was approximately 2-fold higher in glands culture in IPAH medium than in I medium. The higher mutant frequency in glands cultivated in IPAH medium versus I medium appeared to be due to a combination of higher initial PhIP-DNA adduct levels and a greater fixation of mutations that occurred at higher proliferation rates. The findings indicate that mammotrophic hormones influence the mutagenicity of PhIP in the mammary gland in vitro and emphasize the importance of hormonal milieu on carcinogen-DNA adduct-induced mutations in this organ.\",\n",
       " 'Hepatitis B Virus and DNA Repair We and others have previously reported that p53 can modulate nucleotide excision repair. Using a host reactivation assay, our preliminary data indicate that HBx inhibits reactivation, i.e., repair of the ultraviolet light (UV-C, 254 nm) damage plasmid. This leads to the hypothesis that HBx inhibits p53 binding to XPB or XPD DNA helicases in the basal transcription-nucleotide excision repair complex, TFIIH. We have previously demonstrated that HBx protein inhibits in vitro p53 binding to XPB. HBx binds to XPB. HBx binds to the carboxyl terminus of p53 which also is the site of XPB binding. We are currently investigating the hypothesis that HBx binds to other members of the TFIIH multiprotein complex. We are attempting to obtain crystals of HBVX and co-crystals of its binding partners for fine detail structural analysis. ',\n",
       " 'The carboxy-terminus of p53 can bind to damaged DNA, reanneal complementary single strands of nucleic acids and lead to tetramerization of the p53 protein. Because our data indicate that the carboxy-terminus p53 is also involved in apoptosis, we are using the following complimentary strategies to define a \"death domain\" in this region of p53: (a) microinjection of C-terminal p53 synthetic polypeptides (aa 319-393, 361-393, 319-360) into normal, Li-Fraumeni (041; p53- -) or p53 mutant (missense or p53 null) human tumor cells and determining the frequency of apoptotic cells by DAPI staining and TUNEL assays; (b) penetratin coupling or pegylated tagged synthetic p53 polypeptides listed above, exposure of the cell types listed above and scoring apoptotic cells by DAPI, TUNEL and FACS, i.e., subG1 DNA content assays; (c) microinjection of CMV-driven expression vectors containing human cancer-derived p53 missense and frameshift mutants located in the carboxy-terminus of p53; (d) microinjection of CMV-driven expression vectors containing synthetic p53 mutants of putative phosphorylation sites (366ser, 376ser and 378ser) or deletion mutants (aa1-353, 1-356, 1-363 and 1-370) in the carboxy-terminus of p53. Our preliminary data have narrowed down one important region to be aa363 to aa370. Because Levine and Walker (p53 Workshop, Dundee, 1996) have shown that deletion of the five PXXP, SH3 motif, located in aa62 to aa91 of p53 inhibits its apoptotic activity whereas p53 transcription transaction is not affected, we are microinjecting the aa62 to aa91 polypeptide in normal human fibroblastic and mammary epithelial cells. If the putative cellular protein(s) binding to the SH3 region of p53 is upstream of p53 in its apoptotic pathway, then the polypeptide may block DNA damage induced apoptosis. If the putative p53 binding protein(s) is downstream of p53, the microinjected polypeptide might initiate apoptosis. ',\n",
       " 'The eukaryote genome constantly faces the threat of damage from exogenous and endogenous mutagens. Mammalian cells, therefore, have evolved an intricate network of defenses to maintain genomic stability. p53 is at the crossroads of these defense pathways. We investigate rare genomic instability and or premature aging diseases, e.g., Bloom, Werner, Rothmund-Thomson, and Li-Fraumeni Syndromes, to gain insight into p53 function in the general population. For example, p53 cooperates with the Bloom Syndrome helicase, BLM, and the prorecombinogenic Rad51 during DNA replicative stress to act as a molecular governor of DNA recombination. We have also discovered transcriptional cofactors of p53, i.e., ING2-5, that enhance p53 effector functions in cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and senescence. We plan to continue studying p53-mediated replicative senescence modulated by either ING family proteins or by POT1 and WRN that govern telomere attrition.',\n",
       " 'A new genetic method \"Mapping by Admixture Linkage Disequilibrium\" (MALD) has been proposed and implemented which provides a population and patient cohort-based approach for disease gene identification (Stephens et al., 1994, Amer. J. Hum. Genet. 55:809-824). The method uses genetic markers which have significant allele frequency differences between racial groups and a patient population with a recent history of admixture. A collection of over 200 markers with a 10-centiMorgan systematic spacing and delta values of 30 percent or greater (the largest difference in frequencies between alleles at a locus) has been developed. A group of African-American patients, whose racial group has a history of admixture, is being collected and will be typed for the set of genetic markers. Like traditional linkage studies, additional markers can be used in a region to confirm a positive result and pinpoint the location of a disease gene. ',\n",
       " \"Histone H2AX: DNA's BodyguardMy group is currently focusing on several ramifications of DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation in cellular metabolism. When a DSB is purposely or accidentally introduced into DNA, many molecules of histone H2AX become immediately phosphorylated, thus generating a highly amplified cellular response to DNA DSB formation. The response is easily monitored with the antibody we developed to the phosphorylated H2AX, which is named gamma-H2AX.We have begun in several recent studies to uncover critical roles for histone H2AX. In collaboration with Andre Nussenzweig's group, we targeted the H2AX gene in mice and successfully generated H2AX-null mice. Although viable, the H2AX-null mice are radiation sensitive, growth retarded, and immune deficient, and mutant males were infertile. These pleiotropic phenotypes are associated with chromosomal instability, repair defects, and impaired recruitment of Nbs1, 53bp1, and Brca1, but not Rad51, to irradiation-induced foci. Thus, H2AX is critical for facilitating the assembly of specificDNA-repair complexes on damaged DNA. H2AX-null mice manifest a G2-M checkpoint defect close to that observed in ATM-null cells after exposure to low, but not high, doses of IR. Moreover, H2AX regulates the ability of 53BP1 to efficiently accumulate into IR-induced foci. Thus, H2AX-mediated concentration of 53BP1 at double-strand breaks appears to be essential for the amplification of signals that might otherwise be insufficient to prevent entry of damaged cells into mitosis.H2AX-null male mice are infertile. During meiotic prophase in male mammals, the X and Y chromosomes condense to form a macrochromatin body, termed the sex, or XY, body, within which X- and Y-linked genes are transcriptionally repressed. Gamma-H2AX accumulates in the sex body in a manner independent of meiotic recombination-associated double-strand breaks. In spermatocytes of H2AX-null mice the X and Y chromosomes fail to condense to form a sex body, fail to initiate meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, and exhibit severe defects in meiotic pairing. Moreover, other sex body proteins, including macroH2A1.2 and XMR, do not preferentially localize with the sex chromosomes in the absence of H2AX. Thus, H2AX is required for the chromatin remodeling and associated silencing in male meiosis.H2AX-null p53-null mice develop lymphomas with increased frequencies of clonalnonreciprocal translocations and amplifications, including complex rearrangements that juxtapose the c-myc oncogene to antigen receptor loci. When the H2AX-null mice contain a transgene encoding wild-type H2AX, genomic stability and radiation resistance are restored, but not when the H2AX transgene encodes alanine or glutaminic acid residues at the conserved serine phosphorylation sites. Mice containing only a single H2AX allele exhibit genomic instability and enhanced susceptibility to cancer in the absence of p53, establishing that as genomic caretaker, H2AX requires the function of both gene alleles for optimal protection against tumorigenesis. In collaboration with Carl Barrett's and Nickolai Popescu's laboratories, we showed that DSBs may have a causal role in mammalian ageing. Gamma-H2AX foci accumulate in senescing human cell cultures and in ageing mice, colocalizing with DSB repair factors, but not significantly with telomeres. These cryptogenic gamma-foci remain after repair of radiation-induced gamma-foci, suggesting that they may represent DNA lesions with unrepairable DSBs. Thus, we conclude that accumulation of cryptogenic DSBs may have a causal role in mammalian ageing.Work with yeast has also provided insights into the role of H2AX. Cells maintain genomic stability by the coordination of DNA-damage repair and cell-cycle checkpoint controls. In replicating cells, DNA damage usually activates intra-S-phase checkpoint controls, which are characterized by delayed S-phase progression and increased Rad53 phosphorylation. Budding yeast lacking H2AX are hypersensitive to the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT). The hypersensitivity was found to result from a failure of the intra-S-phase checkpoint controls permitting DNA synthesis to continue at normal rates. However, after replication there is a failure to process full-length chromosomal DNA molecules. H2AX is not epistatic to the RAD24 and RAD9 checkpoint genes, suggesting a non-checkpoint role for H2AX. Thus H2AX is an essential component for the efficient repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) during replication in yeast.\",\n",
       " 'Because most cancers have alterations in the cell cycle checkpoint pathways (p53, pRb) and cell cycle machinery (cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p16), we are exploring inhibitors of cell cycle checkpoints as novel anticancer agents. We are investigating the role of Chk2 in cell cycle checkpoint response in cancer cells. We have expressed Chk2 as a recombinant protein and set up a high throughput screen to discover Chk2 inhibitors (collaboration with Drs. Shoemaker and Scudiero, DTP, NCI). We have discovered a novel family of Chk2 inhibitors, the bis-guanidylhydrazones and shown they act as competitive ATP inhibitors against Chk2. Analogs have been synthesized and selected. Cellular assays are being developed to measure Chk2 inhibition in cells and to determine whether Chk2 inhibitors can be used to synergize with Top1 inhibitors and other currently available chemotherapeutic agents. It is also well established that DNA repair defects predispose to cancers (for instance Xeroderma Pigmentosum and ataxia telangiectasia) and may play an important role in the response of cancers to treatments that target DNA and chromatin. We have set up high-throughput screens for inhibitors of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1), an enzyme of the base excision repair (BER) pathways involved in the repair of topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage. We have identified the first Tdp1 inhibitors, and we are searching for new inhibitors with therapeutic potential. Tdp1 inhibitors should be synergistic in combination with Top1 inhibitors. We are studying several new drugs in preclinical and early clinical development including agents from the NCI-Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP). We are focusing on drugs that alter chromatin and cell cycle progression such as aminoflavone. Aminoflavone is beginning clinical trials and we found that aminoflavone induces replication double-strand breaks and histone H2AX phosphorylation (gamma-H2AX). Hence, gamma-H2AX can be used as a biomarker to monitor aminoflavone activity in tumor samples. Using the NCI 60 cell line database we found that sulfotransferase expression is highly correlated with aminoflavone activity and can be used to select patients who should benefit from aminoflavone. More recently, we found that aminoflavone mediates crosslinking between cytokeratins and RNA. This study suggests the possibility that cytokeratins (which constitute a major component of the cellular microfilament network) could serve as a scaffold for cytoplasmic RNA and potentially for translation. We have continued our studies on the molecular pharmacology of trabectedin, which has recently been approved for the treatment soft tissue sarcomas in Europe. We previously found that trabectedin differs from other clinically used anticancer agents because it forms covalent adducts at specific guanines in the DNA minor groove and because it selectively traps the transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER). We have now found that gamma-H2AX could serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for trabectedin. The activation of gamma-H2AX led us to show that the trapping of TC-NER by trabectedin induces the formation of Mre11- and transcription-dependent DNA double-strand breaks. Our studies on apoptosis are focused on chromatin modifications. We found that one of the early events in apoptosis is the induction of apoptotic Top1-DNA complexes. The apoptotic Top1-DNA complexes are induced by a variety of apoptotic stimuli: arsenic trioxide, etoposide, camptothecin, platinum derivatives, taxol, and vinblastin. Our working hypothesis that these apoptotic Top1-DNA complexes are produced by oxidative lesion of genomic DNA, which trap Top1 bound to chromatin. Apoptotic Top1-DNA complexes in turn activate additional apoptotic responses pathways and might represent an irreversible apoptotic activation loop. To further elucidate the molecular events induced by the apoptotic program, we are focusing on nuclear alterations produced by TRAIL, which is in clinical trials.',\n",
       " 'DNA topoisomerase I and II (top1 and top2) are primary targets for cancer chemotherapy. Topo-isomerase poisons act by stabilizing enzyme-linked DNA breaks which can be detected as protein-associated DNA breaks in drug-treated cells (cleavable complexes). However, topoisomerases exist both in normal and cancer cells, and the mechanism(s) of drug selectivity for cancer cells remain(s) poorly understood. The goal of this project is to elucidate the antitumor mechanisms of topoisomerase poisons, and their selectivity for cancer cells. Secondary targets which are different in cancer cells could be used for drug development in association with topoisomerase inhibitors or other DNA damaging agents. We have studied the human colon and ovarian cancer cell lines from the NCI Anticancer Drug Screen to identify the parameters that are best correlated with cytotoxicity and could be used in the clinic to predict and monitor the response to topoisomerase inhibitors. Top1 protein levels appear comparable among cell lines and thus are not predictive, while top1 cleavable complexes are better correlated with cytotoxicity. Cleavable complexes are, however, not always predictive . Using cells lines with comparable cleavable complexes, we demonstrated the importance of the G2 checkpoint and replicon repair, downstream from the cleavable complexes for cytotoxicity. We have shown that the presence of p53 provides a survival advantage against camptothecin cytotoxicity. This may contribute to the selectivity of camptothecins for cancer cells with p53 mutations. We and others have proposed that apoptosis is a key response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, especially in leukemia cells exposed to topoisomerase inhibitors. We have shown that HL60 cells rapidly upregulate and downregulate cyclin B cdc2 kinase activity before undergoing apoptosis after DNA damage. We have also set up an in vitro cell-free system to study the biochemical pathways of apoptosis. It appears that human leukemia HL60 cells induce a protease cascade including both ICE CED3 and serine proteases in response to DNA damage following camptothecin treatment and that the protease(s) activate(s) preexisting nuclear pronuclease(s). New approaches aimed at triggering or suppressing apoptosis may provide new therapeutic strategies and help reduce drug side effects. ',\n",
       " 'Based on the lessons learned from our project on carbocyclic nucleosides (Z01 BC 006174) regarding the mechanism of \"delayed chain termination\", three lines of investigation have been implemented to exploit each of the critical parameters necessary for efficient activity against HIV resistant lines: 1) introduction of a 4\\'-alkyl group of tunable bulk in a 2\\'-deoxyribose moiety; 2) introduction of an extra OH group elsewhere in the molecule of a 2\\',3\\'-dideoxysugar moiety to allow limited chain elongation; and 3) the incorporation of a double bond in the ribose moiety to achieve ring flatness, a property deemed essential for efficient phosphorylation by cellular kinases. Progress in these three areas is highlighted. 1) A thymidine analogue bearing a 4\\'-methyl group showed excellent properties as a delayed chain terminator when used in vitro against HIV-RT as the 5\\'-triphosphate, but failed to be recognized by cellular kinases. The compound demonstrated excellent anti-HIV activity only in cells transfected with the herpes thymidine kinase gene. In view of the importance of the nucleobase for the selection of specific cellular phosphorylation pathways, the synthesis of similar 4\\'-methyl-2\\'-deoxypurine analogues is ongoing. 2) Synthesis of a 2\\',3\\'-dideoxy adenosine analogue with a 3\\'-CH2OH chain was completed and studied. In conformational terms the position of the terminal OH of the new chain was to allow recognition by cellular kinases and to provide the polymerase the opportunity of limited chain elongation. This compound failed to displayed in vitro anti-HIV activity suggesting probable failure as a kinase substrate. Studies with the 5\\'-triphoshate analogue are in progress to determine if it operates as a delayed chain terminator. 3) In view of the reported anti-HIV activity of the natural product oxetanocin A, a compound with a flat oxetan ring, synthesis of a riboside combining a 4\\'-CH2OH for chain elongation and a 2\\',3\\'-double bond to achieve ring flatness is in progress.',\n",
       " \"My laboratory continues to explore the bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane template as a platform for the construction of conformationally locked nucleosides with the aim of determining the conformational preferences of enzymes involved in nucleoside anabolism and catabolism. This versatile template can be used to synthesize nucleoside analogues constrained into the two possible natural conformations (North and South) adopted by natural nucleosides, which has allowed us to define, for the first time, the antipodal conformational preferences displayed by kinases and polymerases. The application of this knowledge has been successfully applied to the design and synthesis of nucleoside analogues directed to precise therapeutic targets in HIV, herpes and pox viruses. The success of the chemically synthesized North-methanocarbathymidine (N-MCT)-5'-triphosphate as a delay chain terminator of HIV RT and its ability to overcome the excision mechanism of HIV resistance prompted the synthesis of several new analogues capable of circumventing the principal limitation of N-MCT, which is its inability to be activated (phorphorylated) by cellular thymidine kinase (c-tk). Two lines of investigation have been pursued and some of the major findings are highlighted: 1) the successful synthesis of isomeric N-MCT analogues where the fusion site of the cyclopropane ring was relocated to facilitate recognition by c-tk, an enzyme that displays a South penchant. This approach resulted in a compound with 100-fold increased recognition by the related enzyme, herpes thymidine kinase (HSV-tk); however, recognition by the c-tk was still lacking because the relocation of the fusion site of the cyclopropane ring removed a critical OH necessary for enzyme recognition. This finding prompted us to implement the second approach, which has been synthetically more challenging: 2) ring closure metathesis to prepare intermediate precursors of the bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane template with various substitutions (R = OH, CH2OH) at the tip of the fused cyclopropane ring that could simultaneously lead to recognition by c-tk and allow chain elongation by the polymerase from a different position. Functionalization at the tip of the cyclopropane ring has been successfully achieved for R = CH2OH and efforts to prepare the more important, but synthetically more difficult hydroxycyclopronane analogue (R = OH) continue. During this period patent applications for N-MCT as the most potent antiviral agent against human herpes virus 8, the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, and small pox have been submitted. A manuscript describing the former activity is in press and the second one is in preparation. The study on DNA bending continues with the syntheses of segments built with conformationally locked North sugars. This work was completed and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA. The study of the unusual properties of identical DNA segments built with Southern units continues.\",\n",
       " 'A. Protein Kinase C ProjectThe universe of synthetic DAG-lactones designed as potent PKC ligands continues to expand with the objective of achieving full isozyme specificity. The major findings this year are: 1) Syntheses of additional 96-member libraries on a solid-phase support continue with the intent to maximally explore the chemical space surrounding the binding site at the protein-membrane interface. New chemical improvements in the synthesis and characterization of the library members by mass spectrometry continue to be made.2) The first specific DAG-lactone targeting a non-kinase protein containing a C1 domain was discovered. The compound binds with low nanomolar binding affinity to RasGRP while showing weak binding activity for the PK-C isozymes. The biological consequences of this selective binding are being explored. 3) The synthesis of DAG-lactones with a side chain in the form of a \"rigid rod\" constructed with alternating acetylene units and benzene rings was completed Preliminary biological studies indicate a correlation between length of the \"rigid rod\" and depth of artificial membranes built with different fatty acids. If successful, this approach will be used to translocate DAG-lactones exclusively to the plasma membrane.4) One of the target DAG-lactones synthesized showed very potent activity in stimulating alpha-secretase activity, which is an important therapeutic approach in the treatment of Alzheimer\\'s disease. B. Flavone acetic acid analogues. A synthetic analogue of flavone acetic acid (FAA) with an azido group designed to function as a biological reported was synthesized and shown to be as active as parent FAA. The azide moiety will be used to find the molecular target responsible for the activity of FAA. C. DNA Methyl Transferase Project (Zebularine). The ability of zebularine 2(1H)-pyrimidinone riboside to reactivate a silenced p16 gene and demethylate the promoter region in the T24 bladder carcinoma and other tumor cell lines was demonstrated. Several monophosphate pro-drug of 2\\'-deoxyzebularine were synthesized in order to overcome the low level of incorporation into DNA. The first two pro-drugs tested failed, and more analogues are being explored. Zebularine is scheduled to enter clinical trials before the end of the year.',\n",
       " 'The development of methods using capillary electrophoresis (CE) to measure and characterize synthetic nucleotide mixtures as well as intracellular nucleotide metabolites continues. Our previous work has shown that quantitative on-line sample-stacking produces a more than 100-fold signal enhancement for the CE analysis of nucleotides. These methods have been applied to characterize and study the hydrolytic and enzymatic stability of mixtures of synthetic nucleotide derivatives. Biologically derived mixtures of nucleotides, however, show a marked deterioration in signal and resolution upon sample-stacking and CE analysis because of the high ionic strength of these samples. Sample preparation methods and analysis strategies to overcome this effect have been explored and have provided some success, resulting in a 20- to 30-fold signal enhancement for biological samples. This investigation continues. We are also evaluating whole-column sample stacking for the micropreparative CE isolation of trace nucleotide metabolites for structural analysis by MALDI mass spectrometry. This will have application for the determination and measurement of the active intracellular nucleotide metabolites of the nucleoside-based reverse transcriptase inhibitors that are used in AIDS therapy. Nucleoside-based reverse transcriptase inhibitors comprise an important class of therapeutically useful drugs for AIDS. The Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry has had a long-standing program studying conformationally locked nucleosides as potential anti-AIDS and anticancer agents. During the course of these studies it has come to be recognized that the conformation of nucleoside sugar can profoundly affect its chemical and biological properties. We have experimentally confirmed that this is indeed the case in two conformationally locked dideoxyadenosine (ddA) analogues where the orientation of the sugar oxygens lone pair orbitals are frozen to either enhance or impair the strength of the anomeric effect. Where the anomeric effect is enhanced, the glycosidic bond is lengthened and the nucleoside becomes more susceptible to hydrolysis. At pH 2, the conformationally locked ddA analogue with an enhanced anomeric effect has a depurination rate more than 6-fold greater than that of its structural isomer. Both ddA analogues, however, are more stable than ddA itself which has a half-life of only 2.67 min at pH 2.',\n",
       " \"Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS MS), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, accurate mass measurement for elemental composition determination, and combined capillary electrophoresis (CE) and mass spectrometry remain the techniques of current interest. MALDI MS using special energy-transferring surfaces and direct laser-desorption ionization (LDI) without the presence of a matrix shows some promise for the rapid analysis of small molecules (molecular weight range = 200-1000). The ions from the low-molecular-weight matrices used for conventional MALDI MS often obscure the low mass range of the mass spectrum because they are in 100- to 1000-fold excess to the sample. LDI mass spectra could be obtained from a wide variety of molecular structures including those compounds that would not be expected to readily absorb energy from a UV laser. Studies are ongoing to compare LDI with conventional MALDI MS in order to define the advantages and limits of each for small molecule analysis. The goal is to choose the MALDI or LDI method that gives the best chance of providing unambiguous molecular weight information. Both normal and unconventional (e.g. graphite) MALDI matrices are being investigated in this study. LDI MS spectra usually exhibit extensive alkali metal ion cationization and this can make determination of the molecular weight problematic, especially if the sample is impure or is a mixture. MALDI spectra obtained using graphite from pencil lead also show the same behavior in addition to substantial variation depending on the source of the pencil lead. The best overall small molecule MALDI mass spectra are obtained using 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) as a matrix. The off-line combination of MALDI MS with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is also under investigation as an alternate approach for the targeted analysis of complex biological and synthetic mixtures. This approach involves automatically collecting and spotting the HPLC eluent along with an appropriate matrix on a MALDI sample plate for subsequent MS analysis, which can include accurate mass measurement and post-source decay fragmentation analysis or MS MS. An advantage of this approach over on-line LC MS is the generation of an archive of the original separated sample for re-analysis. Synthetic derivatives built on a constrained diacylated glycerol scaffold (DAG-lactones) are potent agonists of protein kinase C (PK-C). Depending on the structure of the substituents corresponding to the acyl groups R1 and R2, these DAG-lactones exhibit varying degrees of PK-C isozyme specificity. A solid-phase combinatorial approach is being applied in the LMC to investigate chemical diversity at R1 and R2 in order to produce more specific C1 domain ligands. It is important that these synthetic libraries be rapidly characterized and their structures established before biological evaluation. One method used for the initial characterization of these synthetic DAG-lactone libraries employs a combine-and-analyze strategy with rapid analysis of the resultant simple mixtures by fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry. This approach substantially reduces the number of samples to be examined, results in enhanced analytical turn-around while providing extensive structural and sample information. It is also amenable to rapid accurate mass measurement to determine elemental composition and provide an additional dimension of structure information. ESI MS is not suitable for analysis of these DAG-lactones because the high lipophilicity and limited basicity of these compounds results in very poor and variable ionization. Flow-injection APCI MS of individual DAG-lactones produces spectra that consist of MH+ as well as various fragment and solvent-adduct ions. This later approach, especially if MS MS techniques are used, appears to be complementary to FAB MS in terms of spectral information, although it is not suitable for mixture analysis. However, flow-injection APCI MS is amenable to automation and allows multiple analyses of the same sample to be carried out unattended. MALDI MS also appears useful as a tool for the rapid characterization of these small molecule libraries although variable alkali metal ion cationization complicates spectral interpretation. Optimization of matrix (see above) and automation of the sample deposition process are under investigation as an approach to resolve this problem and provide an even more rapid analysis approach. Our goal is the comprehensive structural characterization of all 96 library components in one day. Nucleoside and nucleotide prodrugs of the orally active DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 2(1H)-pyrimidinone riboside (zebularine) continue under investigation. Zebularine exhibits high activity in inhibiting DNA methylation both in vitro and in vivo but low potency relative to other known inhibitors of DNMT. It is postulated that incorporation of zebularine into DNA is required before the drug can function as an inhibitor of DNMT by formation of a tight complex between it and the enzyme. We have previously shown that the intracellular metabolic activation of zebularine is both complex and inefficient, resulting in only very limited DNA incorporation. Since DNA incorporation requires the activated 2'-deoxynucleotide, the metabolic bottleneck for DNA incorporation appears to be the conversion of zebularine-5'-diphosphate to 2'-deoxyzebularine-5'-diphosphate by ribonucleotide reductase. 2'-Deoxyzebularine itself shows no inhibitory activity for DNA methylation. We have found that this lack of activity for 2'-deoxyzebularine is due to it being an extremely poor substrate for the mammalian cellular kinases responsible for the initial phosphorylation step. A second problem with zebularine has been the rapid in vivo metabolism of the parent drug by aldehyde oxidase before it can enter cells and be phosphorylated. Nucleoside prodrugs, which are resistant to aldehyde oxidase and which can be activated by plasma esterases, are being synthesized in the LMC in an attempt to increase intracellular concentrations of zebularine and hence overall metabolic activation. Chromatographic and mass spectral methods are being used to assist the synthesis of these prodrugs and to evaluate their chemical and enzymatic stability in vitro. As a proof of principle, analysis of extracts of treated cells by CE and MS will be used to evaluate whether there is any enhancement of the production of phosphorylated metabolites.\",\n",
       " 'A. Understanding the behavior of bioregulatory networks is critical for future progress in biology and therapeutics. Because of the complexity and high interconnectivity of these networks, reliable understanding can be achieved only with the aid of computer simulation studies. It is questionable however whether the present state of knowledge is sufficient for computational simulations of large systems to yield useful results. We took an alternative approach, based on the notion that essential behavior is already encoded in simple subsystems, and that further complexity serves to modulate this behavior. This possibility is attractive from considerations of evolution and system robustness. A second premise for the current investigation was that the response characteristics of the fundamental subsystems are often switch-like. We showed how this approach can facilitate linkage between theory and experiment. The subject of our investigation was the network that controls the induction of a set of genes in response to hypoxia. This was an attractive subject for theoretical study, because extensive (albeit yet incomplete) information has accumulated about relevant molecular and biological behavior, and because there is a clearly defined dependence of an output on an input. The input is the concentration of molecular oxygen, and the output is the activation of promoters that are under the control of hypoxia-regulated elements (HRE). We showed how a model (\"core\") subsystem can be selected from a molecular interaction map, how it can be encoded for computer survey of parameter space, how switch-like behavior can be found, and how the results may predict or guide experiments. This work was recently published (Kohn et al. 2004 Molec. Biol. Cell 15: 3042-52). We are collaborating with the Laboratory of Biosystems, CCR, NCI, which has been studying the hypoxia control system, we plan to test our theoretical predictions and to develop the theoretical model further guided by the results of experiments.B. In order to utilize most effectively the vast new information about the molecular interactions that make up the cell\\'s regulatory networks, we urgently need a graphical method that will have the same utility that circuit diagrams serve for electronics. Complexity does not by itself make it hard to prepare diagrams. Metabolic pathway diagrams, for example, are commonly displayed on large wall charts. Bioregulatory networks, on the other hand, present special difficulties that are rarely encountered in the classical metabolic pathways: (1) function often depends on multimolecular complexes; (2) function is often modulated by multiple covalent modifications, such as phosphorylations of proteins; (3) bioregulatory proteins commonly consist of multiple domains with different functions, which may interact within the same molecule. We have developed a notation specifically suited for bioregulatory networks, and refer to the resulting diagrams as \"molecular interaction maps\" (because they can in fact be used like road maps to discern paths and connections) (Kohn 1999 Molec. Biol. Cell; Kohn 2001 Chaos; Aladjem et al. 2004 Science\\'). We have used this notation to generate maps of several key networks that function in cell proliferation control and have deposited some of them on John N. Weinstein\\'s internet site: http: discover.nci.nih.gov. In collaboration with our LMP colleagues Mirit Aladjem and the Weinstein group, we have linked the maps with other bioinformatics databases. In addition, we are providing user-friendly features for navigation through the networks. Each molecular interaction is linked to an annotation that provides salient information and reference citations, so that the evidence bearing on each interaction can be evaluated.In addition to encyclopedic molecular interaction maps, which are analogous to road maps, we are preparing review articles that are analogous to guide-books.',\n",
       " 'Aberrant pTyr-dependent signaling is associated with the etiology of several cancers. For this reason, pharmacological agents are being developed to modulate phosphotyrosyl (pTyr) dependent cell signaling as potential new therapeutics. The approach used is predicated on the fact that pTyr-dependent signaling consists of three components related to cellular processing and manipulation of pTyr residues. These three components are: (1) The generation of pTyr-containing sequences by protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs); (2) The recognition and binding to pTyr-containing sequences by src homology 2 (SH2) domains and (3) The destruction of pTyr sequences through phosphate ester hydrolysis by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Accordingly, a unifying theme of this project is the design and synthesis of inhibitors directed at each of the three components. In the SH2 domain area, high affinity growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2)-binding antagonists are being prepared as potential new therapeutics for erbB-2 and c-Met dependent cancers. As part of a collaborative effort with NCI clinical investigators (Drs. Don Bottaro and Marston Linehan), our Grb2 signaling inhibitors are being studied against von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-dependent kidney cancers that rely on Grb2 dependent signaling pathways. In cellular studies, certain of these agents inhibit hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell migration in Met containing fibroblasts at nanomolar concentrations and inhibit tubule formation potentially involved in angiogenesis. We have previously prepared a potent antagonist of Grb2 SH2 domain-binding that blocks growth factordriven cell motility in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. Our collaborators have now shown that this agent inhibits metastasis in vivo in two aggressive tumor models, without affecting primary tumor growth rate. This supports the potential efficacy of this compound in reducing the metastatic spread of primary solid tumors and establishes a critical role for Grb2 SH2 domainmediated interactions in this process. We had previously reported using ring-closing metathesis (RCM) to prepare novel macrocycles designed as conformationally constrained peptide mimetics of our open-chain tripeptide inhibitors. The high synthetic complexity of these macrocyclic peptide mimetics was in part due to the stereoselective construction of a key upper ring-forming junction. In order to simplify synthesis, new macrocycle variants were prepared bearing upper ring junctions that (1) were prepared non-stereoselectively; (2) utilized commercially-available allylglycine residue or (3) employed symmetrical achiral moieties. These investigations have advanced the field of macrocyclic peptidomimetic synthesis. Efforts were also undertaken to develop SH2 domain-directed peptide mimetic inhibitors of Shc-dependent signaling. Shc proteins are non-catalytic SH2 domain-containing docking modules that participate in a variety of cell-regulatory processes associated with proliferation, survival and apoptosis. Shc as well as Grb2 proteins are particularly important for down stream signaling of PTKs, where they have been shown to link activation of the cytoplasmic kinase domains with Ras effectors. Shc has also been shown to serve as a critical angiogenic switch for for the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) downstream from the c-Met and ErbB2 RTK oncoproteins, where recruitment of Shc but not Grb2 has been shown to be a required event. Accordingly, disruption of Shc-dependent signaling through blockade of its SH2 domain interactions may afford a new therapeutic approach to cancers reliant on disregulation of such PTKs. It has previously been reported that the 14-mer zeta-chain-T cell receptor pY141 peptide, Ac-GHDGLpYQGLSTATK-amide binds to the Shc SH2 domain with an affinity of Kd = 50 &#956;M. We prepared the hexamer partial sequence Ac-LpYQGLS-amide and found it to exhibit KD = 84 &#956;M in a Biacore binding assay. Using a fluorescence anisotropy (FA) assay developed in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Fisher (SAIC-Frederick) we undertook an exhaustive structure-activity study based on this hexamer sequence to determine the optimum placement of a fluoresceine group that would yield the highest affinity, and therefore the greatest sensitivity. We found that spacing between the fluoresceine and the peptide was critical. The highest affinity peptide gave a 100-fold enhancement (KD = 0.5 uM). Based on this peptide lead, non-fluoresceinated analogues were prepared containing functionality not present in genetically-encoded amino acids, including N-alkylglycine (peptoid) residues. In order to conduct cell-based studies, membrane carrier peptide sequences were chemically linked to select high affinity phosphopeptides resulting from these efforts. In the phosphatase area, inhibitors are being developed against the YopH PTP, which is a pathogenic component of the potential bioterrosim agent Yersinia pestis. This work is being done in collaboration with Drs. Robert Ulrich (USAMRIID) and David Waugh (NCI). A focused library approach has been used wherein two aromatic fragments are joined together by a series of linker segments. This has led to the identification of low micromolar affinity inhibitors that are undergoing further optimization. In the area of PTK inhibitor development, the high affinity Sugen Pharmaceuticals-derived c-Met kinase inhibitor SU11274 is being used as a platform to develop poly-valent kinase inhibitors. Based on molecular modeling (performed collaboratively within the Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry by Dr. Marc Nicklaus), SU11274 is hypothesized to bind deep within the well-defined c-Met catalytic cleft. Linker chains are being appended onto the SU11274 core to allow binding within the catalytic cleft with inclusion of structural functionality exterior to catalytic cleft. One objective of this work is to join together multiple SU11274 units to take allow simultaneous binding to two or more c-Met kinase domains. This work has the potential to advance the development of PTK inhibitors in general',\n",
       " 'A major focus of this research group is the study of the cellular responses to genotoxic and related stresses in mammalian cells. This has included the cloning and characterization of a variety of DNA-damage-inducible (DDI) genes, including the gadd genes, and elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms controlling their expression. Cell-cycle checkpoint activation and growth inhibition are universal responses to genotoxic stress. We have found that the 5 gadd (growth-arrest and DNA-damage inducible) genes to be coordinately induced by cellular exposure to many DNA-damaging agents and certain other stresses that trigger growth arrest (Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9:4196). Evidence for such responses have been found in all mammalian cells examined to date and indicate that this is a well-conserved stress response(s). In the case of Gadd45a, this was the first cellular gene found to be regulated by the key tumor suppressor p53 via a pathway that is activated by ionizing radiation (and many other stresses). This pathway also involves ATM, the gene defective in ataxia telangiectasia (Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11:1009; Cell 1992; 71:587). Responses to ionizing radiation have been characterized in a variety of human tumor lines including the regulation of key cell death genes like BAX, BCL2, BCL-X, KILLER DR5 , TRID TRAIL-R3 (Oncogene 1998; 17:3287). This laboratory has shown that a functional and physical interaction between p53 and WT1 plays a central role in the regulation of such genes after certain stresses, such as UV radiation (Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18:2768). Interestingly, the same promoter control element, which binds to WT1, has been found to be suppressed by c-Myc, a growth-stimulatory signaling protein (Oncogene 1998; 17:2149). Moreover, deletion of c-Myc has been found to markedly upregulate the Gadd45a growth-arrest gene. Both c-myc and Brca1 are implicated in breast cancer, and have been shown to contribute to the regulation of the Gadd45a gene. We have also shown that the p38 kinases of the MAP kinase pathway have an important role in activation of p53 after certain stresses (EMBO J. 1999; 18:6845). We have gone on to show that p38 plays a central role in G2 checkpoint activation (Nature 2001; 411:102), regulation of the key cell cycle Cdc25 proteins (Nature Cell Biology 2003; 5:545), and tumor suppression (Nature Genetics 2002; 31:210; 2004; 36:343). We have applied a functional genomics approach to the study of DDI genes. Using cDNA microarray hybridization, a very complex pattern of responses has been found in various human cells which is dependent on p53 status, apoptotic potential, and a variety of other control factors (Oncogene 1999; 18:3666; Oncogene 2003; 22:5828; Cancer Research 2004; 64: 6368). Characterization of such responses in tumor cells will be used to elucidate the status of signal transduction pathways and may have predictive value in treatment planning.A second major focus is the characterization of the products encoded by particular stress genes with emphasis on p53-regulated genes. This project involves both a genetic and biochemical approach. Targeted disruption of the Gadd45a gene has been carried out in mice and characterization of these mice is currently underway. Studies are being expanded to other engineered mice including strains with disruption of p53, cip1waf1 (Cdkna1), Gadd45b, Gadd45g, Gadd34, and other selected genes. Defects in important parameters, such as genomic stability, growth control, resistance to carcinogenesis, and DNA repair, have been found in Gadd45a- - mice (Nature Genetics 1999; 23:176) (Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23,3859). From analysis of these various knockout strains, cip1 waf1, gadd45, and other effector genes contribute to the phenotype of p53- - mice. Targeted disruption of related DDI genes is currently underway. Using a biochemical approach, this laboratory has already demonstrated interactions between Gadd45a with p38, PCNA, p21Cip1 Waf1, Cdc2, and core histone proteins, and evidence for roles in signal transduction, immune regulation, DNA repair and cell cycle control. The goal of these studies is to contribute to the understanding of the function of these and related DDI genes, and their potential as targets for cancer therapy in the future.More details on this project and a complete bibliography can be found at http: rex.nci.nih.gov RESEARCH basic lbc fornace.htm',\n",
       " \"In an effort to further extend the number of targets for development of antiretroviral agents, we are investigating potential HIV integrase inhibitors using in vitro integrase assays. The active compounds are submitted for testing their antiviral activity in the NCI Anti-HIV Drug Screen. Conversely, we are testing active compounds from the screen for HIV1 integrase inhibition. The molecular interactions of drugs with the HIV1 integrase are investigated by comparing the drugs effects using several assays exploring different steps of the integration reaction: 1) DNA binding, 2) dinucleotide cleavage and differential use of attacking nucleophiles (water, 3'-DNA terminus, glycerol), 3) strand transfer (integration), 4) dis-integration (reverse of the integration reaction) by wild-type and truncated HIV1 integrases. Our goals are to discover new antiviral agents, to determine whether drug screening of active agents will lead to the discovery of integrase inhibitors, to evaluate which step of the integration reaction can be inhibited by drugs (enzyme oligomerization, DNA binding, 3'processing, DNA strand transfer, disintegration), and to determine the drug binding site(s) in the HIV1 integrase. In order to test the hypothesis that some of the inhibitors interfere selectively with a specific functional domain of the enzyme (zinc finger, catalytic region, DNA binding domain), genetically altered HIV1 integrases are used. Discovery of HIV integrase inhibitors may provide new strategies for antiretroviral therapy and basic knowledge for drug-enzyme interactions. During the past year, we have continued our studies with nucleotide inhibitors and identified a series of dinucleotides active in the uM range and water-soluble. Nucleotides are attractive as lead compounds for co-crystallization studies. We have also shown that guanosine quartet derivatives are active at nanomolar concentrations and exhibit antiviral activity. In collaboration with the medicinal chemists, we have continued our structure-activity studies from CAPE derivatives and identified novel classes of inhibitors from the active compounds of the NCI screen. Finally, a novel assay has been developed to monitor integrase-DNA binding, that can be used to further investigate the enzyme-DNA interactions and the effects of inhibitors. \",\n",
       " 'Pharmacogenomic and pharmacoproteomic approaches are creating major opportunities for progress in rational drug discovery and individualization of therapy for cancer patients. That much is clear. But taking advantage of the potential has proved more difficult than expected. One reason is that no single type of molecular information captures all of the relevant pharmacological and toxicological phenomena. Data on mRNA expression, protein expression, post-translational modifications, DNA copy number, SNP\\'s, chromosomal aberrations, transcription factors, RNA-mediated regulation, CpG methylation, and molecular interactions of many types can all contribute. We need a research strategy that generates and integrates all of those types of information and more. The Genomics & Bioinformatics Group (GBG) is developing such a strategy, based on an integrative systems orientation and on synergy between traditional hypothesis-driven and \\'omic\\' research. This project has been considered by at least one leader in the Human Cancer Genome Project as presaging that enterprise and providing useful background expertise for it. We have had to confront, in microcosm, many of the same issues - related to harvesting and quality-control of cancer samples, optimization of purification methods, optimization of experimental platforms, primary data analysis, integration of different data types, statistical and machine-learning multivariate analysis, biological interpretation, and management of relationships as the hub of collaborative interactions with numerous high-profile investigators and institutions.The GBG\\'s studies are part experimental, part computational. Although we\\'re ultimately interested in clinical tumors, many of our experiments are done in vitro with isogenic cell sets, with selected resistant variants, or with the 60 human cancer cell types (the NCI-60) used by the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program to screen >100,000 chemical compounds for anticancer activity since 1990. Largely through studies by the GBG and collaborators, the NCI-60 are by far the most comprehensively profiled panel of mammalian cells anywhere. Cells in culture don\\'t reflect the complexity of the in vivo environment, of course, but they circumvent the logistical issues, lack of homogeneity, lack of reproducibility, and artifacts of clinical materials. When hypotheses based on cell line data relate to the clinic, we often test them using tissue arrays. Five of our findings with clinical implications are (i) identification of biomarkers to distinguish colon from ovarian tumors of unknown origin, (ii) identification of asparagine synthetase as a predictor of ovarian cancer cell response to L-asparaginase; (iii) formulation of the \"Permissive-Apoptosis Resistance\" (PAR) two-step model for development of acquired drug resistance; (iv) discovery of \\'MDR1-inverse\\' compounds more active in cancer cells that express large amounts of MDR1; (v) critical evidence in the 1990\\'s that led to clinical development of oxaliplatin, now a \\'standard-of-care\\' agent for therapy of both primary and recurrent colorectal cancer.

       " \"Cancer metastasis, or the migration of cancer cells from the primary loci is the major cause of death. Matriptase is a large transmembrane serine protease, originally isolated from the extracellular domain of human mammary epithelial cells. Overexpression of this membrane bound protease on cancer cells functions in the degradation of extracellular matrix. Matriptase activates hepatocyte growth factor by a specific proteolytic cleavage. It also activates urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and also the protease activated receptor-2. Based on these biological functions of Matriptase, developing inhibitors to Matriptase may provide therapeutic applications to the prevention of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Our aim in this project is to develop selective inhibitors to Matriptase, as a way of inhibiting the metastatic and oncogenic cell proliferation. Several years ago we discovered that a bicyclic cage-like conformationally restricted, and proteolytically stable cyclopeptide natural product, termed SFTI-1, inhibited the matriptase enzyme, with an impressive Ki of 0.92 nM. To date, we have prepared 17 analogs of these cyclopeptidic protease inhibitors, including redox stable analogs of the disulfide linkage. We have the task to develop selective agents that minimize the deleterious effect of SFTI analogs on other physiologically required trypsin chymotrypsin family of enzymes. Our collaborators at the Lombardi Cancer Center evaluated SFTI-1 in matriptase expressing tumor bearing mice. Significant survival promoting effect was observed with as little as 10 ug SFTI-1 per day treatment of mice with implanted ovarian tumor cells. Our small drug-like inhibitors may function as metastasis inhibitors. Results may also corroborate the idea that populations which consume substantially more legumes in their diets that contain natural related protease inhibitors, have relatively lower incidences of prostate, colon, breast and skin cancers. Our laboratory has also been interested in developing experimental anti-HIV agents. Integrase is an attractive target because it has no counterpart in mammalian cells; therefore, selective integrase inhibitors should not produce any toxicity. The complex mechanism of integrase function poses a challenging opportunity for enzyme inhibitor design. In this regard, we have identified a tryptophan rich natural product peptide, termed indolicidin, with a sequence of Ile-Leu-Pro-Trp-Lys-Trp-Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro-Trp-Arg-Arg. Robinson's group discovered that this 13 amino acid long peptide showed anti-HIV activity, and suggested a membrane -mediated mechanism for its antiviral activity. We carried out selective modifications of this initial peptide sequence, including construction of covalently linked tetrameric constructs. These efforts produced a 100-fold more potent integrase inhibitory agent with an IC50 of 0.6 microM. These results support the hypothesis that multimeric inhibitory peptides may act as multivalent inhibitors, simultaneously occupying two or four neighboring catalytic sites within the integrase oligomeric complex.\",\n",
       " 'Inhibitors directed against three distinct points in the HIV-1 life cycle are being prepared. These inhibitors are intended to serve as potential new therapeutics and as pharmacological probes to investigate biochemical mechanisms of viral replication. The three areas of investigation are: (1) HIV-1 integrase (IN), where inhibitors may disrupt incorporation of viral cDNA into the host genome; (2) Binding of HIV p6Gag protein to human Tsg101 protein, where inhibitors may disrupt viral assembly and budding and (3) Binding of human cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G) to the HIV-1 protein Vif, where inhibitors may result in hyper-mutation of proviral DNA. (1) HIV-1 IN inhibitors: Although a large number of inhibitors have been reported in the literature, diketoacid (DKA)-derived agents have recently shown particular promise, with members of this genre showing significant promise in anti-AIDS clinical trials. These agents are thought to function by chelating Mg2+ ions at the IN catalytic site, where they selectively inhibit strand transfer (ST) reactions over 3-processing (3-P) reactions. We had previously reported the bis-salicylhydrazides class of IN inhibitors that we also hypothesized function by metal chelation. However, members of this series exhibit potent inhibition only when Mn2+ is used as cofactor and not when the physiologically-relevant Mg2+ is used. Our recent findings have shown that bis-aroylhydrazides could acquire inhibitory potency in the presence of Mg2+ through the inclusion of dihdroxybenzoyl substituents. Good selectivity for IN-catalyzed ST versus 3-P reactions could also be achieved using a 2,3-dihydro-6,7-dihydroxy-1H-isoindol-1-one ring system as a conformationally-constrained 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl equivalent. Adding a second oxo-group to the isoindole-1-one ring system gave the phthalimide-based isoindole-1,3(2H)-diones, which generally exhibited enhanced of 3-P and ST inhibitory potencies. Antiviral effects in cultured cells using HIV-1 based vectors showed that the certain bicyclic conformationally constrained analogues exhibited sub-micromolar antiviral potencies against HIV-1 infected cells. This work indicates that the 4,5-dihydroxyphthalimide nucleus offers a structurally simple starting point for the further development of IN inhibitors. (2) Tsg101-binding inhibitors: Binding of the HIV p6Gag protein to human Tsg101 protein has been shown to be necessary for viral budding and to involve a critical 9-mer P-E-P-T-A-P-P-E-E sequence of the p6 protein. We are preparing peptide and peptide mimetic variants of this 9-mer sequence as Tsg101-binding antagonists that may lead to a new class of viral budding inhibitors. One approach was to replace the Pro4 residue with N-substitued glycine (NSG) residues (termed peptoids). However, this is synthetically problematic. Therefore, we resorted to a new family of peptoid variants that incorporate hydrazone amides as NSG surrogates. These can be prepared readily in library fashion by reacting a series of aldehydes with a single HPLC-purified hydrazide precursor following cleavage from the solid-phase resin. Reduction of these hydrazones to N-substitued peptoid hydrazides affords a facile route to library diversification. We have extended these studies by replacing several key residues in the parent p6-derived 9-mer sequence with other non-natural amino acid analogues. A unifying principal guiding our approach has been the incorporation of amino-oxy functionality into the residues that can be functionalized in a single final step to provide a library of oxime derivatives. This approach has resulted in the identification of several low micromolar affinity Tsg101 binding antagonists. Ongoing optimization of binding affinity is being continued by a variety of means, including macrocyclization using ring-closing metathesis chemistries. X-ray crystal studies of inhibitors complexed with Tsg101 protein are in progress to provide information for the design of higher affinity second generation analogues by structure-based techniques. (3) Inhibitors of proteosomal targeting of human cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G) binding by the HIV-1 protein Vif: After infection of a target cell and during reverse transcription of HIV-1 RNA into DNA, the human A3G enzyme deaminates C residues in the minus strand, converting them to U residues. This results in encoding of A residues in the plus strand DNA in place of the original G residues, with the net effect being hypermutation of proviral DNA. The HIV-1 23 kDa cytoplasmic protein Vif overcomes the antiviral effects of A3G by binding to it and targeting it for proteasomal degradation. The laboratory of Dr. Vinay Pathak (CCR, NCI, NIH) has shown that the Vif protein sequence S(144)LQYLA(149) is critical for targeting A3G to the proteosome. Our initial work has been to prepare fluoresceine isothiocyanate (FITC)-derived peptide conjugates for use in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Fisher (SAIC, Inc., NCI-Frederick) to develop Vif fluorescence anisotropy binding assays. In collaboration with Dr. Pathaks laboratory, we will conduct structure-activity studies on the SLQYLA sequence to develop high affinity, cell-permeable analogues that can effectively block proteosomal targeting of A3G by Vif. Among the techniques planned for this work is the use of hydrazone and oxime peptide libraries as described above for Tsg101-binding inhibitors',\n",
       " 'Biological membranes undergo continuous remodeling in processes that transfer material between organelles while maintaining organellar identity and affect the assembly and reassembly of organelles necessary for progression through mitosis. The main objective of the work in this laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the membrane remodeling involved in these processes. The role of the Arf family of GTP-binding proteins has been our focus. The hypothesis being tested is that regulating hydrolysis of GTP on Arf in turn regulates the consumption of protein coated vesicles that mediate membrane remodeling. Consistent with this model, a GTPase- activating protein (GAP) for Arf has been found to be specifically dependent on two phospholipids, phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The GAP has been purified and cloned. The sequence has revealed a number of domains that are likely relevant to function and regulation, including a 350 a.a. overlap with the general vesicular transport factor p115, a PH domain, a Zn finger domain, ankyrin repeats, a proline rich region including type 1 and type 2 ligands for SH3 domain binding, an SH3 domain, a potential cell cycle dependent kinase phosphorylation site and several potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites. To test our hypothesis that modulation of Arf GAP regulates membrane remodeling, we will begin by focusing on the PH domain and potential phosphorylation sites. ',\n",
       " \"Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) play an important role in cell growth and development. Signaling from the EGFR has many effects including cell growth and division, proliferation and angiogenesis. EGFRs are inappropriately expressed or highly expressed in a variety of human tumors including breast, brain, prostate and others. Overexpression of the EGFR has been associated with advanced tumor stage, resistance to standard therapies and, in some tumors, with poor patient prognosis. The critical role of EGFR in both normal and abnormal cell growth and development has lead to the development of therapeutic agents directed against the EGFR. Targeting the EGFR necessitates a clear understanding of the regulation of its' expression. We hypothesize that changes in transcription factors interacting with the EGFR promoter leads to increased expression in the absence of gene amplification. Our research focuses on two projects seeking to understand the factors that regulate EGFR expression during normal cell growth and in cancer. We seek to determine the transcription factors involved in EGFR gene regulation and to examine their role in cancer. We further seek to understand how GC-binding factor 2 (GCF2), a repressor of EGFR expression, decreases the activity of cellular and viral promoters. We initially characterized the EGFR promoter region as a GC-rich, TATA-less regulatory region with multiple transcription initiation sites and specificity protein 1 (Sp1) binding sites. Many DNA-binding factors have been identified that interact with the promoter region including p53, activator protein 1 (AP1), AP2 and interferon regulated factor 1 (IRF-1). We found that the p53 homologue, p63, repressed EGFR expression through protein-protein interactions with Sp1, an activator of EGFR expression. Egr-1 was determined to increase endogenous EGFR expression. Furthermore, we were able to show that upregulation of egr-1 during hypoxia leads to increased EGFR expression. Recently we demonstrated that curcumin, the active ingredient of the rhizome of the plant turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn), suppressed the gene expression of EGFR in human colon cancer-derived cell lines, including Moser cells, Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. EGFR promoter deletions and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the binding site for the transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in the promoter of EGFR gene acted as a cis-activating element in regulating the promoter activity of the gene in Moser cells. Gel shift assays and chromatin immuno-precipitation assays demonstrated that curcumin significantly reduced the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor Egr-1. Further studies showed that curcumin reduced the trans-activation activity of Egr-1 by suppressing the gene expression and reducing the level of phosphorylated Egr-1, in which interruption of the ERK pathway was a necessity. Taken together, our results demonstrated that curcumin suppressed EGFR gene expression in colon cancer cells by reducing the trans-activating activity of Egr-1. We have cloned and characterized GCF2, a transcriptional repressor. We have determined the GCF2 binding site in the EGFR promoter and shown that GCF2 can partially inhibit AP2 activation of EGFR promoter activity. In addition, we have shown that GCF2 was able to bind to a highly structured RNA element TAR (transactivation response element) that is located at the 5' end of nascent HIV transcripts. GCF2 inhibits activation of the HIV-1 LTR by a small regulatory protein, Tat, which is required for efficient transcription of genes linked to the HIV-1 LTR. We further determined that the amino terminal region of GCF2 was required to repress the Tat-mediated enhancement of the HIV-1 LTR and that GCF2 can also decrease basal HIV-1 LTR activity. We have also identified two additional members of the GCF2 family, GCF2-SK (skeletal muscle) and GCF2-SM (smooth muscle). \",\n",
       " 'The mammary gland is a complex organ whose growth and development are controlled by the interaction of a wide variety of hormones and growth factors also involved in the etiology and progression of the cancerous state. Our emphasis has been on the interactions of prolactin (Prl), estrogens (E), and progesterone (P), with recent work also examining how epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factors alpha and beta are affected by the interplay of these three classical hormones. Lobulo-alveolar development of the mammary gland requires the priming action of both E and P to induce EGF receptors and production of EGF-like growth factors. E induces the P receptor at branch points of the ductal tree; P induces the Hox genes and promotes branching morphogenesis. In concert with insulin, Prl and glucocorticoids, EGF or TGF-alpha can promote full lobulo-alveolar development in vitro. Programmed cell death occurs within 3 days of removal of Prl. The apoptosis of alveolar cells is regulated, in part, by p53. Prl induced growth of NOG-8 normal mouse mammary epithelial and T47D human breast cancer cells involves activation of ras, raf-1, MEK and MAP kinases within 1 to 5 min. JAK2 and SHC are phosphorylated within 1 min. and associated with Grb2 and Sos. Stat 5 is phosphorylated within 30 min. of Prl treatment. Prl induced growth of human breast cancer cells can be blocked by non-steroidal antiestrogens such as tamoxifen (TAM) and the steroidal pure antiestrogens ICI182780 and ICI164384. This action occurs directly through the Prl receptor. This was confirmed by transfection of the genes for either the long or the short form of the Prl receptor into NIH 3T3 cells. Both forms of the receptor transmit the growth signal while only the long form promotes differentiation. Transfectants carrying either form of the receptor acquire the ability to bind TAM as well as Prl and the Prl binding is blocked by the antiestrogens. Neonatal exposure to TAM results in an adult mouse with poorly developed mammary glands containing more pre-neoplastic hyperplastic alveolar nodules. Serum Prl levels in the treated animals are constitutively elevated . The antiprolactin action of TAM may have important clinical implications for ER- PrlR+ tumors. The importance of Prl in human breast disease was confirmed by studies in MCF-7 and T47Dco cells which show that biologically active Prl is synthesized and secreted by these human breast cancer cells. Growth of both ER- and ER+ human breast cancer cells is inhibited by 70-85% by anti-Prl antibodies. Conditioned media and extracts from cells precipitated with anti-Prl antibodies, contain a single band of approximately 22kDa, the size of pituitary Prl. The breast cancer cells synthesize and secrete 0.7mu g ml of biologically active Prl which is about 30% of the level produced by pituitary cells similarly cultured. By RT-PCR, 80% of human breast cancer cell lines and 11 of 12 breast cancer biopsies have Prl message. These data suggest an autocrine role of Prl in human breast cancer which may have implications in therapy. ',\n",
       " 'Dramatic progress is being made in identifying genes involved in cancer genesis and progression. The regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) exist in two isoforms, RI and RII, forming the type-I and -II isozymes, PKA-I and PKA-II, respectively; these isozymes share an identical catalytic (C) subunit. PKA-I and PKA-II are expressed in a balance of cell growth and differentiation; this balance is, however, distorted in cancer cell lines and tumors. An antisense oligonucleotide targeted against RIa restores the functional balance of PKA-I and PKA-II, causing cancer cells to stop growing and to differentiate. Complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analysis has shown that antisense depletion of the RIa subunit downregulates the expression of a wide range of genes involved in cell proliferation and transformation while upregulating others involved in growth arrest and differentiation, which restores normal signal transduction signatures in tumors that ultimately undergo regression. Overexpression of wild type and mutant R and C subunit genes in cancer cells via inducible vectors demonstrate that only RII and RIa-P (a functional mimic of RII) transfectants exhibit inhibition of cell proliferation, reverted phenotype, and apoptosis, and downregulation of excreted PKA (a tumor marker). These results show that the C subunit of PKA, bound with the RIa regulatory subunit forming the PKA-I holoenzyme, is prone to activation in the cell, causing activation of a wide range of genes favoring cell growth. Conversely, when the C subunit is caged in the PKA-II holoenzyme complex via binding to the RII regulatory subunit, C-subunit activation becomes minimal, resulting in tumor cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Abnormal expression of the PKA isozymes may be critically involved in tumorigenesis and progression, and therefore PKA isozyme switching may offer a tumor-target-based gene therapy for cancer.',\n",
       " 'The central goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism whereby the HIV genome gains entry into the cell. Our overall approach is to kinetically resolve steps in the pathway of HIV Envelope Glycoprotein (Env)-mediated membrane fusion and to uncover physical parameters underlying those steps using a variety of biochemical, biophysical, virological, and molecular and cell biological techniques. Resolution of the characteristics of these intermediates will yield insights into the mode of action of the viral envelope glycoproteins and enable us to identify potential antibodies and inhibitors that block HIV entry and prevent infection. We have studied the mode of action of small molecule antagonists of the viral coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 and the fusion inhibitor T20 that is in advanced clinical trials. By examining fusion kinetics of various HIV strains we found that the sensitivity of HIV to entry inhibitors correlates with envelope:coreceptor affinity, receptor density and fusion kinetics. An important implication of these findings is that individuals who express lower levels of coreceptor may respond more efficiently to entry inhibitors such as T20, whose effectiveness is dependent in part on fusion kinetics. We found that membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids are involved in HIV-1 entry into cells in as much as there is a necessity to recruit the fusion complexes in a limited area of the membrane to provide the high surface density of coreceptors. We are pursuing approaches to interfere with HIV-1 entry using agents that change membrane organization. These findings may show a way to interfere with HIV infection by changing cellular levels of ceramides. We have developed new methodologies that include photosensitized labeling, membrane protein purification, tandem proteolysis and Mass Spectroscopy analysis to identify domains of HIV SIV Env that are involved in the operation of the fusion machine. Information about these domains is not accessible by current high-resolution structural determination techniques. Based on the tools acquired in these studies, we are developing photosensitized labeling as a general methodology to study nearest neighbor interactions between membrane components of signal transduction pathways in normal and transformed cells.',\n",
       " \"The general research aims of my group are to use molecular modeling and bioinformatics to analyze structure, function, and molecular evolution of membrane proteins. Membrane proteins are one of the most important classes of proteins. They comprise about 30% of most genomes and are involved in many biological processes. They are especially important in biomedical research because most targets of current pharmaceutical projects are membrane proteins. Unfortunately, membrane protein structures are difficult to determine experimentally, and most that are determined come from prokaryotes. We fill some of this structural void by developing computational methods of analyzing sequences and developing structural models of membrane proteins. We use computational analyses to do the following:1)Address questions that are not answered by crystal structures. 2)Assist in understanding similarities and differences among homologous proteins.3)Relate structural and sequence information to functional properties.4)Assist in the design and interpretation of experimental studies.Our current projects can be classified into three areas: 1) models of the structure and gating mechanisms of potassium (K+) channels and their relatives; 2) models of the structure and gating mechanisms of the large mechanosensitive channel, MscL; and 3) development of methods to analyze sequences and construct structural models of membrane proteins. Project 1. Models of K+ Channels and Their RelativesPotassium channels and related protein comprise the third largest superfamily of human genes. These proteins are found in almost all cells from bacteria on up. This category of membrane proteins contains several diverse superfamilies of channels including Na+, Ca2+, cyclic nucleotide-gated, TRP and its homologs, glutamate-activated, and Ca2+ release channels plus some K+ symporters and transporters. The smallest of these proteins are 2TM K+ channels that have four identical subunits; each of which has only two transmembrane helices, M1 and M2. A 'P' hairpin segment that spans only the outer half of the transmembrane region is located between M1 and M2. The P segment determines the selectivity of the channel. 6TM K+ channels are more complex, with each alpha subunit having four additional transmembrane segments, S1-S4, that precede the pore-forming S5-P-S6 motif (analogous to the M1-P-M2 motif of 2TM channels) and that forms a voltage-sensing domain in voltage-gated channels. Voltage-gated Ca2+ and Na+ channels have only one alpha subunit; however, it contains four homologous 6TM motifs. One of our goals is to develop structural models of the transmembrane region of at least one member of each major family of K+ channel related proteins. The importance of understanding the structure and functional mechanisms of K+ channels was recognized last year by the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Roderick MacKinnon for his work in solving the crystal structures of two 2TM (KcsA and MthK) and one 6TM (KvAP) K+ channels. An additional 2TM channel structure, KirBac1.1, has also been determined recently. The effort to determine the KirBac1.1 structure was stimulation by our identification of this bacterial homolog of eukaryotic inward rectifying K+ channels. All of these structures are from prokaryotes. We are utilizing these crystallographic data in developing structural models of the gating mechanisms of both the crystallized prokaryotic proteins and of some of their eukaryotic homologs that have been studied extensively and that are important drug targets. The KvAP structure presents a particularly interesting molecular modeling challenge. It is difficult to reconcile the crystal structure of the complete KvAP channel protein and the paddle model of the voltage-dependent gating that MacKinnon's group developed based on this structure with many experimental results and with basic principles of membrane protein energetics. We suspect that the voltage-sensing domain (S1-S4) of this structure is grossly distorted, but that a second crystal structure of an isolated voltage-sensing domain has a native open conformation. We have developed alternative models of the open KvAP channel's structure by attaching the isolated voltage-sensing domain crystal structure to the pore domain (S5-P-S6) from the crystal structure of the complete protein. Using this model as a starting point, we have developed models of resting and intermediate conformations. Our models have the 'traditional' transmembrane topology in which each of the S1-S4 segments transverses the entire transmembrane region in all conformations. Much of the movement of S4 occurs via the helical screw mechanism. We were the first group to propose this topology and gating mechanism shortly after the first voltage-gated Na+ channel sequence was determined in the mid '80's. Molecular dynamics simulations that we have performed of the protein embedded in a lipid bilayer indicate that our models are substantially more stable than is the crystal structure of the complete KvAP protein. Our models of the KvAP channel were constrained to be consistent with experimental results from other Kv channels, primarily the Shaker channel. These constraints are complicated by the facts that these proteins are evolutionarily distant and substantial data have been obtained from Shaker residue positions that are deleted or that may be in a different conformation in the KvAP sequence. To better address these issues, we have developed models of the Shaker channel that are similar to those of our KvAP models, but with some important structural differences. These adjustments make the Shaker models consistent with many experimental observations that are inconsistent with MacKinnon's paddle model of gating. We are using the general structure of our models of the KvAP and Shaker channels in different conformations to model the general backbone folding and gating mechanism of another important class of K+ channels, the Herg channels. Our alignment of the Herg, KvAP, and Shaker sequences is based upon a very large multisequence alignment of all voltage-gated and cyclic nucleotide-gated 6TM channels and upon analyses of correlated mutations among different protein families. We use results of mutagenesis experiments on Herg and closely related EAG channels, results of NMR studies, plus basic modeling principles, to adjust features of these models and to model regions, such as the long S5-P loop in Herg channels for which analogous residues are deleted in KvAP. We are also modeling how the BeKm-1 scorpion toxin binds in the outer vestibule of Herg. The Herg project is being performed in collaboration with Dr. Gea-Ny Tseng, whose lab performs mutagenesis experiments that constrain and test our models. We are also developing models for the structure and gating mechanism of a prokaryotic sodium selective channel, NaChBac. NaChBac was selected because several labs are attempting to solve its structure experimentally. Also, its sequence is intermediate between those of the voltage-gated K+ channels we have modeled and eukaryotic Ca2+ and Na+ channels. Thus models of NaChBac are a logical first step in our efforts to model these important superfamilies of Na+ and Ca2+ channels.We are performing molecular dynamics simulations of all of our membrane protein structures embedded in a lipid bilayer with water on each side. These simulations contain many atoms and are computationally intense. They help us evaluate the feasibility of our structures by comparing the energetically stability of our models to the stability of experimentally determined crystal structures. Project 2: Models of the Mechanosensitive Channel, MscLThis project exemplifies our general approach to modeling the structures and functional mechanisms of membrane proteins. We have modeled the structure of the prokaryote mechanosensitive channel, MscL, as it undergoes a very large\",\n",
       " 'A major goal of structural biology is to understand how molecules recognize and interact with one another. Comprehension of details of interactions would enhance our understanding of numerous biological processes, as well as provide a sounder basis for drug design. A basic comprehension of molecular interactions has been the goal of many of our studies, particularly through the use of coarse-grained models. Extracting interaction energies from structures, together with the general form of the overall energy distributions are some of our major efforts. During this period we have investigated two different ways to extract short-range interaction energies from protein structures and have combined them with long-range potentials to improve threading. Other studies have included how composition recognizes the type of structure (helix, sheet, alpha+beta or alpha beta), and threading with gaps and insertions. For more efficient conformation generation, we are developing a new method to enumerate or count all compact structures on a lattice using a transfer matrix formalism. The number of conformations accessible on points within predefined three-dimensional shapes is readily found with this method, yielding precise counts of conformations up to the order of 10 20. The method could therefore efficiently serve for estimating conformational entropy changes associated with changes in the shapes of compact protein structures, as well as for estimating other entropies or evaluating the feasibility of a conformation enumeration. In studies on residue packing we have investigated the distinct directional ways in which amino acids pack together. The most critical element for observing highly regular packing has been to look at residue packing in a coarse-grained way, rather than at the details of atom packing. For all interacting groups surrounding a central residue, we reorient the rigid packing unit to obtain the best overall coincidence of positions for all cases. The residue packing then becomes highly regular and leads somewhat surprisingly to discrete preferred relative positions for non-bonded residues around any interacting residue, where the geometries follow a rule of high-density sphere packing. Thus, protein residues pack closely in accord with this model in a highly regular, lattice-like way. For protein conformation simulations, this discrete view of the packing of interacting non-bonded residues reduces in significant ways, the size of the conformational space requiring either enumeration or sampling. We have begun investigating protein dynamics with a coarse-grained model having one point per residue only. This new development is based on a simple theory of fluctuations about known protein structures, the Gaussian network model. This procedure is being shown to sample satisfactorily the distribution of atomic fluctuations about the native conformation in proteins, and to yield remarkably good agreement with crystallographic temperature factors and hydrogen exchange data. Although this method is simple, results are intuitive and compelling. This approach yields a series of modes of motion, including even the slowest, most global motions, that lead to new, exciting prospects for comprehending the functional dynamics of extremely large, even supra- molecular structures. Initially we investigated the fluctuations within an entire immunoglobulin and showed directly that the hypervariable CDR loops have the highest conformational flexibilities. ',\n",
       " '1. The DNA structures in approximately 40 available crystals of DNA-protein complexes were analyzed in terms of the local sequence-specific bending, and in terms of the overall structure. (i) Local DNA anisotropy. DNA folding occurs predominantly by means of the mini-kinks, directed toward the major groove and localized in the pyrimidine-purine YR dimers (CA,TG, TA, CG) and in AG:CT steps. Bending toward the major groove is accompanied by DNA unwinding, the tendency consistent with the rules of DNA \"conformational mechanics\" established by us earlier for \"pure\" unbound B-DNA. (ii) Overall tertiary folds. DNA is often bent into non-planar loops, resembling the path of the double helix in the nucleosome. This non-planarity correlates with the non-random periodic distribution of the YR and AG dimers in the binding sites. This feature is expected to facilitate the binding of regulatory proteins to negatively supercoiled DNA in vivo. 2. DNA Bending in the Complex with p53 .Based on the X-ray data, a detailed model was proposed for the core domain of the tumor suppressor protein p53 bound to the functionally important response element Waf1. Four subunits of p53 are bound to the 20 bp long response element in a regular staggered array with dyad symmetry. DNA is bent by 25-30 degrees in the highly conserved C(A T)(T A)G parts of the Waf1 site. Importantly, this bending, caused by the protein-protein stereochemical clashes, is consistent with the DNA sequence-dependent anisotropy described above. This detailed model opens the possibilities for analyzing the human genome database aimed at establishing general mechanisms of p53 tumor suppressor binding to DNA organized in chromatin. ',\n",
       " 'Our research goal emphasizes developing novel, sophisticated algorithms that integrate statistical and computational tools for RNA folding, pattern search, sequence and structure comparison. These tools find non-coding (ncRNAs) and functional RNA elements, and enable analyses of complete genome sequences. Our scientific accomplishments during the past year are summarized as follows:A. Development of computer algorithms for analyses of RNA structures and the discovery of ncRNAs, RNA motifs and RNA functional elements.Functional RNAs have characteristic RNA structural motifs represented by specific combinations of base pairings and conserved nucleotides in loop regions. Discovery of distinct well-ordered structures and their homologues in genome-wide searches will enhance our ability to discover RNA structural motifs and help us to highlight their association with functional ncRNAs and regulatory RNA elements. In collaboration with Prof. Zhang\\'s Lab. (Dept. of Computer Science, Univ. of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada), we developed a novel computer algorithm , HomoStRscan, that takes a single RNA sequence along with its secondary structure to search for homologous RNAs in complete genomes. This novel algorithm differs completely from other currently used search algorithms for homologous structures or structural motifs in two important aspects: first, it takes detailed account of information of both the primary sequence and the secondary structural constraints of the query RNA including each base-pair in duplexes and each nucleotide in the single strands; second, the homologous RNA structures are strictly inferred from a robust statistical distribution of a quantitative measure, maximal similarity score. The method provides a flexible, robust and fine search tool for any homologous structural RNAs. To test this novel program we searched for 5S rRNA and tRNA in bacterial genome databases. Our results from more than 20 bacterial genomes indicate that HomoStRscan discovers these ncRNAs with high sensitivity specificity ratios. Our computational experiments for these complete genomic sequences indicate that HomoStRscan detects 100% of the true 5S rRNAs with no false positives. Moreover, HomoStRscan finds new 5S rRNA genes in several bacterial genomes that are not currently annotated in the database.HomoStRscan can also discover tRNAs in the genomic sequences with very high sensitivity specificity ratios, even if those tRNAs have introns. Our test for tRNA genes in K.lactis yeast genome of 10.6 Mb correctly predicts all tRNA genes listed in published databases, and also predicts an additional 31 tRNAs, most of which have intron sequences of various sizes within the anticodon loop.In general, our method can be used to search for any RNA segments that have established secondary structure. The search for ncRNAs is being conducted on a large scale using HomoStRscan and rna_match for known ncRNAs.B. Development of computer programs StemEd and SigStem for the statistical inference of local well-ordered structures in genomic sequences.Discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs)suggests that there are a large class of small non-coding RNAs in eukaryotic genomes. These miRNAs have the potential to form distinct, fold-back, stem-loop structures. The prediction of these well-ordered, folding sequences (WFS) in genomic sequences is very helpful for our understanding of RNA-based gene regulation and the determination of local RNA elements with structure-dependent functions. Previously, we developed EDscan and SigED that have the power to discover such distinct WFS by scanning successive segments along a sequence and evaluating the difference between E_diff of the natural sequence and those computed from randomly shuffled sequences. The measure E_diff of a given RNA segment here is same as was defined in the previous EDscan method, where E_diff is the difference of free energies between the folded global, minimal energy structure in the segment and its corresponding optimal, restrained structure (ORS) where all the previous base pairings in the lowest free energy structure are forbidden. Using a standard z-score, SigZscr, we can estimate the behavior of E_diff in the real biological segment and make a robust statistical inference based on the general behavior of E_diff in the tested random sample. However, the computational complexity of EDscan and SigED is directly proportional to the cube of the scanning window length. Thus it is very compute intensive in searching the whole human genome. Since for miRNAs we are interested in relatively simple, distinct fold-back, stem-loop structures only in the search of those miRNA precursors in the genomic sequence we improved our algorithm to consider only stem-loop structures. Consequently, the new algorithms StemEd and SigStem contain all the power of EDscan and SigED, but the computational complexity was reduced to be directly proportional to the square of the window length. In addition, the predicting ability of the new method is less sensitive to the selection of the scanning window. This is especially advantageous in discovering unknown structural motifs and ncRNAs in genomic sequences.Our results and statistical test from all known miRNA precursors indicate that the statistically significant WFS detected by StemEd and SigStem in genomic sequences are coincident with known fold-back stem-loops found in the miRNA precursors. In statistical tests, we include 207 miRNA precursors of human, 208 of mouse, 187 of rat,121 of G. gallus, 78 of Drosophila melanogaster, 116 of Caenorhabditis elegans, 50 of Caenorhabditis briggsae, 92 of Arabidopsis thaliana and122 miRNA precursors of Oryza sativa.We are continuing the detailed analysis and intend to find distinct well-ordered folding patterns in other species and expect them to be potential miRNAs.C. Data mining of large dsRNA segments and RNA functional elements in sequence databases.Recent developments in the study of RNA silencing indicate that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can be used in eukaryotes to block expression of a corresponding cellular gene. In the RNAi pathway, dsRNAs serve as the initial triggers that are chopped by an ribonuclease termed \"Dicer\" and may result in aberrant mRNA. We search for the stalk-like dsRNAs in the 3\\'UTR database. The occurrence rate of the dsRNA structures in 3\\'UTRs ranges from 0.01% in plant to 0.30% in vertebrate mRNAs. These stalk-like dsRNAs are predicted to be very significant in Monte Carlo simulations and are well-determined\\' in RNA structure predictions. The distinct dsRNA structures in the database can be used to test the hypothesis for the nature of endogenous dsRNAs in the 3\\'UTR and the possibility that they can induce RNAi. We collaborated on studies of induction and suppression of RNA interference by HIV-1 with Dr. Jeang\\'s Lab. (Mol. Virol. Section, Lab of Mol. Microbio., NIAID, NIH). Our results indicate that although short interfering RNAs have been used artificially to silence viral infections, no direct evidence exists that natural viral sequences provoke such immunity in mammalian cells. Our computation discovers a series of dsRNAs of 19 base-pair sin about 500 HIV and related sequences. The conserved, naturally occurring 19 base-pair dsRNA elicits antiviral RNA interference in human cells. Interestingly, HIV has evolved a suppressor of RNA silencing embodied in its Tat protein to combat this induced RNA interference. And Tat suppresses RNA silencing through a functional abrogation of Dicer activity. Our results suggest it is the pre-processed, short, interfering siRNA, but not processing-requiring long interfering liRNA nor short hairpin shRNA, that should be the preferred consideration for inhibiting HIV-1 infections.',\n",
       " 'The GELLAB-II software system is an exploratory data analysis system for the analysis of sets of 2D electrophoretic protein gel images. It incorporates sophisticated subsystems for image acquisition, processing, database manipulation, graphics and statistical analysis. It has been applied to a variety of experimental systems in which quantitative and qualitative changes in one or more proteins among hundreds or thousands of unaltered proteins is the basic analytic problem. Keeping track of changes detected using these methods is also a major attribute of the system. A composite gel database may be \"viewed\" under different exploratory data analysis conditions and statistical differences and subtle patterns elucidated from \"slices\" of an effectively 3D database. Results can be presented in a variety of tables, plots or derived images and on workstations over wide area networks. The GELLAB-II research has resulted in a technology transfer CRADA with CSPI Scanalytics Inc. for a commercially available system GELLAB-II+ making this technology easily available to cancer researchers on inexpensive Microsoft Windows PCs (released in 1996). Such commercialization results in wider use and better support of the GELLAB-II technology than we can provide. GELLAB-II applications this period include: ongoing studies of nuclear matrix protein changes in prostate cancer to aid screening and staging of men with prostate cancer (J.Hopkins); and Rett syndrome (CDC) Robinson MK etal. Electrophoresis 1995;16:1176-83. In the prostate cancer studies, we are looking for both missing proteins as well as subtle quantitative changes in patterns on sets of proteins which correlates with experimental conditions and staging and screening of men with prostate cancer. We are also doing a similar investigation of nuclear matrix protein patterns from renal cell carcinoma. The Hopkins group\\'s prostate molecular work has identified several of the protein spots by sequence analysis and are completing studies to confirm these sequences. ',\n",
       " \"Improvements in the massively parallel genetic algorithm (GA) for RNA structure prediction are continuing. As well as the porting of the algorithm to a MIMD CRAY T3E. The addition of the annealing mutation operator has substantially improved the results and performance of the algorithm when compared to more standard predictive algorithms such as the dynamic programming algorithm. Pseudoknot prediction has also been included resulting in the ability to predict tertiary interactions. Work has also begun with apparent initial success of including heuristics which promote the formation of short range interactions in the folding process. This again appears to boost the accuracy of structural predictions when comparing results with phylogenetic data. The GA has also been partially integrated into RNA2D3D so that real time folding and the presentation of the three-dimensional RNA structures on an SGI workstation can now be followed. In addition, STRUCTURELAB, the hetergeneous RNA analysis workbench has been further enhanced in conjunction with RNA2D3D to produce the atomic coordinates of RNA structures along with the visualization of these structures. Also, further optimizations and improvements have been made to greatly enhance its capabilities and performance. Porting has also been done to other SGI workstations. We have applied the above techniques to compare secondary structure of the 5' non-coding region of poliovirus 3 RNA derived from the genetic algorithm with the standard Skinner model which demonstrated improved results over conventional techniques. Also, these techniques have been applied to understand the genetics behind, and mechanisms of, the expression of the viral cardiovirulence phenotype of the CVBs which has demonstrated novel structural elements. We have continued to study the dimerization site of HIV-1 RNA. Based on further experiments which include gel shifts, ultracentrifugation, Rnase mapping studies and computational approaches, we have characterized the binding affinity of the nucleocapsid protein NCp7 to the so-called stem-loop 1 and stem-loop 2 RNA structures. We have recently found much higher affinity to stem loop 2 through ultracentrifugation. \",\n",

       " 'The major current goal of project is to study the biochemistry and cell biology of Macrophage Stimulating Protein (MSP) and its receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RON). Investigations to date suggest that this ligand receptor pair may affect a number of cells that participate in the response to tissue injury, including skin cells, macrophages and capillary endothelium. Our major findings this year are: 1. Using time-lapse video, we found that MSP stimulates macrophage membrane ruffling and pinocytotic activity. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositol-3kinase, prevents MSP action, suggesting that PI-3K is in the signal transduction pathway. If wortmannin is added 15 min after MSP, membrane motility is not inhibited. Thus, the MSP PI-3K path is a trigger of motility events that do not require continuing stimulation via PI-3K. 2. The receptor for MSP belongs to the large family of growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinases, which are thought to be activated by ligand-induced dimerization. We found that the primary receptor binding site of the MSP alpha-beta-chain disulfide- linked heterodimer is in the beta-chain. Free beta-chain binds, but does not activate the receptor. This suggests that a secondary binding site, present in the whole molecule, is required for receptor dimerization. 3. Pro-MSP is the single chain precursor of MSP. Proteolytic cleavage of pro-MSP at a single site yields activie MSP. Peritoneal macrophages, one of the target cells of MSP, has two enzymatic activities that cleave pro-MSP. One cleaves at the activation site, the other degrades pro-MSP. Normal serum has an inhibitor of the degrading enzyme. The inhibitor was isolated and identified by N-terminal sequencing as a alpha-1-antichymotrypsin. Control of MSP activity at the locus of macrophage target cells may involve this enzyme inhibitor combination. ',\n",
       " 'Our interest continues to lie in the clinical, and genetic evaluation of families with an inherited predisposition to renal carcinoma.Genotype-phenotype correlations in the Birt-Hogg-Dub syndrome We evaluated 63 families affected with the Birt-Hogg-Dub syndrome for germline mutations in the BHD gene, and for clinical manifestations of the disease. We detected germline mutations in 52 63 (83%) of the BHD families. A mutation \"hot spot\" was located in a cytosine homonucleotide tract. Deletion or addition of a single nucleotide at this cytosine homonucleotide tract accounted for about half of the germline mutations in the BHD gene. All germline mutations that we detected were predicted to truncate the BHD protein. No missense mutations were detected. We looked for correlations between specific germline BHD mutations and the penetrance of renal cell carcinoma. Patients with germline mutations at the cytosine homonucleotide tract comprised the largest group of patients with identical mutations. There was a difference in the frequency of renal cell carcinoma in patients with a C insertion compared to a C deletion at the cytosine homonucleotide tract. Renal tumors were more common in men compared to women and usually occurred after age 40.Biochemical studies of the Birt-Hogg-Dub syndrome protein, folliculin No homology to other human proteins was found although folliculin was conserved across species. This fact prompted us to perform an in depth study to determine the normal function of folliculin. As a first step, we measured the expression of BHD mRNA in normal and neoplastic tissues. There was a wide expression pattern in many tissues including skin, lung and kidney. Folliculin was located in the cytoplasm by cell fractionation and fluorescence studies. A folliculin-binding protein was identified by immunoprecipitation and by mass spectrometry.The BHD gene is a tumor suppressor Our collaborators, Cathy Vocke and Marston Linehan, have detected consistent inactivation, by point mutation, of the wild-type copy of the BHD gene in renal tumors from patients affected with the Birt-Hoog- Dub syndrome. This data provides strong support for the idea that the BHD gene is a tumor suppressor.Studies of families affected with Familial Renal Carcinoma We have recruited patients families with two or more individuals affected with renal carcinoma by a mailing to urologists and medical oncologists. Field trips have been made to several of these families to obtain informed consent, clinical information and a blood sample. We are working together with Joan Bailey-Wilson, statistical geneticist in our studies of these families. We are determining whether Familial Renal Carcinoma is homogeneous in terms of renal tumor pathology and what the empiric risk for renal tumor development is in at-risk family members. We are also testing whether renal tumors from members of FRC families have somatic VHL mutations, and evaluating the distribution of renal carcinoma risk factors.Identification of families affected with Hereditary Leiomyoma Renal Cell Carcinoma Evaluation of the Familial Renal Carcinoma families requires removing families with known forms of inherited renal cell carcinoma. We found several families who had germline mutations in the fumarate hydratase gene among our panel of families considered to have Familial Renal Carcinoma.Studies of case-control populations affected with renal carcinoma We are planning collaborative studies on case-control populations affected with renal carcinoma with Dr. Lee Moore and Dr. Wong Ho Chow. These studies will include testing of renal tumors for somatic VHL mutationsCollaborative studies with Steven Hou on homologs of folliculin We are evaluating the normal function of the Drosophila homolog of the human BHD gene and the normal function of the folliculin-binding proteins.',\n",
       " 'Background outline: Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (TSG) play a central role in causation and development of human cancer and provide the means to predict, detect, early diagnose and treat cure human malignancies. The products of these cancer-causing genes are components of signal transduction circuits that control embryonic development, cellular proliferation and or apoptotic death. Knowledge of these signaling pathways allows to identify molecular markers that herald the onset of cancer development and to predict response to treatment and clinical outcome. The development of tumors from incipient malignant cells to metastases is driven by Darwinian expansion of clonal cell populations involving additional mutated cancer genes. Every tumor tissue contains a minute population of tumor stem cells with self-renewal capacity essential for both tumor maintenance and spread. Fundamentally, these immortal tumor cells finally determine the response to treatment and tumor recurrence. Our research program began in 1987 and culminated in the identification in 1993 of the VHL TSG located at 3p25. In 1993-2003 we investigated the sequence structure of the VHL gene and identified and analyzed VHL target genes. In parallel we intensified research on mapping and molecular cloning of TSG located on 3p21.3 involved in the origin and or development of major forms of lung cancer and other common carcinomas. In 2003-2004 we investigated: (1) the methylation code of the VHL locus itself and the function of VHL target genes (carbonic anhydrases, CA9 and CA12, the transcription regulator STRA13 and other VHL relay genes, STAT1 and TIEG1); (2) continued deletion mapping in 3p21.3 by real time PCR in tumor tissues and cell lines; and (3) completed the isolation and initial characterization of candidate cancer-causing genes from both 3p21.3 regions (centromeric, LUCA, and telomeric, AP20). These 3p21.3 regions should be considered contiguous cancer gene regions harboring clusters of TSG.We then focused our research on functional analysis (finding interacting proteins, analyzing null mutants in mice, and bioinformatics annotations) of some of the strong candidate genes.VHL TSG (3p25) Using the VHL locus as a model system, we investigated the mechanisms of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer. We also aimed to use epigenetic codes (CpG and H3 H4 histone codes) to understand whether they harbor variations associated with inter-individual familial differences that may determine risk of sporadic VHL type cancers. We produced detailed and contiguous \"bisulfite-sequencing\" profiles of the human and mouse VHL loci (17 and 6.7 kb respectively) to reveal CpG codes in addition to H3 H4 histone methylation profiles. In VHL-expressing cells, only the promoter CpG island is protected and free from methylation while the rest of the locus is heavily methylated. This methylation pattern was re-created de novo and maintained on the human genomic VHL transgene during development of transgenic mice. Somatic cells were also able to preserve the pre-existing methylation pattern after fusion in somatic cell hybrids and after human-to-mouse single chromosome 3 transfer. We found that CTCF a ubiquitous chromatin DNA binding protein has binding sites in human and mouse VHL CpG promoter islands and may play an important role in protecting against aberrant silencing of the gene in kidney cancer. We will now focus on the identification of other protecting cis elements and binding proteins in the VHL locus and on studies of the VHL epigenetic code variations.We discovered that CA 9 CA12 genes are specifically induced and over-expressed in many tumor types. These enzymes may control the acidic tumor microenvironment and should be considered molecular targets for development of new treatment modalities. Using purified CAIX XII enzymes we tested novel and classical (clinically used for glaucoma treatment) aromatic sulfonamide inhibitors that may have potent anti-tumor activity. We identified among them several compounds that showed nanomolar inhibition specific for each enzyme. We aim now to initiate clinical trials with the FDA approved compounds. Our computer modeling studies of the enzyme-inhibitor interactions showed the affinity for each carbonic anhydrase correlates with how well the inhibitor fills the spatial volume of the inhibitor-binding pocket. This specificity is promising for the design of even more potent agents with reduced toxicity.The STRA13 transcription factor is negatively controlled by the VHL gene and induced by hypoxia, a condition prevalent in cancer tissues. We discovered that STRA13 binds to and modulates the activity of the powerful regulator of transcription STAT3 that is fundamentally involved in regulating cancer cell growth and survival and embryonic and probably cancer stem cell self-renewal. Importantly STRA13 is also involved in regulating acquired immunity. Our characterization of the STRA13 protein network is broadening the spectrum of potential therapeutic targets and expands our knowledge of the VHL carcinogenic pathway(s). Hypoxia and transforming growth factor -beta1 (TGF-beta 1) play important roles in regulation of the immune system, cell adhesion, migration, and tissue remodeling. Using TGF-beta1 BMP cDNA arrays and RNA isolated from CCRCC cell lines with different VHL status we outlined a set of targets common for pVHL and TGF-beta1 pathways. We associated one of these targets, the hypoxia-inducible Kruppel-like zinc finger transcriptional factor TIEG1, with transcriptional regulation of pVHL hypoxia targets CA12, TGFBi, PAI-1, and others. We also showed that transcriptional modulation of another novel pVHL target, STAT1, is mediated via STRA13, which was previously implicated in both pVHL HIF and TGF-beta1 pathways. These results provide novel insights on transcriptional cooperation between the pVHL HIF, TGF-beta1, and JAK STAT pathways and emphasize a new mechanism that employs relay genes to amplify and diversify the original primary hypoxia signal. In addition, these findings will provide a rapid and accurate identification of drug targets and tumor markers with true potential. The 3p21.3 TSG Functional studies on the 3p21.3 tumor suppressor genes: We used the yeast two-hybrid system, controlled expression of trangenes in tumor cells, targeted inactivation in mice (mouse knockout models), and bioinformatics to discover the function of the resident putative TSG.We identified the RASSF1A gene as a multiple TSG involved in many tumors, including lung, breast, prostate, kidney, head and neck, uterine cervix and others. We hypothesize that RASSF1 genes and their paralogs are inactivated in approximately 70% of human cancers.The HYAL2 protein was identified as a GPI-anchored receptor for the sheep lung cancer retrovirus, JSRV, and a sequestration mechanism inactivating HYAL2 protein was demonstrated. The env gene of JSRV was shown to transform human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro and sequester the HYAL2 protein. The absence of HYAL2 (mediated either by a putative virus or mutational inactivation) leads to ligand-independent activation of the RON receptor tyrosine kinase and its downstream signaling pathways (Akt and MAPK).We have been also studying the involvement of RON in SCLC. We discovered that in SCLC the promoter of RON is silenced by hypermethylation leading to simultaneous activation of a putative internal promoter. The novel transcript originating from this internal promoter encodes mostly the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor that is constitutively activated and may drive cell proliferation. Thus RON is emerging as a potential oncogenic factor in lung cancer and a target for therapeutic intervention.',\n",
       " 'Many essential cellular functions require the action of molecular chaperones. Chaperones function during non-stress conditions to facilitate folding of newly synthesized proteins, to remodel protein complexes, and to target for degradation regulatory proteins and misfolded proteins. During cell stress, chaperones play an essential role in preventing the appearance of folding intermediates that lead to irreversibly damaged and aggregated proteins. They promote recovery from stress by disaggregating and reactivating proteins, a process not long ago thought to be impossible. They are also involved in delivering damaged proteins to compartmentalized proteases. Protein aggregation and misfolding are primary contributors to a large number of human diseases, including Alzheimers, Parkinsons, type II diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and prion diseases. Understanding how chaperones function and how they interact with proteases will provide the foundation for discovering cures and preventions for the devastating diseases caused by protein misfolding, premature degradation, and formation of toxic protein aggregates. Our previous work showed that Escherichia coli ClpA, an AAA+ protein and the regulatory component of ClpAP protease, has molecular chaperone activity. This work and the work of others demonstrated that Clp ATPases comprise a family of ATP-dependent chaperones. Two members of the Clp family, ClpB of prokaryotes and Hsp104 of yeast, collaborate with DnaK Hsp70 and DnaJ Hsp40 to rescue insoluble aggregated proteins. However, the mechanisms of protein disaggregation by ClpB and Hsp104 remain unclear. Our recent studies support a mechanism in which polypeptides are extracted from aggregates by forcible unfolding and translocation. We showed that both proteins have the intrinsic ability to disaggregate some aggregates independent of the Hsp70 DnaKsystem. The products of disaggregation are unfolded polypeptides. The innate disaggregating and unfolding activities of both ClpB and Hsp104 are elicited in vitro by using mixtures of ATP and ATPgammaS (a slowly hydrolyzed and nonphysiological ATP analog) or by the use of mutants with defective ATP hydrolytic activity. It is likely that these in vitro conditions allow the substrate to be held (a process requiring ATP binding but not hydrolysis) and, at the same time, unfolded (a process requiring ATP hydrolysis). Because ClpB Hsp104 acts in conjunction with the DnaK Hsp70 system in vivo, these results suggest that one role of the DnaK Hsp70 chaperone system is to synchronize substrate holding and unfolding by ClpB Hsp104. To gain insight into the individual roles of ClpB and the DnaK system in protein remodeling we tested whether there was a further stimulation by the DnaK chaperone system under conditions that promoted protein remodeling by ClpB alone. Our results demonstrated that ClpB and the DnaK system act synergistically to remodel proteins and dissolve aggregates, implying that ATPgammaS does not simply mimic the function of the DnaK Hsp70 system. We have also been investigating how another Clp protein, ClpX, acts with a proteolytic component, ClpP, in regulating cell division. FtsZ is the major cytoskeletal protein in bacteria and a tubulin homolog. It polymerizes into filaments at the cell midline where constriction occurs to divide the cell into two daughter cells. We have found that both FtsZ monomers and filaments are degraded by ClpXP in vivo and in vitro. Our results suggest that ClpXP modulates FtsZ assembly and disassembly via regulation of the equilibrium between free and polymeric FtsZ through degradation of FtsZ. Ongoing studies of the E. coli DnaK chaperone and its two co-chaperones, DnaJ and GrpE have been aimed at understanding the function of CbpA, a DnaJ homolog, and its regulation by CbpM. We have shown that in vitro CbpA has cochaperone activity and forms a physical complex with CbpM. Both in vitro and in vivo the activity of CbpA is inhibited by CbpM as a consequence of the interaction. These results reveal that the activity of the DnaK system can be regulated in vivo by the expression of an inhibitor specific for one of the components.',\n",
       " \"Gottesman Project Title We have focused our studies on two types of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, regulation of mRNA degradation and translation by small regulatory RNAs and regulation of protein stability by energy-dependent proteases. RpoS, a central stress response regulator in Escherichia coli, is subject to both of these levels of control. Degradation of RpoS requires ClpXP protease, and RssB, a protein that presents RpoS to the protease. Degradation is signaled by phosphorylation of RssB; we are investigating the mechanism of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. However, recent studies demonstrated significant regulation of degradation in the absence of phosphorylation, suggesting a novel method of regulation that needs to be understood. Deletion analysis of RssB indicates that sequences at the C-terminus are critical for proper release of the substrate to the protease; N-terminal sequences are required for interaction with the protease. RpoS translation is positively regulated by at least two small RNAs. The message upstream of the RpoS translation start folds into a hairpin that occludes ribosome binding and therefore translation. The small regulatory RNAs, DsrA and RprA, compete for the inhibitory stem of the hairpin, disrupting the secondary structure of the RpoS leader, allowing translation. The promoter of dsrAis regulated by temperature ; we have previously shown that regulation resides in a minimal promoter region, with the -10 region playing a critical role. RprA, identified as a multicopy suppressor of dsrAmutants, is regulated by the RcsC, RcsD, RcsB phosphorelay regulatory system. These regulators also act to turn up capsular polysaccharide synthesis and to up regulate a cell division protein as well as many other genes, some involved in biofilm formation; they are activated by cell surface stress. Genetic studies have demonstrated that sensing to activate the phosphorelay is usually via modification of the activity or structure of RcsF, a lipoprotein that acts upstream of the membrane sensor, RcsC. Two additional small RNAs that appear to regulate RpoS are under study. Finally, some novel levels of regulation of translation of RpoS have been found that are independent of small RNAs. Both tmRNA, an RNA that is used at stalled ribosomes to tag the peptide for degradation and relieve the stalling, and the miaA-directed RNA modification are necessary for high levels of RpoS translation. Thus, a variety of cellular systems affect RpoS levels. A genome-wide search for conserved small RNAs was carried out in collaboration with Gisela Storz's laboratory in NICHD. We have investigated the roles and regulation for a number of the small RNAs found in that search. The best-studied of these is RyhB. RyhB transcription is repressed by the Fur, iron-dependent repressor, and the small RNA is therefore made in high quantities when intracellular iron is limiting. When it is made, it targets multiple mRNAs for degradation. The target mRNAs encode either iron storage proteins (ferritins) or iron-containing but non-essential metabolic proteins. Therefore, this small RNA, which is also found in Vibrio, Salmonella, Klebsiella, and Yersinia, reprograms iron use in the cells and may be an important component of virulence for some pathogens. Using the properties of RyhB, we collaborated with Dr. David Fitzgerald and Dr. Peter Fitzgerald at NCI as well as Dr. Michael Vasil in Colorado to demonstrate that similar small RNAs regulate genes encoding iron-containing proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although the sequences of the regulatory RNAs are very different. In further studies on RyhB, we demonstrated that both RyhB and its target mRNAs are rapidly degraded, dependent upon an essential endonuclease, RNase E. Degradation of the small RNA was only rapid when transcription of other genes was active, suggesting that pairing with mRNA targets was critical for degradation of the small RNA. Based on the studies of RyhB, we were able to show that two other small RNAs of this class, DsrA and OxyS, were also unstable when transcription was active but stable when it was inactive; this is probably a general property of these small RNAs. Two other small RNAs from this search, RygA and RygB, have been found to regulate a number of outer membrane proteins; these small RNAs are made after osmotic shock and appear to be part of the OmpR EnvZ regulon. In a continued collaboration with Dr. Gisela Storz's laboratory, we used the ability of the RNA chaperone Hfq to bind tightly to many small RNAs to identify yet more small RNAs in E. coli. Hfq was immunoprecipitated, the bound RNA isolated and used to probe microarrays. At least six additional small RNAs were identified with another 6-10 likely; all use Hfq, which suggests that they act by pairing with target mRNAs. One of these, originally called RyaA and now renamed SgrS, has been studied in some detail. SgrS is made when cells accumulate glucose-6-phosphate or a phosphorylated glucose analog. The sugar phosphate is made when glucose is transported into the cells by the glucose PTS transporter; the glucose-specific gene is encoded by ptsG. Work by H. Aiba and colleagues had demonstrated that when further metabolism is blocked, the accumulation of the sugar phosphate is toxic and cells respond by degrading the mRNA for ptsG. We find that this is mediated by SgrS, which is predicted to pair with the ptsG 5' UTR. SgrS induction depends on a novel transcriptional regulator, encoded by the divergent gene, yabN , renamed by us sgrR . The SgrR protein may directly sense the accumulation of sugar phosphate. When either the small RNA or the transcriptional regulator are mutant, cells are unable to recover from glucose-phosphate accumulation. The action of DsrA and RprA in positive regulation of RpoS translation is rather unique and raised the question whether pairing simply opens a hairpin or has effects on the processing or stability of the target mRNA and the small RNA. Using previously tested mutations and compensating mutations in the small RNAs and the target messages to provide specificity, we can show that small RNA pairing with the rpoS message results in higher levels of the message, and also seems to stabilize the small RNAs. Further studies on this should increase our understanding of positive action of small RNAs. \",\n",
       " \"Our research goal is to understand the molecular structure and function of the genes that play critical roles in normal growth and differentiation, neoplastic transformation, and apoptosis in mouse and human tissues and tumors of the hematopoietic system. We study oncogenes, c-myc, v-raf and v-abl; anti-oncogenes, esp. the bcl-2 family; cell cycle-regulating proteins (cyclins) and their inhibitors, p21 (waf) and p16; as well as molecules that transduce signals within the cell, e.g., protein kinase C (PKC). We and others have shown that the deregulated expression of c-myc secondary to chromosomal translocations in the c-myc region is an essential element in the series of genetic alterations that are involved in plasmacytomagenesis in BALB c mice and in Burkitt and AIDS-associated lymphomas in man. We have also shown that c-myc can also be dysregulated in these tumor cells by retroviral insertion of strong enhancers in myc's upstream flank. It is not known why BALB c mice are particularly susceptible to these genetic insults, but we have a candidate mechanism. We have found that the BALB c mouse has an unusual defect in a special form of excision repair of DNA damage. This form of excision repair is unusual in that it is not coupled to RNA transcription, which is usual for DNA excision repair. Furthermore, the defect is only manifest in repair of DNA damage in the c-myc, Pvt1, switch Ig alpha and Ig kappa genes, namely the sites of recurrent chromosomal translocation in B-lymphocytic neoplasms. This is a plausible mechanism for the production of the gene-specific, strain-specific genomic instability that predisposes to the chromosome translocations that lead to constitutive expression of c-myc. This overexpression of c-myc, in turn, leads to an extension of gene-specific genetic instability to a new subset of genes, including cyclin D2. This gene becomes amplified and overexpressed in the face of c-myc overexpression, contributing to cell proliferation. We have produced a recombinant retrovirus that expresses v-abl and c-myc (ABL-MYC). This virus rapidly induces plasmacytomas in vitro and in vivo in BALB c, nude and other strains of mice. This technology has been used to produce monoclonal antibodies to parasites, particulate, protein and peptide antigens, and it offers an alternative to hybridoma technology. We have shown that this combination of oncogenes is unique in that it permits differentiation of B cells into plasma cells in the absence of T-cell help and without ip pristane. Because T cells are not necessary in the induction of plasmacytomas with this retrovirus, we were able to show that normal T cells actually retard the emergence of these tumors. We have cloned eight PKC isozymes into expression vectors and produced cell lines that overexpress each of these isoforms in a variety of hematopoietic cell lines. Plasmacytomas are usually IL-6-dependent in vivo and in vitro, and withdrawal of IL-6 leads to their death by apoptosis. This process of apoptosis can be delayed by activating PKC-d with a specific phorbol ester. PKC-delta is also able to mediate macrophage differentiation in promyelocytes and cytoskeleton- mediated changes in the shape of B lymphocytes. We wished to determine which portion of the PKC-delta protein determines its isozyme-specific functions by constructing expression vectors that overexpress chimeric molecules that are half PKC-delta and half PKC-epsilon. The overexpression of these chimeras in different cell types showed that the C-terminal half, containing the catalytic domain, appears to bear most of the isoform-specific determinants of myeloid differentiation and transformation. \",\n",
       " 'The cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) is a DNA binding protein from Escherichia coli that can activate transcription when bound to specific sites located near promoters. CRP can serve as a model system for the study of gene regulation. We have been studying several steps in the pathway to CRP activation of transcription. (i) In order for CRP to become activated as a DNA binding protein, cAMP must bind to the protein and cause an allosteric change. We have isolated CRP mutants that are defective in the cAMP-induced allosteric change. We are initiating a collaboration with Richard Brennan at the Oregon Health Sciences University, for X-ray crystallographic analysis of one of the CRP mutants. (ii) We have found that the molecular chaperone DnaK aids in achieving CRP stability in vivo. This result may partially explain why CRP-mediated transcription activation is always greater in vivo than in vitro. (iii) We have addressed the mechanism for transcription activation by CRP by three different approaches. A previous model for CRP activation of transcription stated that CRP activated by placing the a subunit of RNA polymerase down on the DNA in a particular manner. By constructing a promoter with both CRP binding sites and an a binding site, we have shown that CRP activation of transcription is independent of a placement on DNA. We have isolated mutations in the crp gene that allow CRP to activate transcription from a longer distance from the promoter, and are currently analyzing them. Also, we have continued our studies on transcription activation on DNA that has a disruption between where CRP binds and the promoter. This disrupted DNA does not allow CRP activation of transcription because unwinding of the DNA at the promoter does not occur. We have also developed a protein footprinting assay that allows identification of regions within a protein involved in interacting with DNA or other proteins. ',\n",
       " '1) Mechanism of transcription regulation. Adenine at -11 position of a TATA element a promoter is critical and sufficient to signal base pair deformation. The conserved A: T base pair at the -11 position of the promoters in Escherichia coli is very sensitive to substitutions. In vitro transcription with the galP1 promoter having a natural or unnatural base in either strand at position -11 showed that only a purine base with no side group at C2 in the nontemplate strand is transcriptionally potent; neither a purine with amino group at C2 nor a pyrimidine support transcription. The amino group at C6 in the omnipresent adenine at -11 does not play any role in promoting transcription. The nature of the base, complementary or noncomplementary, at -11 in the template strand also does not influence transcription. We proposed that the adenine, by becoming extrahelical, interacts with an amino acid(s) of the 2.3-2.4 region of sigma for which an unsubstituted C2 hydrogen is critical. 2) Effect of varying supercoiling on transcription and its regulation. The effect of superhelicity of DNA templates on transcription is well documented in several cases. However, the amount of supercoiling that is needed to bring about any changes and the steps at which such effects are exerted were not systemically studied. We investigated the effect of DNA supercoiling on transcription from a set of promoters present on a plasmid by using a series of topoisomers with different superhelical densities ranging from totally relaxed to more than physiological. In vitro transcription assays with these topoisomers in the absence and presence of gene regulatory proteins showed that the effect of negative supercoiling on intrinsic transcription varies from promoter to promoter. Some of the promoters, in which DNA superhelicity stimulated transcription, displayed specific optima of superhelical density while others did not. The results also showed that the amount of abortive RNA synthesis from two of the promoters decreased and full-length RNA increased with increasing supercoiling, indicating for the first time an inverse relationship between full-length and abortive RNA synthesis and supporting a role of DNA superhelicity in promoter clearance. DNA supercoiling might also influence the point of RNA chain termination. Furthermore, the effect of varying the amount of supercoiling on the action of gene regulatory proteins suggested the mode of action, which is consistent with previous results. Our results underscore the importance of DNA supercoiling in fine-tuning promoter activities, which should be relevant in cell physiology given that local changes in chromosomal supercoiling must occur in different environments. 3) Interaction of adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP receptor protein. We have investigated the possibility that adenylate cyclase makes physical contact with the receptor protein for efficient delivery of cyclic AMP for activation of transcription from a promoter. By using purified His-tagged adenylate cyclase and CRP and employing Nickel column, we have demonstrated a physical interaction between the two proteins. This was further confirmed by co-immuno precipitation assays. We are currently investigating the biochemical properties of this complex. Bacterial Chromosome Structure. 1) A-tract cluster facilitates DNA condensation in chromosome. Molecular mechanisms of bacterial chromosome packaging are still unclear, as bacteria lack nucleosomes or other apparent basic elements of DNA compaction. Among the factors facilitating DNA condensation may be propensity of the DNA molecule for folding due to its intrinsic curvature. As suggested previously, the sequence correlations in genome reflect such a propensity [Trifonov and Sussman (1980) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 77, 3816-3820].',\n",
       " \"I. To understand the mechanisms by which the thyroid hormone, 3, 3', 5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3), promotes growth, differentiation and development, we have been studying the structure, function and regulation of the human beta1 thyroid hormone receptor (h-TRbeta1). (a) One critical question is how the tissue-specific expression of TRs is regulated. Using okadaic acid (OA) as a tool, we found that activation of the phosphorylation of TRbeta1 led to an induction of its expression which was not found in TR subtype beta2 or alpha1 (TRalpha1). Furthermore, the OA-induced TRb1 expression is cell-type dependent. This induction was due to an increase in the stability of TRb1 protein conferred by phosphorylation. This is the first report to indicate that one of the mechanisms by which the TR isoforms are differentially expressed is via the tissue-specific stabilization of TRb1. (b) The transcriptional activity of TRs is T3-dependent. We carried out mutational analysis to identify the site(s) in TRb1 which are critical to this function. We identified Glu252 as an important residue in transmitting the hormonal signal from the T3 binding domain to the DNA binding domain to affect the gene regulating activity of TRb1. These findings have advanced our understanding of the molecular basis of T3-dependent transcriptional activation. (c) It is unclear whether the two TR isoforms, TRa1 and TRb1, have differential biological activities. We constructed a series of chimeric TRs in which the different domains were sequentially interchanged and their DNA binding activities were evaluated. For the first time, we found that the two TR isoforms have differential activities which were mediated by interplay of their domains. This serves as an important regulatory mechanism to achieve diversity and specificity of pleiotropic T3 effect. II. To understand the molecular basis of the genetic disease, resistance to thyroid hormones (RTH), we evaluated the nature and role of the wild type TRb1 (wTRb1) mutant heterodimers in RTH. We found that there was a strong correlation between the formation of TRb1 mutant and the dominant negative potency of mutants. Thus, wTRb1 mutant heterodimers could play an important role in RTH. \",\n",
       " ' We have developed an immunotoxin SS1P that targets ovarian cancers, mesotheliomas and pancreatic cancers that is currently in clinical trials. We are carrying out laboratory experiments to produce improved forms of SS1P that are less immunogenic so that several treatment cycles can be given. We have also investigated how to improve the activity of SS1P against solid tumors and found that if chemotherapy is give before SS1P there is profound synergy. We are investigating the mechanism of this synergy. We have studied mesothelin expression in lung cancer and demonstrated lung cancer cells are good targets for SS1P therapy. We have produced less immunogenic immunotoxins by mutating amino acids on the surface of PE38 to alenine or glycine. We are determining the pathway that toxins use to induce apoptosis. ',\n",
       " 'We have been interested in defining the major mechanisms of simultaneous resistance of cancer cells to multiple chemotherapeutic agents. One major mechanism is expression of an energy-dependent efflux pump, termed P-glycoprotein (P-gp), or the multidrug transporter, encoded in humans by the MDR1 gene. The sequence of the MDR1 cDNA led to a model of the transporter as a pump with 12 transmembrane domains and 2 ATP sites; determination of the domains of P-gp responsible for substrate binding and coupling of ATPase activity to substrate transport are the major goals of our work. Model systems based on stable expression or transient expression of mutated P-gps by a vaccinia virus expression system have been developed to assay functional effects of these mutations on drug binding, drug-dependent ATPase, drug resistance and drug transport. Substitution of all known phosphorylation sites in P-gp with either Ala or Asp does not affect ability of P-gp to confer multidrug resistance. The creation of bicistronic retroviral expression vectors able to confer multidrug resistance has enabled the development of vectors for treatment of other genetic diseases such as Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, chronic granulomatous disease, X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency and adenosine deaminase deficiency. In these vectors, P-gp serves as a dominant selectable marker. These vectors may be delivered to bone marrow stem cells grown ex vivo or complexed to liposomes in vivo. We have also begun to explore the mechanism of multidrug resistance resulting from selection in cisplatin of hepatoma cells and KB adenocarcinoma cells. Cisplatin-resistant hepatoma and KB cells are cross-resistant to methotrexate, arsenite and antimonite and accumulate reduced amounts of these three toxic agents. ',\n",
       " 'Our laboratory seeks to elucidate the complex molecular genetic program governing tumor genesis and progression through the development and analysis of genetically engineered mouse models of human cancer. A major goal is to identify candidate targets or pathways for both mechanistic enlightenment and therapeutic utility. Our efforts in this regard are focused on two tumor types, cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) and the pediatric malignancy rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Exposure to UV radiation is a causal agent in the vast majority of CMM. Retrospective epidemiological data have suggested that CMM is provoked by intense but intermittent exposure to UV, particularly during childhood. We tested this hypothesis in genetically engineered mice in which the receptor tyrosine kinase c-MET was deregulated by virtue of ectopic expression of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor scatter factor (HGF SF). We discovered that a single neonatal dose of burning UV radiation in these mice was necessary and sufficient to induce tumors reminiscent of human CMM (Noonan et al., Nature 413: 271-2, 2001). A critical role for the INK4a ARF locus, widely regarded as a key melanoma suppressor in human patients, was confirmed in our mouse model by demonstrating that UV-induced melanoma was significantly accelerated on a genetic background deficient in Ink4a Arf (Recio et al., Cancer Res. 62: 6724-30, 2002). These results strongly suggest that sunburn is a highly significant risk factor in kindreds harboring germline mutations in INK4a ARF (Merlino and Noonan, Trends Mol. Med. 9: 102-8, 2003). There has been much controversy surrounding the relative risks associated with UVB versus UVA radiation. We used the HGF SF transgenic mouse to show that UVB, but not UVA, alone is able to induce the full melanoma phenotype (DeFabo et al., Cancer Res. 64: 6372-6, 2004). Preliminary data now suggest that UV-induced mouse melanoma can by prevented by SPF15 sunscreen, demonstrating the potential value of this model system for the development of more effective melanoma prevention strategies.The childhood malignancy RMS, accounting for up to 10% of all pediatric neoplasms and for more than 50% of pediatric soft tissue sarcomas, is believed to arise from imbalances in skeletal muscle cell proliferation and differentiation. However, molecular pathways associated with RMS are poorly understood, due in part to the lack of an RMS-prone animal model. We have discovered that virtually all HGF SF transgenic, Ink4a Arf-deficient mutant mice rapidly succumbed to highly invasive RMS (Sharp et al., Nature Med. 8: 1276-80, 2002). Comparable molecular lesions have also been described for human RMS. These data provide genetic evidence that c-MET and INK4a ARF pathways represent critical and synergistic targets in RMS pathogenesis, and suggest a rational therapeutic combination to combat this pediatric cancer. We have generated highly and poorly metastatic cell lines from the RMS tumors arising in our HGF SF-transgenic, Ink4a Arf-deficient mice, which have been a valuable tool for identifying genes regulating metastasis. cDNA microarray analysis has identified a set of genes whose expression was significantly different between highly and poorly metastatic cells. Functional in vivo studies confirmed that the cytoskeletal linker Ezrin and the homeodomain-containing transcription factor Six1 have essential roles in determining the metastatic fate of RMS cells (Yu et al., Nature Med. 10: 175-81). Notably, EZRIN and SIX1 expression levels were also enhanced in human RMS tissue, significantly correlating with clinical stage. Subsequent analyses showed that the Ezrin gene was a direct transcriptional target of Six1, and indispensable for Six1-induced metastasis (manuscript under review).',\n",

       " 'Interaction between RNAP and stringently controlled promoters: Under optimal growth conditions, rapidly dividing E. coli cells transcribe a set of genes at a very high rate. These genes engage most of the RNAP molecules in the cell, although they constitute only a small fraction of the genome. In contrast, nutrition- limiting conditions, such as amino acid starvation, cause a rapid accumulation of the guanine derivative, ppGpp, and a dramatic reduction in expression of these genes, a process termed the stringent response. We found that there is a common functional feature of stringently controlled promoters. The interactions between RNAP and this class of promoters are intrinsically unstable and the stability of the complexes between RNAP and stringently controlled promoters is influenced greatly by the superhelicity of DNA template. In addition, we found that four mutant RNAPs appear specifically to destabilize further the interactions with this class of promoters. The behavior of these RNAP mutants with a supercoiled DNA mimics that of wild-type RNAP with a relaxed DNA for stringently controlled promoters, like \"stringent\" RNAPs. From our study, we propose that modulation of the instability of the RNAP-stringent promoter complexes is the key element regulating this class of promoters during the stringent response, and that transcription and the stability of initiation complexes at stringently controlled promoters are coupled through modulation in superhelicity. Interaction between core RNAP and sigma factors: Since the binding of core RNAP with different sigma factors is, operationally, the first step in transcription initiation, it is a critical step in controlling global gene expression. Starting with the studies on the basis for suppression of a temperature sensitive rpoD800 mutant by several rpoH mutations, a collaboration with Dr. Richard Calendar, Univ. of California, Berkeley, we have developed powerful genetic approaches to studying RNAP and sigma factors interaction. We found that almost all of these rpoH suppressors are defective in binding to core RNAP. These rpoH mutations are located in conserved regions 3, 4.2 and RpoH box of sigma-32. Thus, our study demonstrated that multiple regions on sigma-32 affect core RNAP binding. We also found that some of the rpoH mutations are conditionally lethal in the rpoD+ strain. We took advantage of this phenotype to isolate large numbers of temperature-resistant suppressors of these rpoH mutants. We found that some suppressor mutations are mapped either in the rpoB or rpoC genes, encoding the beta and beta\\' subunit of RNAP, respectively. Identification of a novel RNA-associated protein, RapA: Using a modified procedure for purification of RNAP, we identified a new RNAP-associated protein named RapA. It is a homolog of the SWI2 SNF2 family of eukaryotic proteins. We found that the RapA protein is an integral component of RNAP. We purified the RapA protein from RNAP to homogeneity and found that RapA forms a stable complex with the RNAP holoenzyme as if it were a subunit of RNAP. In addition, RapA is an ATPase, and the ATPase activity is stimulated when it is bound to RNAP; the latter by itself has little or no ATPase activity in this assay. Thus, RapA interacts with RNAP both physically and functionally. ',\n",
       " '<b>Protein structure< b> Finding homologous proteins is becoming increasingly more important because the most effective procedure for gathering information on the function of the product of a newly discovered gene is to find a homologous protein for which some functional information is available. Homology searches are also an essential step in establishing phylogenetic relations among different genes. Homology searches usually require using a tool such as BLAST to identify sequence alignments with sufficiently high score. Obviously, the sensitivity and specificity of the search depends critically on the score matrix used. The score matrices commonly used today are based on amino acid substitution frequencies derived from sequence alignments alone; the structural information is not used even when such information is available for some of the homologous proteins. However, it is well known that amino acid substitution patterns depend heavily on the structural context. For example, an amino acid is most likely to be substituted by a non-polar residue if it is buried in the protein structure, but by a polar residue if exposed to the solvent. When many homologous sequences can be found using a conventional score matrix, then a position-specific score matrix (PSSM or profile) can be set up, which implicitly includes structural information. The PSI-BLAST program, which builds and uses PSSM in iterative fashion, greatly extends the power of BLAST to find more homologous sequences. However, when many homologous sequences cannot be found by using the conventional score matrix, or when all sequences found are highly sequence-similar, an effective profile cannot be constructed and PSI-BLAST loses its power. One may expect that sensitivity and specificity of the search would increase in such cases if the structural context effect were included directly in the amino acid substitution score matrix. We proved that such is indeed the case by developing the Context-Specific Score Matrices (CSSM) and demonstrating their power in finding more homologous sequences once the structure of one protein is known. The construction of CSSMs requires a large set of accurately aligned protein sequences. We used sequence alignments that were obtained by superposition of three-dimensional structures by a structure comparison program. Such structure-based sequence alignment has been considered the most accurate of all sequence alignment methods. However, we found recently that sequence alignments produced by different structure comparison programs contain varying degrees of error when compared to the manually procured alignments in NCBIs (National Center for Biotechnology Information) Conserved Domain Database. We are in the process of studying algorithms that will produce the most accurate structure-based sequence alignment. <b>Immunotoxin< b> One problem with the immunotoxins is that the patient, when exposed to it, develops neutralizing antibodies. In an attempt to identify the epitopes and perhaps eliminate them, Pastans group generated 60 mouse monoclonal antibodies and quantitatively determined all-against-all pair-wise competition in binding to the immunotoxin. On the basis of this data, they could group the antibodies into 7 to 13 groups and interpreted the result as indicating that there are only 7 to 13 major epitopes against which all the monoclonal antibodies respond. We validated this remarkable interpretation by means of a simple mathematical model for random competitive binding on the surface of the immunotoxin molecule. The validation used a new ROC (Receiver-Operator Characteristic) curve-based method, similar to the method we used for protein structure classification studies. <b>Gene discovery< b> A goal of this project was to find new genes that were expressed in many cancers, but only in a restricted set of non-essential normal tissues. We have set up a software tool that analyzes the genome and expressed sequence (mRNA and EST) databases to discover a large number of such genes. In the past year, we halted looking for more new genes and instead concentrated on gathering information of the product of the genes already found. POTE is one of the genes we found some time ago. The human genome contains at least 13 closely similar paralogs dispersed in 8 different chromosomes. Different paralogs are expressed in only a few normal tissues (prostate, ovary, testis and embryonic stem cells) but in numerous cancer cells and tissues. The POTE gene family is primate-specific. We found the following about this gene: (1) We identified an ancestral gene, ANKRD26, which has an ortholog in the mouse. Recently, Pastans group found that a disruption of this gene by a gene trap technique causes extreme obesity and increase in body size in homozygous mice. (2) Some POTE gene paralogs acquired an actin transposon, which inserted in-frame in an exon of the parental POTE gene. Our experimental colleagues showed that this POTE-actin chimeric gene produces the expected fused protein product. Since POTE contains ankyrin repeats, spectrin-like coiled coil region and actin in some paralogs, we expect it to be located at the cytoplasmic aspect of the membrane, connecting it to the cytoskeleton. CAPC is made of leucine-rich repeats, one putative transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail at the C-terminus. It is expressed in breast, prostate, and salivary gland as well as in many cancers. Function is unknown. A phylogenetic analysis of CAPC orthologs from mammals shows that the putative cytoplasmic tail may be subject to rapid evolution. NGEP is highly specifically expressed in prostate and many cancers. It is predicted to be an integral membrane protein, with 8 transmembrane domains. It is a promising target for an immunotoxin. <b>Comparative analysis of genes and genomes< b> Last year, we found 9 genes that have been substantially modified or inactivated by a frameshift mutation specifically in humans. We now found 9 more genes that have been modified or inactivated by a nonsense mutation and 6 others that have similarly been affected by an exon deletion mutation, all specifically only in human line. Interestingly, 6 of the 9 nonsense mutations are polymorphic in human population, suggesting that the mutations occurred rather recently and have not yet been fixed in the entire human population. Some of the interesting cases found are: NPPA: The human-specific form has a nonsense mutation near the 3-end of the coding sequence, which deletes the terminal two arginine residues in the protein product. The gene is polymorphic in human; 17% of the human chromosomes carry the original chimpanzee form. It has been reported that individuals homozygous for the ancestral form are associated with a significantly increased risk of ischemic stroke recurrence. MOXD2: The human-specific form lost two terminal exons, which include 3 UTR and poly (A) signal as well as nearly a quarter of the 618 residue protein coding region, including the C-terminal GPI anchor residues. The gene bears a homology with dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH), is highly conserved in animal species, and in mouse is highly expressed in medial olfactory epithelium. S100A15A: The human form lacks the first of the two coding exons in the chimpanzee gene, which includes the start codon. The S100 proteins are calcium-binding proteins. The mouse ortholog s100a15 was detected in differentiating cells of the hair follicles and cornified layer during skin maturation. The gene has also been reported to be expressed in mammary gland and upregulated during mammary tumorigenesis. <b>Hydrophobicity< b> Nothing to report this year',\n",
       " 'Our growth regulation research has been concerned with oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes as positive and negative regulators of normal and neoplastic growth. The work is focused on the regulation of the Ras-superfamily of proteins and their role in cancer, as well as on the role of adhesion in cancer. Here we highlight two ongoing projects. 1) We are studying Sipa-1 Spa-1, which encodes a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates the Rap-GTPases (a Ras-superfamily group) by enzymatically converting active Rap-GTP to inactive Rap-GDP. In collaboration with the Laboratory of Kent Hunter in CCR, we have identified Sipa-1 as a gene that can promote metastasis in a mouse breast cancer model. Consistent with this role in the mouse model, metatstatic human prostate cancer was found to be associated with Sipa-1 overexpression. Rap-GTP has several functions, including the promotion of cell adhesion and cell polarity, both of which may inhibit metastasis in many tumor systems. Our working hypothesis is that overexpression of Sipa-1 promotes metastasis at least in part by decreasing Rap-GTP-dependent adhesion and polarity. A positive role in cancer has not been reported previously for the negative regulator of a Ras-superfamily group, as most negative regulators of the Ras-superfamily groups inhibit cancer (or have no effect), rather than promote it. If a pathogenetic role is validated for Sipa-1 in human cancer, the gene and its encoded protein may represent an attractive candidate molecular target. In addition, a gene called Anakin has been identified as interacting with Sipa-1, to negatively regulate the Rap-GAP activity of Sipa-1, and to alter the anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells in agar and the tumorigenicity in vivo. A polymorphism of the human Anakin gene has been identified, and found to correlate with disease severity in human breast cancer. 2) We are also investigating E-cadherin, a key cell surface adhesion protein that is a tumor suppressor frequently silenced in many epithelial cancers and melanoma, especially those with high metastatic potential. We have found that E-cadherin specifically inhibits the activation of a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by their physiologic ligands. In human inflammatory breast cancer, however, E-cadherin is paradoxically elevated. We have found in a human inflammatory breast cancer cell line that the presence of E-cadherin actually sensitizes the cells to ligand-dependent activation of RTKs, which is just the opposite of what is seen in normal cells. The results imply that in inflammatory breast cancer E-cadherin acts paradoxically as an oncogene.',\n",
       " 'Macromolecular interactions are central to cellular regulation and biological function, and antibody-antigen complexes are often used as a paradigms for molecular recognition. Protein-protein interactions are studied unilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for hen egg white lysozyme, a protein which has long served as a prototpye for investigating the specificity of immune recognition. mAbs HH10, HH26 and HH8 recognize highly coincident epitopes and share over 90% sequence homology, but they differ significantly in their specificity properties. Differences in overall sensitivity of the 3 mAbs to mutations in the antigen epitope reflect differences among them in the relative stabilities of their association and dissociation rates. There are significant correlations between the intramolecular contacts, hydrophobicity, CDR flexibility, kinetics, and specificity of these 3 mAbs. Important structural differences among the 3 mAbs which determine the functional differences involve indirect, long-range effects by noncontact residues. It has been proposed that this type of conformational modulation may play an important role in antibody affinity maturation. A second antibody-antigen model, monoclonal antibodies to the carbohydrate O-antigen of Shigella flexnerii are similar to the anti-HEL mAbs, in that minimal, apparently conservative changes in structure cause significant differences in specificity and affinity properties. This a pattern of emergent properties which is of general significance to molecular recognition and directly applicable to rational design of vaccines and of antibodies with predefined specificity and functional properties.

       " 'Our initial studies on p15Ink4b provided evidence that the gene is a tumor suppressor for myeloid leukemia in mice using p15Ink4b-deficient mice. Use of the mice in a retrovirus-induced leukemogenesis protocol showed that mice heterozygous for Ink4b deficiency had increased susceptibility to myeloid leukemia. Mice were inoculated with retrovirus MOL4070LTR, a unique myeloid disease-inducing virus, which was recently constructed and produced in our laboratory. The retrovirus provided the cooperating events through insertional mutagenesis that allowed the demonstration of the susceptibility to leukemia provided by loss of one Ink4b allele. Mice deficient in both alleles were not more susceptible than those deficient in one allele, raising the possibility that there are opposing forces to the development of myeloid leukemia in Ink4b null mice. To assist in our understanding of why Ink4b- - mice are not more susceptible to leukemia than Ink4b- + mice we have developed a conditional knockout of Ink4b based on the Cre-loxP system. Mice, homozygous for the conditional allele, have been generated and shown to express p15Ink4b at normal levels. These mice have been crossed with Mx1Cre mice which will allow deletion of exon 2 of Ink4b following treatment of mice with pI-pC. In addition, mice with the conditional knockout allele have been crossed with LysMCre mice for specific deletion in the myeloid lineage. Mice are currently being analyzed for susceptibility to retrovirus-induced leukemia. The loss of Ink4b expression in a high proportion of myeloid based diseases and increased AML susceptibility in Ink4b-deficient mice implies an important function for this CDKI in the maintenance of normal myelopoiesis. Despite this, little is known about how loss of Ink4b contributes to myelopoietic diseases or of the potential role of Ink4b in myeloid cell formation.We have recently investigated the role of Ink4b in hematopoiesis using Ink4b knock-out mice (Ink4b- -). Bone marrow (BM) from Ink4b- - mice show no changes in the frequency of hematopoietic stem cells but contained greater numbers of bi-potent granulocyte-macrophage progenitors and this was found to be intrinsic to the p15Ink4b cells. Interestingly, Ink4b- - progenitors did not cycle more frequently than wild-type progenitors and showed no differences in apoptotic potential. However, loss of Ink4b was shown to affect differentiation of the common myeloid progenitors (CMP) resulting in an imbalance between erythroid and myeloid potential. This work demonstrates a novel role for Ink4b during differentiation. In another area of research our laboratory has examined human AML subtypes for hypermethylation of the INK4b locus. Inhibitors of DNA methylation are promising options for the treatment of human AML and MDS. So far, it was not investigated whether or not INK4b is hypermethylated in all cytogenetic subtypes of AML. A comparison of levels of INK4b methylation in AML with the three most common cytogenetic alterations, inv(16), t(8;21) and t(15;17), revealed a strikingly low level of methylation in all leukemias with inv(16) compared to the other types. Surprisingly, the expression level of INK4b in inv(16)+ AML samples was low and comparable to that of the other subtypes. An investigation into an alternative mechanism of INK4b silencing determined that the loss of INK4b expression was caused by inv(16)-encoded CBFa-SMMHC (a subunit of the core binding factor fused in frame to the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain). The silencing was manifested in an inability to activate the normal expression of INK4b RNA. CBFa-SMMHC was shown to displace RUNX1 from a newly determined core binding factor (CBF) site in the promoter of INK4b.',\n",
       " 'The EGF-CFC gene family encodes a group of structurally related proteins that serve as important competence factors during early embryogenesis in Xenopus, zebrafish, mice and humans. This multigene family consists of Xenopus FRL-1, zebrafish one-eyed-pinhead (oep ), mouse cripto (Cr-1) and cryptic and human cripto (CR-1) and criptin. FRL-1, oep and mouse cripto are essential for the formation of mesoderm and endoderm and for correct establishment of the embryonic anterior posterior axis. In addition, oep and cryptic are important for the establishment of left-right asymmetry. In the mouse cryptic is not expressed in adult tissues whereas Cr-1 is expressed at a low level in several different tissues including the mammary gland. In the mammary gland, expression of Cr-1 in the ductal epithelial cells increases during pregnancy and lactation and immunoreactive and biologically active Cr-1 protein can be detected in human milk. Overexpression of a human CR-1 transgene in the mouse mammary gland using an MMTV orWAP promoter results in the appearance of ductal hyperplasias in the mammary gland and papillary amd histologically mixed subtypes of adenocarcinomas in multiparous female mice. Recombinant mouse or human cripto can enhance cell motility and branching morphogenesis in mouse mammary epithelial cells and in some human tumor cells. These effects are accompanied by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition which is associated with a decrease in beta-catenin adherens function and an increase in vimentin expression. Expression of CR-1 is increased several-fold in human colon, gastric, pancreatic, cervical, ovarian and lung carcinomas and in a variety of different types of mouse and human breast carcinomas. More importantly, this increase in cripto-1 expression can first be detected in premalignant lesions in some of these tissues such as in the breast ( hyperplasias and DCIS ), colon ( adenomas ) and stomach ( intestinal metaplasias ). We have recently identied the Activin ALK4 type 1 receptor as a co-receptor for CR-1 which presents Nodal to ALK4 and thereby can stimulate Smad-2 phosphorylation and transcription through an SBE-luciferase reporter construct.In addition, CR-1 can function through a Nodal and ALK4-independent signaling pathway and activate MAPK, PI-3 kinase and Akt by binding to the GPI-linked heparan sulphate-containing proteoglycan, glypican-1 which can then activate c-src. Activation of MAPK, PI-3 kinase, GSK-3beta and Akt in mammary epithelial cells by CR-1 are required for the ability of CR-1 to stimulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition, cell migration and cell invasion which is invovled in metastasis and angiogenesis. The invasive effects of CR-1 can be antagonized by the neural guidance protein Netrin-1 through the UNC5b receptor in mammary epithelial cells. CR-1 is also invovled in maintaing embryonic stem cell pluripotentiality and may perform a similar function in adult stem cells in the mammary gland and colon. CR-1 can be found at significant levels in the plasma of breast and colon cancer paptients and may therefore represent a novel marker to detect the onset or progression of these diseases.',\n",
       " 'The mechanisms of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated tumor regression in vivo remain to be fully understood. If CTL do mediate tumor regression in vivo by direct cytotoxicity, this may occur via two major effector mechanisms involving the secretion of perforin granzymes and or engagement of Fas by FasL expressed by the activated CTL. Although the perforin pathway has been considered the dominant player, it is unclear whether Fas-mediated cytotoxicity is additionally required for optimal tumor rejection in vivo. Accordingly, we examined whether a Fas FasL-dependent CTL effector mechanism was important for optimal tumor regression in vivo. To that end, we developed a syngeneic mouse model of CTL adoptive immunotherapy against experimental lung metastases in both minimal (i.e., day 3 tumor-bearing mice) and extensive (day 10 tumor-bearing mice) disease settings. The model consisted of the CMS4 sarcoma, a solid tumor of BALB c (H-2d) origin, and CMS4-reactive CTL, previously produced in immune competent mice using an anti-CTLA4 mAb-based strategy. CTL adoptive transfer resulted in nearly the complete regression of 3-day established experimental lung metastases. More importantly, under conditions of extensive lung metastases, we showed for the first time that (a) CTL adoptive transfer can promote significant tumor regression, and (b) the mechanism(s) of tumor regression required execution of a FasL-dependent CTL effector pathway. We propose that under such physiologic conditions, multiple immune effector mechanisms, in addition to the perforin granzyme pathway, are necessary to achieve maximal antitumor reactivity. From a positive standpoint, combination strategies that involve the use of pro-inflammatory cytokines, certain chemotherapeutic agents or radiation, for example, to further sensitize neoplastic cells to T cell attack via regulation of Fas expression and function, may have implications for improving vaccine and or passive-based antitumor regimens. In fact, in collaborative studies, we have demonstrated in pre-clinical models that local irradiation of a subcutaneously established tumor combined with Ag-based active or passive immunotherapies enhanced the tumor rejection response significantly more so than either modality given alone. Moreover, the immune mechanism(s) of tumor rejection induced by radiation exposure occurred via Fas-based interactions.',\n",
       " 'Papillomaviruses (PVs) infect the epithelia of animals and man where they generally induce benign proliferation at the site of infection. However, there is a strong association between malignant progression of human genital lesions and certain HPV types, most frequently HPV16. We have generated virus-like particles (VLPs) for HPV16 and other PVs that consist of the L1 major capsid protein or L1 plus L2, the minor capsid protein. To explore the possibility that these reagents could potentially serve as the basis for a subunit vaccine to prevent PV infection, we have conducted prophylactic vaccine trials in animal models. As a follow up to a previous study in which we demonstrated that cottontail rabbit (CR)PV VLPs protected rabbits from cutaneous challenge with infectious CRPV, we have conducted a similar trial in a mucosal model. Systemic inoculation of bovine (B)PV type 4 VLPs protected cattle from oral mucosal challenge with infectious BPV4. We have developed two assays that should be useful for quantitatively evaluating neutralizing antibody titers in human VLP-based vaccine trials. One is an in vitro neutralizing assay for HPV16 that is based on infectious virus consisting of the HPV16 capsid proteins and the BPV1 genome. The second is a VLP hemagglutination inhibition assay which, in the animal PV studies, correlated well with in vitro viral neutralization and in vivo protection from experimental infection. Comparison of the activities of rabbit sera raised against VLPs of seven genital HPV types in the two assays indicated that protection elicited by VLP-based vaccines in humans is likely to be type specific. We have obtained strong evidence that our recently developed VLP-based ELISA measures past as well as current genital HPV infection. Seroprevalence in the ELISA correlated with cervical cancer risk, even in cohorts where current genital HPV DNA status did not. In a series of studies to quantitatively assess the risk associated with HPV16 infection for various human cancers, we and our collaborators have found a strong association between the presence of HPV16 virion antibodies and cervical, vulvar, anal, and (unexpectedly) esophageal cancer but not penile cancer, in cross-sectional case-control studies. In prospective studies, seropositivity was strongly associated with the subsequent development of cervical and esophageal, but not laryngeal or oral. ',\n",
       " 'The studies in the laboratory have focused on two broad areas: signal transduction involving low molecular weight GTPases such as Ras and Rap1, and the role of tumor suppressor genes in cell growth regulation and tumorigenesis. As a focus for these studies, we have been investigating the molecular pathology of two human genetic diseases: neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Both conditions predispose affected individuals to the development of benign tumors in a wide variety of organs, and more rarely to malignant tumors. In the NF1 studes, we have found that normal Schwann cell growth is regulated through an interaction of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway and the neuregulin tyrosine kinase receptor pathway. Specifically, we found that stimulation of Schwann cells with glial growth factor (GGF) increased the level of intracellular cAMP. Furthermore, in contrast to fibroblasts, activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK-A) did not block the Ras Raf-1 MAP kinase pathway in Schwann cells. The product of the tuberous sclerosis-2 gene (TSC2), designated tuberin, interacts with the low molecular weight GTPase Rap1, and may regulate its activity by stimulating the GTPase activity of this protein. We have shown that there is a significant degree of overlap in the intracellular localization of these proteins, and in their staining patterns in tissues that are affected in patients with TSC, such as the kidney and brain. Furthermore, we have found that a significant proportion of non- TSC brain tumors show a reduction or loss of tuberin expression, suggesting that TSC2 may also function as a tumor suppressor in sporadic human tumors. Currently, we are conducting a structure function analysis of TSC2, using a combination of site-directed and naturally occuring mutants to study the effect of these mutant TSC2 products on cell growth, as well as in assays of the biochemical function and intracellular localization of tuberin.

       " \"Mechanism of Hypopigmentary Diseases - We have recently reported the surprising finding that all 4 known major forms of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) are in fact ER-processing trafficking diseases stemming from the abortive processing and or sorting of tyrosinase (the critical melanogenic enzyme). In OCA types 1-4, tyrosinases, either mutant (as in OCA1) or wild-type (as in OCA2, OCA3 and OCA4), are retained in the ER and prematurely degraded by proteasomes and or are incorrectly sorted to melanosomes. This ER quality control system in melanocytes is exquisitely sensitive and detects even very minor perturbations in melanosomal proteins. These findings reveal why mutations in a number of pigment-related genes can have dramatic phenotypic effects on skin, hair and eye pigmentation, even in the presence of normal, catalytically functional tyrosinase. UV-Induced DNA Damage in Human Skin - we have completed the initial phase of a clinical study being performed in collaboration with the FDA to characterize the influence of skin pigment phenotype and phototype on UV-induced DNA damage. We have found that constitutive melanin in the skin does afford significant protection from UV damage, but not total protection, and even the darkest skin incurs some DNA damage. One surprising finding was that DNA damage is repaired more efficiently in darker skin, although whether this results from more efficient repair pathways or reflects the lower amounts of DNA damage that the system has to contend with, is not yet known. Another unexpected finding was that UV-induced apoptosis was significantly higher in dark skin than in light skin. Melanosomal Proteomics and Informatics - We have completed our project to characterize the proteome of melanosomes during their maturation. Determining the dynamics of proteins sorted to various stages of melanosomes has provided glimpses of the biogenic pathway of that organelle (which probably also occurs for other lysosome-related organelles, although not so easy to discern since they don't display obvious structural changes as do melanosomes). The intent of this project was to identify novel specific constituents of melanosomes that might serve as targets for malignant melanoma and or identify other novel specific biomarkers of melanocytes. Regulation of Melanocyte Function - We have further clarified the role of how UV radiation and the MSH receptor (MC1R) regulate human pigmentation, how the expression and function of MC1R is regulated by its agonist (MSH) and its antagonist (ASP), and the signaling pathways involved in its regulation of melanocyte differentiation.\",\n",
       " 'A central question in HIV infection is how viral RNA is specifically recognized and packaged into virions. Encapsidation of HIV-1 is a multistep process which involves recognition, selection, dimerization and packaging. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that this process is governed by specific interactions between the nucleocapsid domain (NCp7) of gag and the encapsidation-dimerization linker sequence (E-DLS). We have shown by extensive computer analysis and RNase mapping that the retroviral E-DLS can be folded into stem and loop structures; disruption of part or all of these RNA structures can impair packaging. The NC proteins of HIV-1 contain two copies of a Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X4-Cys sequence referred to as \"CCHC\" Zinc-finger motif. The three dimensional structure of the two zinc finger motifs of NCp7 from HIV-1 shows that each finger folds independently when in coordination with Zn 2+. The binding site on HIV-1 viral RNA recognized by NCp7 is called the packaging site, Psi. The Psi site is located upstream of the gag translation initiation codon and includes the splice donor site and a highly conserved purine rich region. A chemical interference analysis mapped the nucleotides critical for NCp7 binding to a region of 4 nucleotides located within a single stem-loop structure. Elucidation of the molecular details required for HIV-1 encapsidation has given impetus to new approaches for the design of anti-viral agents. Several disulfide benzamides have been shown to eject HIV-1 NCp7 zinc from purified virions and to possess anti-retroviral activity in cell cultures at low micromolar concentrations (Rice et al. Nature 361: 473, 1993; Rice et al. Science 270: 1194, 1995). New congeners of the disulfide benzamide series are under intense investigation in our laboratory and should provide new compounds with potential therapeutic value and should function to block HIV-1 encapsidation and efficient assembly of infectious virions. These drugs directed at highly conserved targets should be effective against all serotypes and mutants of HIV-1 and should not be susceptible to drug resistance. ',\n",
       " 'Members of the Ly-49 gene family encode type-II integral transmembrane proteins and are primarily expressed on the surface of murine NK cells. Our monoclonal antibody (4D11) reacts with Ly-49G2 represents a type II transmembrane protein of 268 amino acids with its carboxyl end exposed extracellularly. Ly-49G2+ cells failed to lyse several H-2Dd expressing tumor targets and Con A lymphoblasts from BALB c, but not C57BL 6 mice. This inhibition of lysis by Ly-49G2+ NK cells was negated by addition of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4D11 or anti-class I antibodies to Dd or Ld. Our recent studies have generated and characterized a mAb (12A8) that can recognize the Ly-49D subset of murine NK cells. Ly-49D+ subset of NK cells that did not express Ly-49A, C, and G2 failed to demonstrate an inhibitory pattern when tested on targets [tumor and lymphoblast] expressing a variety of H-2 haplotypes. More importantly we demonstrate that the addition of mAb 12A8 to Ly-49D+ NK cells can augment lysis of Fc-gammaR+ target cells in a RADCC-type assay and induces apoptosis in Ly-49D+ NK cells. Examination of the cytoplasmic domain of Ly-49D indicates that it does not contain the V IxYxxL ITIM motif found in Ly-49A, C or G2 that has been characterized in the human p58 KIRs. Therefore, Ly-49D is the first member of the Ly-49 family characterized as transmitting positive signals to NK cells, rather than inhibiting NK cell function. These studies are critical to the study of the structure function of the various Ly-49 receptors. We have cloned and analyzed a 7 kB mRNA in NK cells that has been termed the NK-TR. Antibodies to the NK-TR or its peptides have indicated a role for this molecule in the cytolytic process of NK cells. Direct evidence for the importance of NK-TR in NK killing was obtained by generating antisense NK-TR transfectants of the rat NK-cell line, RNK-16. Introduction of a cDNA vector producing antisense NK-TR mRNA abolished the ability of these cells to kill several tumor targets as well as virus-infected [NK-sensitive] cell lines. Lectin-mediated killing ADCC and reverse-ADCC were unaffected by antisense expression. We are currently determining if there are alterations in kinase activity in the antisense transfectants in order to identify potential lesions in the normal signal transduction pathway. ',\n",
       " 'The granule exocytosis model of lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity postulates an antigen-triggered rapid secretion of preformed cytotoxic mediators into the synapse-like space between the cytotoxic lymphocyte and its bound target. The generally accepted cytotoxic mediators are perforin and the granzyme subfamily of serine proteases. mRNA encoding a novel member of the thiol protease family, cathepsin W, has been shown to be expressed exclusively in NK and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, suggesting a functional role in cytotoxicity, although a recent paper reported that cathepsin W knockout lymphocytes have normal cytotoxic activity. While nothing is known about cathepsin W protease activity, the protein has been reported by another group to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum,. We hypothesize that cathepsin W is a granule cytotoxic mediator with functionally redundant protease activity similar to granzymes. In order to study cathepsin W, we expressed human procathepsin W in E. coli and made a series of monoclonal antibodies against it. Western blots of extracts of NK cells and to a lesser extent CTL show mAb reactivity with a single 25-30kD band, where processed, catalytically active cathepsin W is expected. Other mAb react with a 45kD band, consistent with procathepsin W. When human NK92 cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin to trigger granule exocytosis, cathepsin W was depleted from the cells and released into the medium within 3 hours and similar results were seen when human CD8+ CTL were treated with anti-CD3. In both cases cat W release paralleled degranulation as measured by granzyme A release. Fluorescence microscopy on NK cells with anti-cathepsin W mAbs show that mature cathepsin W is expressed within the cytoplasm in a vesicular granular pattern colocalizing with stains for perforin and granzyme A, while procathepsin W is seen in a more diffuse pattern consistent with endoplasmic reticulum. Currently we are using anti-cathepsin W mAb to purify the mature enzyme from NK92 cells and allow study of its enzymatic properties.We have examined the functional status of granule exocytosis in nave, memory, and effector subpopulations of human blood T lymphocytes phenotypically defined by surface markers. When purified directly from blood and immediately assayed by redirected cytotoxicity, only CD8+ effector T cells showed cytotoxic activity. After anti-CD3 anti-CD28 crosslinking, memory T cells became cytotoxic after 48 hours of culture, while both nave and memory cells were cytotoxic after 72 hours. When fixed and permeabilized blood lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry, the effector subset of CD8+ T cells expressed the granule markers granzyme A and B and perforin most strongly. There was limited granule marker expression in CD8+ effector memory cells, while other CD8+ T cell subsets and all CD4+ subsets were negative for all granule markers tested. Both CD4+ and CD8+ blasts were positive for all granule markers, and both cells showed activation-induced surface expression of the lysosomal membrane marker CD107a.',\n",
       " 'Cellular mediators of innate immunity have the capacity to recognize and respond to pathogens in the absence of antibody or T cells. It is now known that the principal cellular receptors mediating pathogen recognition are the Toll like receptors (TLRs), a family of ten paralogs that respond to a wide variety of pathogen derived substances by initiating inflammatory reactions. In addition, TLRs on immature dendritic cells (iDC) drive maturation in response to pathogens, an essential component of acquired immunity. We have previously shown that the H2 histamine receptor on iDC can profoundly affect the maturation process induced by LPS through TLR4. Histamine is produced by mast cells, which are located in the same microenvironment as DC, and we demonstrated that human monocyte-derived iDC express two active histamine receptors, H1 and H2. Although histamine failed to affect the LPS-driven maturation of iDC with regard to phenotypic changes or capacity to prime naive T cells, it dramatically altered the repertoire of cytokines and chemokines secreted by mature DC. In monocyte-derived DC histamine increased IL-10 and reduced IL-12 secretion, and in plasmacytoid DC histamine caused a decrease in type-I interferon production. As a result of its affects upon cytokine secretion, histamine-treated DC induced a Th2 phenotype during T cell priming. We are currently testing in mice the hypothesis that maturation of DC in a microenvironment that is rich in histamine will promote the generation of Th2 cells in the draining lymph nodes. To do this we have established a system in which T cells from TCR transgenic mice are adoptively transferred into syngeneic normal mice. The TCR is specific for ovalbumin, and we have shown that subcutaneous injection with the antigen together with either LPS or CpG ODNs (which stimulate TLR4 and TLR9 respectively) as adjuvant induce proliferation of nave transgenic T cells in the draining lymph nodes. Interestingly, we have found that stimulators of mast cell degranulation, administered with antigen and adjuvant modify the polarization of T cells in the draining lymph nodes, as seen by abrogation of IFN-g production. These data provide evidence that allergy can affect the generation of acquired immune responses, which could lead to the exacerbation of the disease.The TLR4 response to LPS requires the binding of MD-2 to its extracellular domain. MD-2 contains a leader sequence but lacks a transmembrane domain, and is secreted into the medium as an active protein or when co-expressed with TLR4, forms a TLR4 MD-2 complex in the ER cis Golgi . By using culture supernatants from cells stably transfected with epitope-tagged human MD-2, we showed that sMD-2 exists as a heterogeneous collection of large disulfide linked oligomers formed from stable dimeric subunits, and that concentrations of sMD-2 as low as 50 pM enhanced the responsiveness of TLR4 reporter cells to LPS. Secreted MD-2 binds to LPS and to TLR4 on cell surfaces, and MD-2 rapidly and irreversibly loses its capacity to bind to both LPS and TLR4 at physiological temeperature. LPS, but not lipid A, prevents this loss in activity by forming a stable complex with MD-2, in a CD14-dependent process. Once formed, the stable MD-2 LPS complex activates TLR4 in the absence of CD14 or free LPS indicating that the activating ligand of TLR4 is the MD-2 LPS complex. Finally we showed that the MD-2 LPS complex, but not LPS alone, induces epithelial cells, which express TLR4 but not MD-2, to secrete IL-6 and IL-8. We proposed that the soluble MD-2 LPS complex plays a crucial role in the LPS response by activating epithelial and other TLR4+ MD-2- cells in the inflammatory microenvironment.TLR9 recognizes bacterial DNA and oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated CpG motifs. TLR9 is not located on the cell surface, but rather interacts with bacterial DNA in an interior compartment as expected, since DNA is released from bacteria after phagocytosis. We have shown that both the cytoplasmic and ecto-domains of TLR9 contain localization signals, and have investigated these signals in the TLR9 cytoplasmic domain by mutational analysis. Interestingly, we found that prior to signaling, TLR9 is located, exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum. Following exposure to CpG DNA, TLR9 transits to endocytic vesicles where it encounters the incoming CpG, but it does so without passing through the Golgi. We have identified at least two localization motifs in the cytoplasmic domain, one that directs ER localization, and a second that leads to vesicle trafficking. We are currently investigating how these motifs cooperate to direct TLR9 to the correct intracellular compartments.A major unresolved question concerns the molecular basis of TLR function. To determine how TLRs recognize PAMPs at the molecular level, we have cloned the extracellular domains of all ten TLRs and have expressed protein for several of them. Currently we are studying ligand binding and molecular structure using purified protein.',\n",

       " 'Apoptosis in NK Cells. Activation-induced death in NK cells occurs when NK cells are activated with IL-2 or IL- 12 prior to receptor cross-linking or aggregated Ig induced apoptosis. Many of the other cytokines tested are able to activate NK cytotoxicity [IL-6, IL-7, IFN-alpha & IFN-gamma], or induced gene transcription [IL-6, IL-7, IL-13, IFN-alpha & IFN-gamma]. The exact nature of the activation signal required for receptor-induced killing is unknown; however, both IL-2 and IL-12 induce NK cell proliferation, a demonstrated requirement for TcR-induced apoptosis. Our recent studies examined the involvement of TNF receptor family members or Fas in this rapid cell death. These studies demonstrated a requirement for cell contact, however, unlike cell-mediated lysis, extracellular calcium was not required. Antibodies directed against Fas, TNFR60, TNFR80, LTBR, and LTa failed to inhibit receptor-induced death. Therefore, NK cells appear to demonstrate a rapid apoptotic episode when CD16 is cross linked, but the mechanism of this apoptosis appears distinct from surface moieties used in T cells. The direct examination of the Fas pathway on activated NK cells revealed that a protracted kinetic susceptibility. Therefore, NK cells can demonstrate an apoptotic response to both CD16 and Fas, but with a considerably different kinetic and quantitative response. Chemokine Regulation of NK Cells. 1. NK cell chemotaxis studies revealed that macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) are potent NK cell chemoattractants in vitro. Modest migratory responses also were observed in response to IL-2 and chemokines RANTES, MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, and MIP-1beta. Chemokine receptor expression on human NK cells revealed the presence of both distinct and shared chemokine receptors. These results demonstrate that NK cells express functional chemokine receptors that mediate NK cell chemotaxis and may represent an important means in the recruitment of NK cells to inflammatory sites in vivo. 2. Chemokines have been shown to induce the directional migration. We have demonstrated that chemokines MIP-1alpha, RANTES, MCP-1, and IP-10 are capable of augmenting NK-specific cytolytic responses in both a dose- and donor-dependent fashion. Together, these results suggest that chemokines not only play an important role in the recruitment of NK cells to sites of inflammation, but may be important autocrine and paracrine mediators of NK cell degranulation augmenting local tumor cell destruction.

       " 'Our characterization of molecules enriched at the plasma membrane of peripheral blood T-cells, identified a previously unstudied molecule EPI64C (TBC1D10C). The available data provided two clues regarding potential function of EPI64C. First, it contains a TBC domain, which often serves as a RabGAP. Second, it belongs to a family of 3 related protein of which the best defined, EPI64 (also referred to as EPI64A), regulates microvilli in choriocarcinoma cells and is a GAP for Rab27a. We investigated function of EPI64C and its potential relevance to T-cell recognition, envisioning two possible roles: regulation of cortical cytoskeleton architecture or regulation of receptor recycling. Our subsequent analysis supports the 2nd possibility: a role in receptor recycling as follows. Upon antigen recognition, T-Cell Receptor (TCR CD3) and other signaling molecules become enriched in a specialized contact site between the T-cell and antigen-presenting cell, i.e. the immunological synapse (IS). Enrichment occurs via mechanisms that include polarized secretion from recycling endosomes, but the Rabs and RabGAPs which regulate this are unknown. Rab35 is one of the 16 Rabs identified by our proteomic profiling of peripheral blood T-cells. Our in-cell assays suggested that Rab35 might be a substrate for EPI64C Rab-GAP activity. Follow-up studies confirmed that EPI64C is a Rab35-GAP based both on in vitro Rab35-specific GAP activity and findings in transfection assays. EPI64C and Rab35-dominant negative (DN) constructs each impaired transferrin export from a recycling pathway in Jurkat T-cells and induced large vacuoles marked by transferrin receptor (TfR), TCR and SNAREs implicated in TCR polarized secretion. Rab35 localized to the plasma membrane and to intracellular vesicles where it substantially colocalized with TfR and with TCR. Rab35 was strongly recruited to the IS. Conjugate formation was impaired by transfection with Rab35-DN or EPI64C, and by EPI64C knockdown. TCR enrichment at the IS was impaired by Rab35-DN. Thus, EPI64C and Rab35 regulate a recycling pathway in T-cells and contribute to IS formation, most likely by participating in TCR transport to the IS.',\n",
       " \"Successful development of new approaches for the immunotherapy of cancer requires an understanding of complex, interdependent activities of early innate response elements with subsequent powerful adaptive immune responses. We are taking several novel approaches to maximize the host's ability to mount an effective antitumor response. These approaches include optimizing antigen presenting capability through the use of CD40, a TNF superfamily receptor that serves as a potent trigger for dendritic cells which provide a key interface between innate and adaptive responses. The potency of dendritic cell stimulation by agonist CD40 antibodies is enhanced when used in conjunction with IL-2 and the combination of agonist anti-CD40 plus IL-2 shows enhanced antitumor activity against metastatic kidney cancer in mice. Because CD40 is present on various hematopoietic-derived cells, endothelial cells, and some tumors themselves, we have also performed studies to definitively determine if the antitumor effects of CD40 stimulation and IL-2 were primarily mediated by CD40+ hematopoietic-derived cells. We have developed an approach where only tumor cells express functional CD40; specifically we have used models where CD40+ human tumors that respond only to anti-human CD40 were implanted in SCID mice that express only mouse CD40 and do not respond to the administration of the anti-human CD40. These two models have allowed us to show that tumor cells do respond to ligation with agonist CD40 and this response does contribute to limiting tumor growth. Another approach we have taken focuses on the fact that many successful cytokine-based therapies are totally dependent on the ability of the host to produce IFN-gamma, yet the administration of pure IFN-gamma protein has virtually no antitumor benefit in both mouse tumor models or human cancer patients. We have now developed mice lacking a functional IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR) that have allowed us to show that exposure of tumor growth and increase metastasis. Present studies are focused on how to preferentially stimulate IFN-gamma host responses while minimizing the ability of IFN-gamma to trigger immune-evading activities by the tumor itself. In addition, targeted disruption of other events in the tumor microenvironment may ultimately reveal new approaches for combining immunotherapy with other molecularly targeted strategies. In this regard, we have made expression vectors encoding the soluble forms of the VEGF receptors (VEGFRs), Flk-1 and Flt-1, linked to the constant region of human IgG1, and delivered these plasmids to Balb c mice by highly efficient hydrodynamic injection, this strategy resulted in up to 0.1mg ml of the appropriate gene products in mouse serum and successfully inhibited angiogenesis in VEGF-containing matrigel. Growth in vivo of a Balb c mouse renal cancer was also blocked by the same treatment, particularly with soluble Flt-1. Overall, these types of complementary approaches seek to trigger several pathways through which the host can recognize or impair tumor growth, while also targeting the ability of tumor cells to enhance their own survival or inhibit antitumor host responses.\",\n",
       " 'This project aims to assess the role of caspases in T cell death generally. In order to better study their functional role, we have developed a new fluorogenic caspase substrate termed PhiPhiLux which can detect caspase activation in intact apoptotic cells. This reagent is a peptide derived from the caspase-3 cleavage site of poly-ADP- ribose polymerase containing two rhodamine dyes substituted at the ends of the peptide so that they form a self-quenched cyclic compound which is disrupted by proteolytic cleavage. Extracts from apoptotic but not normal thymocytes cleave this substrate after DEVD, and the fluorescence increase is selectively blocked by caspase- 3 inhibitors. PhiPhiLux can be loaded into intact thymocytes in vitro, and in response to apoptotic stimuli thymocytes undergo a time-dependent about 10x increase in rhodamine fluorescence by flow cytometry. This staining increase is specifically blocked by preincubation with the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK. Two-color staining with FITC- annexin-V shows that PhiPhiLux+ cells are apoptotic as seen by their exposed phosphatidyl serine. Confocal microscopy shows that the PhiPhiLux stain is cytoplasmic and in T hybridomas treated with staurosporine appears kinetically after the loss of mitochondrial psi. In assessing the general importance of caspases in T cell death, we have found that virtually all T cell death which is apoptotic by traditional criteria can be specifically inhibited by peptide-FMK caspase inhibitors. This includes the effect of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents on T cell tumors. However, since tumor cell death assessed in vitro may not be relevant to in vivo tumor eradication, we have tested the ability of caspase inhibitors to block the ability of various agents to decrease the formation of colonies in soft agar. Using both chemotherapeutic agents and anti-Fas, we have been unable to observe a blocking effect in this assay by either peptide-FMK or baculovirus p35 caspase inhibitors, even though they efficiently block traditional cell death readouts in the same experiment. We are currently attempting to ascertain whether these differences are due to the different kinetics of the two types of assay, or whether inhibiting colony formation occurs by a caspase-independent pathway even when triggered by Fas- crosslinking.

       " 'In hematopoiesis, the need to continuously generate large numbers of maturing cells of eight distinct lineages from small numbers of stem cells requires a highly complex series of events. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which can remain quiescent for months, must retain the abilities to differentiate into all lineages, to self-renew and to long-term repopulation marrow (LTRA). Numerous critical interactions controlling hematopoiesis are regulated by soluble or extracellular mediators which can have overlapping, additive and or opposing functions on a given cell type. Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-b1) is one of these critical regulators of hematopoiesis since our in vitro and in vivo work indicates that TGF-b is a regulator of all stages of hematopoiesis. A current priority is to further define the physiological relevance of TGF-b and determine the mechanisms by which it exerts its varied and complex effects. Important questions remain to be answered. Are the pleiotropic effects of TGF-b on hematopoiesis caused by distinct roles for intracellular mediators, Smad2 and Smad3, or crosstalk with other signal transduction pathways What are the relative contributions of autocrine and paracrine TGF-b in HSC regulation Can alteration of intracellular TGF-b signals alter differentiation outcomes We have found that TGF-b1 regulates both HSC quiesence and survival through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Furthermore, neutralization of autocrine TGF-b in HSC causes a more rapid engraftment with fewer cells needed for bone marrow transplantation. In contrast, neutralization of autocrine TGF-b in human HSC in the presence of stem cell factor stimulates the production of erythroid progenitors in the absence of erythropoietin. Defining the mechanism(s) of autocrine TGF-b actions on regulating HSC will present new therapeutic opportunities. Furthermore, we have found that Smad2 3 are intracellular sensors that regulate commitment to myeloid differentiation in response to pharmacologic agents. All trans retinoic acid (ATRA) stimulates granulocytic differentiation by stimulating a phosphatase activity which dephosphorylates Smad2 3; while vitamin D3 stimulates monocytic differentiation through phosphorylation of Smad2 3. In addition, crosstalk between different members of the MAPK signaling pathways and the Smad pathway alters the outcomes of myeloid and erythroid differentiation. In addition, we have shown that Smad2 and Smad3 have different effects on early hematopoietic function. Thus, attenuation of specific signals has profound effects on hematopoietic outcomes. Since alterations in TGF-b, its receptors and downstream effectors (SMADs) have all been implicated in tumorigenesis, these studies could provide insights into malignant processes. TGF-b1 inhibits proliferation by restricting passage through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, in part through rapid transcriptional activation of genes such as cell cycle inhibitors. We recently found the tuberlin sclerosis gene product 2, another tumor suppressor gene that causes growth arrest in G1, directly interacts with Smad2 an transcriptional activation mediated by TGF-b (manuscript in press). Moreover, we have shown that tuberin is a powerful stimulator of TGF-b1-regulated transcription and differentiation events in the myeloid cells. Thus, the losses of functional tuberin and or Smads can result in uncontrolled cell proliferation with a block in differentiation. Thus, subtle yet chronic changes in TGF-b1 regulation can lead to pathophysiological states. This ability of two tumor suppressor gene families to collaborate in cellular functions provides an exciting and important new avdenue of study pertaining to the development of cancers.',\n",
       " 'Although it was previously demonstrated that T cell receptor-mediated interaction is necessary to thymic stromal development, the role of costimulatory signals in thymic development has not been assessed. Studies were therefore undertaken to determine whether costimulation influences cortico-medullary organogenesis and thymic repertoire selection. Mice with genetically altered expression of costimulatory molecules CD80 (B7-1), CD86 (B7-2), and CD40, or of the costimulatory receptors CD28 and CD154 (CD40 ligand) have been analyzed for thymic development and expressed T cell repertoire. Disruption of the CD28-B7 pathway or of the CD40-CD154 pathway had minimal effect on development of normal thymic cortico-medullary architecture. In contrast, disruption of both pathways resulted in a profound failure of thymic development. These findings identify a previously unappreciated role of redundant costimulatory pathways mediating an essential function in thymic development. The effect of these costimulatory pathways on selection of the T cell repertoire was studied in parallel. Two pathways of negative selection have been identified. One pathway is CD40L-dependent and acts at a relatively early stage in intra-thymic development and is mediated by a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. The second is CD40L-independent and occurs later in intra-thymic or post-thymic development. Interestingly, we have observed that when negative selection is abrogated by inactivation of the CD40L pathway, functional self tolerance is maintained by a non-deletional mechanism. This non-deletional tolerance is mediated by a CD28-dependent pathway. Thus, redundant pathways exist to protect against self reactivity in the thymus, and disruption of both C40L (deletional) and CD28 (non-deletional) mechanisms of self tolerance results in a population of highly self-reactive thymic T cells. Together, these findings have elucidated the roles of costimulatory pathways in thymic T cell repertoire selection and maintenance of self tolerance. We have also assessed the role of costimulatory pathways in peripheral mechanisms for tolerance. A model system of mouse pregnancy and tolerance to the male-specific H-Y antigen has been used to characterize both deletional and non-deletional mechanisms for peripheral tolerance. Both CD28 B7 and Fas FasL interactions are necessary for deletional as well as non-deletional components of H-Y tolerance induction during pregnancy. The nature of host fetal interactions in the tolerization process is being further analyzed. The role of costimulation in development of functionally unique populations of lymphocytes has been analyzed. NKT cells are a subset of T cells with demonstrated importance in responses to tumors and infectious agents. We have observed that, in contrast to conventional T cells, intra-thymic development of NKT cells is highly sensitive to costimulaton through the CD28 B7 pathway. Either ablation of CD28 or B7 or altered expression of B7 in knockout or transgenic mice severely impairs NKT development. It thus appears that discrete T cell populations, such as NKT cells and regulatory T cells, differentiate through distinct pathways characterized by differing requirements for costimulation. The expression of both CD28 and B7 is highly regulated during thymic development, such that the most immature thymocytes are protected from exposure to costimulatory signaling. We hypothesized that costimulation of immature thymocytes might disrupt normal differentiation, and addressed this hypothesis by genetically engineering ectopic expression of costimulatory receptor ligand molecules. The transgenic over-expression of CD28 and CD86 had dramatic effects on thymic maturation, leading to differentiation of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes in the absence of TCR expression, suggesting a previously undescribed ability of costimulatory signaling to bypass pre-TCR function in T cell development. This observation has provided an opportunity to further define the requirements for pre-TCR in T cell development. Suppression of TCR beta chain rearrangement (beta suppression or allelic exclusion), regarded as a pre-TCR dependent function, is efficiently mediated by CD28 signaling in the absence of a pre-TCR. Ongoing studies are characterizing the mechanisms mediating these critical parameters of T cell development. The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein plays a central role in sensing and responding to chromatin changes including DNA double strand breaks (dsb) generated by insults such as ionizing radiation. Lymphoid cells are unique in undergoing physiologic dsb in the processes of Ig class switch recombination (CSR) and T or B cell receptor V(D)J recombination, and a role for ATM in these processes has been suggested by clinical observations in ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients with mutations in the Atm gene as well as by studies of mice deficient in ATM. We characterize here a defect in T cell development in ATM-deficient mice that is associated with decreased efficiency in V-J rearrangement of the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR)-alpha locus, with consequent reduction in the number of mature TCR-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ thymic T cells. CD4+CD8+ thymocytes from ATM-deficient mice exhibit a reduction in TCRalpha V-J rearrangement as measured by real-time genomic PCR, while containing an increased frequency of unresolved TCR J&#61537; coding ends (CE), indicating a delay in TCRalpha V-J coding joint formation. The absence of ATM thus results in reduced frequency of successfully completed TCRalpha recombination, leading to decreased TCRalpha beta expression and decreased positive selection of mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, defining a pivotal role for ATM in T cell development.',\n",
       " 'Generation and characterization in this laboratory of of the activation antigen-specific mAb GL1 led to identification of the mouse B7-2 (CD86) costimulatory molecule, which has predominant functional costimulatory role both in vivo and in vitro. Anti-B7-2 mAb inhibited accessory cell-dependent responses of T cells in vitro and in vivo, indicating that B7-2 is a functional costimulatory molecule for T cell-dependent (TD) responses. Expression of B7-2 costimulatory molecules during in vivo T-dependent B cell antibody responses correlated with somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation, and in in vivo treatment with anti B7-2 inhibited TD responses as well as memory formation and somatic mutation. The use of mice rendered deficient in both B7-1 and B7-2 has further characterized the functional requirement for B7 costimulation in antibody responses in vivo. Experiments have assessed the requirement for both B7 and CD40 costimulation in in vivo T cell-dependent (TD) B cell activation, using mixed radiation bone marrow chimeras in which B7-deficient or CD40-deficient and wild type B cells co-exist. These studies have demonstrated that, although both costimulatory pathways are critical for TD responses, distinct mechanisms underlie the requirements for B7 and CD40. The requirement for CD40 is cell autonomous in the sense that CD40 must be expressed on a B cell in order for that B cell to respond to TD activation in vivo. In contrast, B7-deficient B cells are capable of efficient response if a B7-intact environment provides necessary exogenous factors. It has further been shown in mixed chimeric experiments that B7 expression by bone marrow-derived non-lymphoid cells is sufficient in these responses, and that B7 need not be expressed on any B or T cell in the generation of TD B cell responses. Transgenic mice expressing cytoplasmic deletion mutants of B7 are being generated to assess the role of functions including signal transduction through B7. T cell dependent (TD) B cell activation was analyzed in the antibody responses of mice defective in the ataxia telangiectasia (AT)mutated (Atm) gene. These mice were found to have a profound defect in vivo in Ig class switching during TD antibody responses, with most extensive defects observed in IgE and IgA response, paralleling the clinical AT syndrome. In vitro studies have identified a defect intrinsic to B lymphocytes in the ability to Ig switch in response to activation with cytokines plus LPS or anti-CD40. Cellular analysis has identified a defect in the process of Ig class switch recombination in Atm-deficient B cells, consistent with a role of the Atm product in the process of DNA break repair involved in this recombination process. Molecular analysis of in vitro responses indicated that WT and Atm- -B cells produced equivalent amounts of germline IgG1 and IgE transcripts, whereas Atm- - B cells produced markedly reduced productive IgG1 and IgE transcripts. The reduction in isotype switching by Atm- - B cells occurs at the level of genomic DNA recombination as measured by digestion-circularization PCR. Analysis of sequences at CSR sites indicated that there is greater microhomology at the m-g1 switch junctions in ATM B cells than in wild-type B cells, suggesting that ATM function affects the need or preference for sequence homology in the CSR process. These findings suggest a role of ATM in DNA DSB recognition and or repair during CSR.',\n",
       " 'Immunoregulatory cytokine changes result from HIV infection, with decreased type 1 cytokines that enhance cellular immunity (CI) and increased type 2 cytokines that augment humoral immunity (HI). IL-12 and IL-10 enhance CI and HI, respectively, and are produced by monocytes macrophages (M M), important targets of HIV infection. M M from HIV+ patients produced reduced levels of IL-12 and increased levels of IL-10, as did M M infected in vitro with HIV. IL-12 p40 and p35 mRNA expression was reduced in advanced but not in asymptomatic patients. Therapeutic trials of pediatric AIDS patients with HIV protease inhibitors suggested that patients who presented with reduced viral loads and increased CD4 counts exhibited a trend toward normalized IL-12 and IL-10 production. Immunization of AIDS patients with an influenza vaccine did not result in detectable changes in viral load, CD4 count or apoptotic T cell death. Patients with CD4 counts >300 ul exhibited temporary increases in flu-specific T cell responses, whereas patients with lower CD4 counts showed no improved T cell responses to flu. Seronegative, HIV-exposed, T cell-responsive individuals exhibited a dominant type 1 cytokine profile when stimulated with HIV antigens, whereas HIV-infected individuals showed a dominant type 2 cytokine pattern. CD8+ T cell lines resulting from HLA alloantigen mixed lymphocyte stimulation generated a factor that blocked HIV infection of PHA stimulated autologous and allogeneic targets, and also inhibited CMV infection of human fibroblast target cell lines. This alloantigen-stimulated CD8 anti-viral factor does not appear to be RANTES, MIP-1a or MIP-1b. Thus, this allostimulated factor is capable in vitro of blocking both HIV and one of the opportunistic viruses that is problematic in AIDS patients. T cell lines generated from patients with Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) were found to be defective in their ability to load peptide antigens in association with HLA class I at 37oC. A similar defect was not found for peptide loading with HLA class II. This class I-associated defect was \"corrected\" by lower temperature (28oC) or by excess b2-microglobulin, or by introduction of the WASP gene. Three different phenotypic patterns were detected among the patients\\' cell lines: those that exhibited no defect at either temperature; those that were corrected at 28oC; those that were not corrected at 28oC.

       " \"T cell development in the thymus progresses as an ordered series of developmental steps best characterized by variable expression of CD4 and CD8 coreceptors. Most thymocytes are immature and express both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors on their surface and are referred to as 'Double Positive' (DP) cells. DP cells are the precursors of mature T cells which express only one coreceptor molecule and so are referred to as 'Single Positive' (SP) cells. Thus, DP thymocytes are bipotential cells with two alternative cell fates: to differentiate into CD4+ helper T cells or to differentiate into CD8+ cytolytic T cells. Development of a functionally competent immune system requires that thymocytes expressing MHC-II restricted T cell antigen receptors (TCR) differentiate into CD4+ T cells and those expressing MHC-I restricted TCR differentiate into CD8+ T cells. How DP thymocytes determine their appropriate cell fate has not been known. We have developed in vitro and in vivo experimental systems with which to study this problem on both cellular and molecular levels. We have discovered that DP thymocytes respond to intrathymic TCR signals by initially terminating CD8 transcription and differentiating into CD4+8- intermediate cells that express IL-7 receptors. The decision to differentiate into CD4+ vs. CD8+ T cells is made at this intermediate stage of differentiation and, remarkably, is based simply on whether TCR signals persist or cease. If TCR signals persist, intermediate CD4+8- cells continue to differentiate into CD4+ helper T cells; alternatively, if TCR signals cease, intermediate CD4+8- cells undergo a remarkable transformation that we have termed coreceptor reversal and differentiate into CD8+ T cells. Coreceptor reversal is mediated by IL-7 and involves silencing of CD4 transcription and re-initiation of CD8 transcription. The CD4 and CD8 coreceptor molecules play an important role in this process as termination of CD8 transcription in intermediate CD4+8- thymocytes leads to diminished CD8 expression and cessation of CD8-dependent TCR signals, that in turn leads to differentiation into CD8+ T cells. Thus, these results lead to a novel perspective on a major biological problem, namely how how bipotential cells can determine their appropriate cell fate. Our results indicate that bipotential cells respond to differentiation signals by initially differentiating into a preprogrammed primary cell fate. They then evaluate whether the primary cell fate is appropriate by whether the initiating signal persists or ceases. If the initiating signal persists, they continue to terminally differentiate into their primary cell fate; but if the initiating signal ceases, they undergo developmental reversal and terminally differentiate into their secondary cell fate. In the last year we have reported four major advances in our understanding of T cell development and T cell function. First, we found that cytokine signal transduction is actively suppressed in pre-selection DP thymocytes by expression of the cytokine suppressor SOCS-1, and is restored by positive selection signals that terminate SOCS-1 gene expression. Suppression of cytokine signaling is critical to prevent DP thymocytes from receiving cytokine-mediated survival signals and thereby circumventing a requirement for TCR-mediated positive selection signals. In this way, only thymocytes expressing TCR with appropriate ligand specificities survive to differentiate into mature T cells. Second, we documented that lineage choice in the thymus is not determined by TCR signal strength as has been thought. Rather, TCR signal strength determines the efficiency of positive selection but has no effect on lineage choice. Third, we identified the molecular motif on the costimulatory molecule CD28 that is required for induction of autoimmunity. And fourth, we reported the discovery of a new homeostatic regulatory mechanism that is mediated by cytokine signals and that dynamically modulates CD8 coreceptor expression to levels that promote engagement of self-ligands without inducing autoimmunity.\",\n",
       " 'Transcription of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes is regulated by both tissue-specific (basal) and hormone cytokine (activated) mechanisms. Although promoter-proximal regulatory elements have been characterized extensively, the role of the core promoter in mediating regulation has been largely undefined. We have found that the class I core promoter consists of distinct elements that are differentially utilized in basal and activated transcription pathways. These pathways recruit distinct transcription factor complexes to the core promoter elements and target distinct transcription initiation sites. Class I transcription initiates at four major sites within the core promoter and is clustered in two distinct regions: \"upstream\" (-14 and -18) and \"downstream\" (+12 and +1). Basal transcription initiates predominantly from the upstream start site region and is completely dependent upon the general transcription factor TAF1 (TAF(II)250). Activated transcription initiates predominantly from the downstream region and is TAF1 (TAF(II)250)independent. Both in vivo and in vitro, basal and activated transcriptions of an MHC class I gene target distinct core promoter domains, nucleate distinct transcription initiation complexes and initiate at distinct sites within the promoter. We have defined a novel core promoter feature that permits regulated transcription of the MHC class I gene, PD1, at the level of transcript start site (TSS) selection. The multiple, dispersed TSS encode a single protein, due to the absence of any ATG triplets within approximately 450 bp upstream of the authentic initiator ATG. Thus, the PD1 core promoter is embedded within an \"ATG desert\". Remarkably, extending this analysis genome-wide, we find that ATG deserts occur non-randomly and most notably are associated with non-TATAA promoters, independent of the presence of CpG islands (CGIs). We further document a significant correlation between the use of multiple transcription start sites and non-TATAA promoters. We speculate that ATG deserts ensure that promoters with multiple TSS do not direct synthesis of aberrant protein products, thereby permitting them to serve as a platform to integrate complex upstream regulatory signals. We have proposed that transcription initiation at the core promoter is a dynamic process in which the mechanisms of core promoter function differ depending on the cellular environment.',\n",
       " 'Costimulatory B7 molecules (B7-1 or CD80; and B7-2 or CD86) are known to bind to T cell costimulatory receptors CD28 and CTLA4. Engagement of CD28 is know to transduce signals in T cells that play a critical role in T cell activation; however, little is known of the ability of B7 molecules to themselves act as signal transducing molecules. The effect of B7-1 and B7-2 crosslinking was assessed in the B cell lymphoma BAL.17. Initial studies demonstrated that B7 crosslinking induces AP-1 components including c-fos and c-jun, as demonstrated by gel retardation and \"super-shift\" assays. These findings indicate that B7 engagement by counter-receptors such as CD28 or CTLA4 may lead to bidirectional effects, functioning to transduce signals in B7-expressing cells such as B lymphocytes, in addition to signaling CD28 CTLA4 positive T cells. The role of CD28 B7 interactions has been analyzed in host responses to antigenic tumor. EL4 tumor cells grew progressively in syngeneic B6 mice. However, transfection of EL4 with B7-1 or B7-2 costimulatory ligands resulted in tumor rejection and the induction of tumor-specific immunity. Tumor rejection under these conditions was dependent upon the presence of the B7 receptor CD28 as demonstrated using CD28-deficient B6 mice for tumor challenge. These results demonstrated for the first time the requirement for CD28 as a B7 receptor in tumor rejection. The role of B7 cytoplasmic domains in tumor rejection was tested by transfection of EL4 cells with cytoplasmic deletion mutants of B7-1 and B7-2, and it was found that tumor rejection was not influenced by the presence or absence of B7 cytoplasmic domains. These results indicate that CD28 interaction with extracellular B7-1 or B7-2 domains can mediate costimulatory function for syngeneic tumor rejection. ',\n",
       " 'This laboratory has established that the pattern of T helper cell (Th) dysfunction seen in asymptomatic, HIV-seropositive (HIVs+) is also detected in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and in two murine models of SLE. These two induced murine models of SLE were compared for the genetics of resistance and susceptibility. Both the graft-vs-host- and the 16 6 Id SLE-induced models mapped genetic susceptibility to genes on chromosomes 7 and 14. These findings indicate that SLE induced by two completely different protocols and mechanisms results in control of resistance and susceptibility by the same genes. ',\n",
       " \"We are analyzing the regulation of cytokine and chemokine gene expression in lymphoid cells. We have chosen IFN-gamma gene expression as a model system for analysis of the control of gene expression in T cells and NK cells. We are continuing to dissect the regions of the human IFN-g genomic DNA to determine which regions enhance repress gene transcription in response to extracellular signals. In particular, we are utilizing NK cell lines to elucidate the mechanisms, both transcriptional and post-transcriptional, by which interleukins 2,4,12,13,15,18 or activation of LY49 activating receptors (murine models) induce or inhibit IFN-g gene expression and effect NK cell biology. We are investigating the role of STAT, NFkB and T-bet proteins in regulating IFN-g expression and how a highly conserved element in the 3' untranslated region may affect IFN-g mRNA stability. We are also characterizing the biochemical pathways involved in the synergistic induction of IFN-g gene expression in response to IL-2 + IL-12, IL-2 + IL-18 and antibodies to the LY49 activating receptors + cytokines by both microarray and proteomic approaches. In another aspect of CMIS research, we have utilized IFN-g KO mice to identify a novel NK cell population that produces IL-13 and IL-5 in response to IL-2 and IL-18. This cytokine expression profile suggests that this NK population may play a role in influencing humoral immunity. Ongoing studies are focused on characterizing the biochemical molecular signaling pathways utilized by these cells, determining their function in vivo and defining the pathways involved in their maturation and development. In a new aspect of our work, we have been investigating the role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma in regulating NK gene expression. We have observed that the natural ligand for this receptor, 15d-PGJ2 and synthetic ligands such as ciglitazone, alter NK gene expression by both receptor dependent and independant pathways.\",\n",
       " \"Expression of MHC class I is dynamically regulated in response to a variety of stimuli. While agents such as TNF and interferon are well known inducers of class I transcription, many other factors also affect expression. We have shown that thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) specifically reduces class I gene transcription in thyrocytes; this down-regulation is cAMP-mediated. Three DNA elements have been shown to be targets of cAMP action. One of these is a complex element that contains a classical CRE and functions as a constitutive silencer. Regulation through the CRE is achieved by combinatorial interactions of tissue specific and general transcription factors, that bind to sequences overlapping the CRE, both 5' and 3'. The tissue specific factor, TTF1, binds the element in the absence of cAMP, partially countering the silencer activity. Following cAMP, TTF1 activity decreases, resulting in increased silencer activity that is potentiated by the binding of TSEP-1, a Y-box binding protein that reduces class I transcription. The tissue specific factors, TTF1 and Pax 8, also regulate expression of thyroglobulin and the TSHR genes, establishing coordinate regulation of these genes. A second cAMP-response element has been mapped to the previously identified interferon response element, IRE. Thus, the class I IRE acts as an enhancer in response to interferon, but as a silencer in response to cAMP. Surprisingly, induction of class I promoter activity by interferon requires not only the IRE, but also the CRE. Thus, both cAMP and interferon function through common elements to achieve opposite effects. The third cAMP-responsive element has been identified at the basal promoter. In this case, the effect of cAMP is targetted to the initiation complex itself, and not to a single DNA sequence element. These studies have demonstrated that the dynamice regulation of class I gene expression requires a series of complex interactions involving multiple regulatory DNA sequence elements, coordinately interacting with common and tissue specific transcription factors. In addition, this regulatory system provides a mechanism for coordinate regulation of class I genes with tissue specific genes. \",\n",
       " 'Early T cell development in the thymus depends on signals from the IL-7 receptor. To determine the nature of these signals, we examined the effects of IL-7 on very early thymocytes obtained from mouse embryos. We observed that pro-T cells at stages I, II and III underwent rapid apoptotic death in culture and that IL-7 protected them from death, whereas beyond these stages IL-7 did not have trophic activities. Cells deprived of IL-7 underwent death by mechanisms independent of p53 and fas pathways; caspase inhibitors blocked DNA fragmentation but did not maintain cell viability. The trophic activity of IL-7 was attributable in part to sustaining a favorable bcl-2 bax ratio, whereas bcl-x1, bcl-w and bad were not detectable in these cells. Emigration of cells from the thymus was examined using a new method for culturing the mouse embryonic thymus and collecting cells that emigrated from it. Tap1- - thymuses were used to synchronize positive selection. Within 24 hr following positive selection, T cells expressing a mature phenotype emigrated from the thymus. These emigrants unexpectedly expressed CTLA-4, which normally represses T cell function. Although thymic emigrants tested in vitro recognized alloantigens presented on dendritic cells and proliferated, in vivo they did not induc acute graft-versus-host disease, suggesting that CTLA-4 or some other mechanism suppresses self reactivity of emigrants.

       " \"The process by which T cells are activated, and the consequences of activation (e.g. new gene transcription, cytokine production, apoptosis), are being investigated by a variety of approaches: 1) studies on the consequences of losing CD45 (an abundant transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase) on activation of src family kinases (especially Lck and Fyn). We have found that these kinases are hyperactive in the absence of CD45 due to hyperphosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine in their catalytic domains. 2) the possible role of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) in transducing activating signals via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). Using both pharmacologic inhibitors of PI-3 kinase activity and dominant negative forms of the PI-3 kinase p85 subunit, we have demonstrated a critical role for this enzyme in IL-2 production. 3) signaling via Fas results in apoptosis. Based on other models of apoptosis, it has been hypothesized that Fas signaling is dependent upon activation of JNK (N-terminal Jun kinase). We have undertaken extensive analyses of JNK and AP-1 activation and have used dominant negative forms of JNK and AP-1, and have found that JNK is neither necessary nor sufficient for Fas-induced apoptosis. 4) activation-induced apoptosis of T cell hybridomas is mediated by upregulation of the ligand for Fas (FasL). We have cloned the FasL 5' regulatory region and are in the process of determining which transcription factors bind this area and which are involved in the regulation of FasL expression. 5) we have discovered that signaling via Fas results in the rapid downregulation of D3 cyclin, a protein required for cell cycle progression. The mechanism for this (transcriptional vs. post-transcriptional vs. post-translational) is being investigated. 6) we have found that corticosteroids prevent activation-induced apoptosis, and have hypothesized that this phenomenon regulates antigen-specific selection of thymocytes. Using transgenic mice that express antisense glucocorticoid receptor in immature thymocytes, or fetal thymic organ culture with drugs that inhibit corticosterone production, we have shown that locally-produced glucocorticoids do in fact regulate thymocyte development, and that this requires occupancy of the TCR (i.e. is antigen-specific). \",\n",
       " 'Using retroviral insertional mutagenesis, we identified SENP1, a protease regulating the dynamic process of post-translational modification by the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO, as a developmentally essential gene. SUMO modification of various proteins, by a process similar to but distinct from ubiquitination, regulates a number of critical biological processes. SENP1 is one of several higher eukaryotic genes related to yeast Ulp1, which encodes a cysteine protease that can cleave SUMO from modified proteins as well as carry out the maturation of the SUMO precursor. Insertional mutation of SENP1 causes a dramatic increase in the steady state levels of the sumoylated forms of a number of proteins. However, only the level of SUMO-1 conjugation increases; levels of the related modifiers SUMO-2,-3 are unaffected. In addition, mutant cells show a decrease in free SUMO-1 and an accumulation of the unprocessed form of SUMO-1. These results have proven a role for SENP1 in both deconjugation and maturation of SUMO-1, as found for yeast Ulp1. The physiological consequences of loss of SENP1 function during development are first apparent after midgestation in the placenta. These defects appear incompatible with normal placental function and embryonic viability. Current work is focused on the sumoylated proteins that show increased levels in mutants. We have isolated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from mutants and wild types and introduced an epitope tagged form of SUMO-1. Preliminary results show that this form of SUMO-1 can be efficiently conjugated to proteins and that these sumoylated proteins can be specifically immunoprecipitated. The significant increase in steady state levels of sumoylated proteins in the mutant should now permit proteomic approaches to determine their identities and allow an assessment of their potential roles in the mutant phenotype. As a second approach to identify SENP1 desumoylation substrates in the developing embryo, we are generating transgenic mice carrying a conditionally active dominant negative form of the SENP1 gene. Results in tissue culture indicate that the catalytically inactive enzyme can bind substrates and form stable complexes, allowing the sumoylated proteins to be co-immunoprecipitated.',\n",
       " '<P><i><b> Structure and Function of Glycosyltransferases: < i>< b> Structural studies on glycosyltransferases have revealed that: (I) The glycosyltransferases have flexible loop(s) which undergo conformational changes upon donor substrate binding and create the acceptor binding site, and binding site for add-on domains.

After the transfer of the glycosyl unit to the acceptor, the product is ejected, and the loop reverts to its native conformation to release the remaining nucleotide moiety. In the metal-ion dependent enzymes, the metal ion binding site is generally at the amino terminal hinge region of the flexible loop. < p> <p> To diversify the catalytic activity towards less preferred substrates, such as sugar acceptors or proteins or lipids or aglycons, the catalytic domains of glycosyltransferases either interact (1) with an additional protein, or have acquired add-on domains at the C-terminus or acquired add-on domains at the N-terminus. For example, in the lactose synthase enzyme, the b4Gal-T1, after conformational changes in the flexible loops to a closed conformation, interacts with a mammary gland-specific protein, alpha-lactalbumin (LA) at its carboxyl terminal end, changing the acceptor specificity of the enzyme towards less preferred acceptor glucose. LA protein, although not linked to b4Gal-T1, acts as an add-on domain. Several other glycosyltransferases have been shown or suggested to require an activating protein which may interact in a manner similar to the lactose synthase system, but no structural studies are as yet available on these cases. In contrast to two interacting proteins, the catalytic domains of polypeptide a-N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAc-Ts) have a lectin domain that is linked to at the C-terminus of the catalytic domain via a linker region and determines the specificity towards a peptide or a glycopeptide. The loops in the catalytic domain of these enzymes also undergo a conformational change upon binding of the metal ion and the sugar donor, while the lectin domain moves, bringing in the bound glycopeptide acceptor in the catalytic pocket, in order to synthesize O-a-GalNAc moiety on the glycopeptide. Also in this category is the alpha-1,6-Fucosyltransferase (FUT8), where an SH3 domain has been identified that is linked at the C-terminus of the catalytic domain.< p><P><i><b> A few residues in the catalytic pocket determine the donor sugar specificity of glycosyltransferases: Role of a single amino acid in the evolutionary divergence of invertebrate and vertebrate glycoconjugates:< i>< b> Based on the structural information, we have previously shown, that the residue Tyr Phe289 in the catalytic pocket of b4Gal-T1, which is conserved among all vertebrate homologs, when mutated to Leu or Ile broadens the donor substrate specificity of the enzyme to 2substituants of galactose i.e., GalNAc or 2-keto-galactose or 2-azido-galactose. These mutants have been used for linking glycoconjugates via glycan chains (see Project # Z01 BC 010742). In invertebrates in the b4Gal-T homologs there is an Ile residue at the corresponding position of Tyr and they are b4GalNAc-T enzymes. We have shown that mutation of the Ile residue to Tyr in Drosophila b4GalNAc-T1 converts the enzyme to a b4Gal-T1 by reducing its N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity by nearly 1000-fold, while enhancing its galactosyltransferase activity by 80-fold. Mutation of this residue played an important role in the evolutionary divergence of invertebrate and vertebrate glycoconjugates (reported in the 2006 annual report). We have also shown that mutation of Arg228, a residue in the vicinity of Glu317, to lysine (R228K-Gal-T1) results in a 15-fold higher glucosyltransferase (Glc-T) activity, the transfer of glucose from UDP-Glc. This activity is further enhanced by LA to nearly 25% of the galactosyltransferase (Gal-T) activity of the wild type. This has been reported in our previous annual report.< p> <P><i><b>Few mutations in the catalytic domain of bovine alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase (a3Gal-T) brodens the donor specificity:< i>< b> We now show that (a3Gal-T) transfers galactose (Gal), and not N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), from its UDP-derivative to an acceptor LacNAc (Gal-b1-4GlcNAc). The enzyme belongs to a3Gal GalNAc family of glycosyltransferases to which human blood group transferases A and B belong. The blood group A transferase (a3GalNAc-T-A) and the B transferase (a3Gal-T-B), transfer GalNAc and Gal to the fucosylated LacNAc acceptor, Fuc-a1-2Gal-b1-4GlcNAc, respectively. The family shares common features, e. g., (1) they all use UDP-nucleotide as a sugar donor, (2) after the transfer reaction they retain the configuration at the anomeric C-atom of the donor sugar, Gal or GalNAc, and (3) their activity strictly depends on the presence of a divalent metal ion Mn<sup>2+< sup>. The catalytic domain of a3Gal-T exhibits very high sequence similarity with the corresponding region of the blood group A and B transferases. Whereas A and B transferases have identical amino acid sequence except for four amino acid residues, two of these residues, at positions 266 and 268, (Leu and Gly in A enzyme and Met and Ala in B enzyme) determine the sugar-donor specificity of the enzyme. In a3Gal-T at corresponding positions have His and Ala residues, respectively. Mutating these residues to Leu Ser Thr and Gly increases the GalNAc activity of the a3Gal-T to about 5-14% of the Gal-T activity. Additionally a mutation close to DVD motif of glutamine (Gln) to methionine (Met) improved a3Gal-T activity for GalNAc to 59%. Close examination of the structures of these enzymes reveal that the three dimensional crystal structures of a3Gal-T and the blood group A transferases (a3GalNAc-T-A) are quite similar except for the missing residues in a3GalNAc-T-A structure that correspond to residues 179-194 in a3Gal-T, which adopt an alpha-helix region (residues 179-187) and a hinge region (188-194). We hypothesize that the alpha-helix and the hinge regions of the a3Gal-T undergo a helix-loop transition during catalysis that allows the sugar nucleotide to enter the catalytic pocket. Thus, to increase the flexibility of the helix region, in addition of mutating His280-Ala281-Ala282 of a3Gal-T to Ser280-Gly281-Gly282, Q228 to Met228, we mutated Pro191 in the hinge region to Ala191 and S191. These mutations have enabled us to convert a3Gal-T to an a3GalNAc-T that transfers GalNAc to LacNAc with an activity that is comparable to 28-59% activity of the wild type towards Gal. These mutants also transfer modified galactose with a chemical handle e.g., 2-keto-galactose, to LacNAc residues on glycoproteins, making it possible to use these mutants, (1) for the detection of alterations in the glycosylation patterns in many pathological states, such as cancers and rheumatoid arthritis, and (2) in the glycoconjugation and assembly of nano-particles for the targeted drug delivery of bioactive-agents. < p',\n",
       " 'Interaction between different leukocyte subsets and stromal cells in different organ microenvironments is critical for optimizing organ-specific immune responses that could limit metastasis formation and control disease-induced inflammation. IL-12 and IL-18 are potent immunoregulatory cytokines for natural killer (NK), NKT, and T cells, and have very distinctive effects on the NKT NK subsets in different organs. The liver is a major target for the formation of metastases. We used a mouse model of liver metastasis to study the anti-tumor activity of IL-18 and or IL-12 cytokines and the roles of NK and NKT cells to these responses. Treating mice with IL-18 plus IL-12 significantly reduced the number of tumor nodules in the liver to a greater degree than did either of the cytokines alone. As expected, IL-18 plus IL-12 stimulated a synergistic increase in systemic IFN-gamma in tumor bearing mice. The anti-tumor activity of IL-18 plus IL-12 therapy was abolished in IFN-gamma(- -) mice. Using intracellular staining, NK and NKT cells were identified as the major producers of IFN-gamma in the livers of mice treated with IL-18 and or IL-12. Liver NK cells were increased with daily treatment of mice with IL-18 plus IL-12 whereas liver NKT cells were diminished by this treatment. Preferential depletion of NK cells with anti-asGM1 resulted in a partial loss of the anti-tumor activity of IL-18 plus IL-12 therapy and revealed NK cells to be an important component of the mechanism for tumor regression. In contrast, the preferential depletion of NKT cells with betaGalCer decreased the number of liver tumor nodules in mice treated with vehicle control or IL-18 alone. Similarly, all treatment approaches showed increased anti-tumor activity in CD1d(- -) mice, which lack NKT cells. Our data therefore shows that the IL-18 plus IL-12 induced anti-tumor activity in mice is NK and IFN-gamma dependent, and is able to overcome an endogenous immunosuppressive effect of NKT cells. These results thereby suggest that immunotherapeutic approaches that enhance NK cell numbers and function while preferentially depleting NKT cells could be effective in the treatment of cancer in the liver.',\n",
       " 'This project continues to involve the biochemical characterization of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) cloned from natural killer cells. The primary emphasis of this project is the study of a PTK that has significant homology to the carboxyl-terminal Src kinase (Csk); the Csk homologous kinase, Chk (previously known as Lsk). Before the discovery of Chk, Csk was the only PTK known to phosphorylate the conserved carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of Src family kinases and down-regulate their catalytic activity. Unlike Csk, which is ubiquitously expressed, Chk is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells. We have shown Chk expression to be inducible in both T cells and peripheral blood monocytes. In T cells our studies have shown that whereas Csk is known to inhibit the signal transduction of the T cell receptor, Chk expression does not inhibit T cell receptor function. In an effort to elucidate the biochemical basis of the differences between Csk and Chk in the T cell compartment, we have compared the abilities of the Csk and Chk Src homology 2 domains to bind tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from human blastic T cells. These studies have demonstrated that the two kinases bind overlapping but distinct patterns of phosphoproteins. Further studies have identified one of the Chk binding proteins as paxillin. immunoprecipitation and fusion studies confirmed that the Chk-paxillin interaction is likely direct and requires protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Consistent with these findings expression of Chk in Csk - - fibroblasts reduces the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. In addition to T cells, we have been investigating the role of Chk in monocytes macrophages using Chk - - mice. Our studies have demonstrated that macrophages from Chk - - mice respond to interleukin(IL)-1 stimulation with increased production of IL-6 relative to wild-type mice. Consistent with these findings, preliminary data suggest that challenge of Chk - - mice with turpentine, a model of sterile inflammation, results in increased levels of serum IL-6 and enhanced production of the acute phase protein serum amyloid A. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are under way to elucidate the mechanisms behind the functions of Chk in the myeloid cells. Together our studies should continue to shed light on the biochemical and molecular control of the immune response. ',\n",
       " 'Overall, my laboratory focuses on the interactions of cognate chemokine ligands and chemokine mimics with G-protein coupled chemokine receptor and the resultant effects on inflammation, autoimmunity, cancer and algesia. We have shown that a variety of antimicrobial peptides mimic chemokines and also have the capacity to rapidly activate host immune responses. We previously identified both a and a types of defensins as alarmins with chemotactic and activating effects on iDC and in vivo immunoadjuvant effects. The a defensins interact with the CCR6 chemokine receptor, while a defensins interact with an as yet unknown GiPCR. Another antimicrobial peptide known as cathelicidin (LL37) and its murine homologue CRAMP are chemotactic for FPRL-1 receptors expressed on monocytes and precursors of iDC, induce the maturation of iDC and are equally as potent adjuvants in vivo as alum. Furthermore, we have shown that even antimicrobial peptides obtained from frogs interact with FPRL1 positive mammalian cells. Apparently the immune functions of these peptides have been evolutionarily conserved.We have also investigated the immune activating and chemotactic effects of another leukocyte granule derived alarmin known as eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN), which is a member of the RNAse family, and has antiviral activity including anti-HIV activity. EDN based on its interactions with a pertussis toxin susceptible GiPCR is chemotactic for iDC, and mDC. In addition, EDN based on interactions with TLR2 activates iDC to produce multiple proinflammatory cytokines and to mature into mDC. Preliminary data shows that EDN also has potent in vivo immunostimulating effects. We have also shown that High Mobility Group Box I (HMGB1), a DNA binding protein with antiviral activity, is chemotactic for a GiPCR on iDC. Our collaborators, Dr. Kevin Tracey, et al, have shown HMGB1 to be a potent inducer of proinflammatory cytokines, to induce the maturation of iDC to mDC and to be highly produced at inflammatory sites.We have proposed calling these early warning signals \"alarmins\". Alarmins are characterized by having chemotactic activity for leukocytes expressing Gi Protein Coupled Receptors (GiPCR), together with the capacity to induce immature dendritic cells (iDC) to mature into antigen- presenting, T lymphocyte activating mDC with resultant in vivo immunoadjuvant effects. These activities of alarmins, if administered together with an antigen, result in considerable augmentation of both cellular and humoral immune response to the antigen. HMGB1 is therefore also an alarmin. Although these alarmins are structurally distinct, they are rapidly released from granules of leukocytes or secreted in response to proinflammatory stimulants by keratinocytes or epithelial cells lining the GI tract, GU tract and tracheobronchial tree. As such, these and yet to be identified alarmins probably represent the early warning system to alert the host defense to danger signals. Like GM-CSF, a cytokine which is also an alarmin based on its chemotactic effect on dendritic cells and immunoadjuvant effects, these alarmins may prove useful as adjuvants in tumor vaccines.GiPCR not only interact with non-cognate alarmins, but also are responsible for the chemotactic responses of iDC to many autoantigens and some tumor antigens. We previously reported that histidyl tRNA synthetase (HRS) and AsnRS, autoantigens to which some patients with myositis develop auto-antibodies, are chemotactic for cells (including iDC) expressing CCR5 and CCR3 respectively. More recently we have shown that of the antigens that induce experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), IRBP uses CXCR3 and CXCR5, while S-antigen uses only CXCR3 to chemoattract iDC. Many other autoantigens associated with type I diabetes, EAE and scleroderma are also chemotactic for iDC.',\n",
       " 'Genes encoding TNF, LTalpha and LTbeta, (the two components of the membrane-bound lymphotoxin) are closely linked at the telomeric border of the class II region of the MHC, and they show different pattern of regulation of expression. We are dissecting regulatory mechanisms controlling TNF inducible expression in macrophages monocytes. We have identified two components in transcriptional activation of TNF gene by LPS: i.e. initiation and elongation (processivity) and we have determined sequence requirements for activation of the human TNF promoter by LPS. We have continued our genetic studies to address the possibility that predisposition to autoimmune and infectious disease may be linked to variation at the TNF LT locus. Although we detect linkage of TNF genotypes to IDDM and sepsis (which may be secondary, due to linkage disequilibrium in the MHC), we are unable to correlate promoter activity with natural sequence variations in the TNF promoter (such as -308 polymorphism known to be linked to predisposition to cerebral malaria). At present we are determining requirements for TNF activation by malaria toxin. We have cloned and characterized the murine LT gene and determined its pattern of expression in vitro and in situ. We have shown that cooperation between transcriptional factors of three families is essential for inducible transcription of this gene in a T cell line. Finally, as a direct approach to assess the biological function of the cytokines of the TNF LT subfamily, we have initiated an international collaboration aimed at generating strains of mice with targeted deletions of TNF LT genes in conventional as well as in inducible fashion. During last year we have obtained and initially characterized mice with double inactivation of LTalpha LTbeta genes and with deletion of the entire TNF LT locus (triple knock-out. ',\n",
       " 'OOne aspect of this project relates to determining the role of the ubiquitin system in mitochondrial membrane dynamics and how this in turn relates to cellular energetics in cancer. This project was begun in yeast and is now being expanded to mammalian systems. We have determined that in yeast that the E3 SCF-Mdm30 plays a critical role in targeting the mitofusin, Fzo1, for degradation. We also have preliminary evidence for the involvement of other ubiquitin ligases in this process. The importance of understanding the regulation of mitochondrial fusion and fission is of great relevance to intermediary metabolism and potentially to understanding how cancers perform anabolic functions under hypoxic conditions. A major aspect of this project relates to degradation from the endoplasmic reticulum. Together with collaborators we are studying E2s and E3s critical to this process. This work has implications for Parkinsons disease where the ubiquitin ligase Parkin is believed to play a critical role in degrading a misfolded protein from the ER. We now have preliminary evidence that other E3s plays roles in this process as well. gp78, also known as the tumor autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR), was discovered by our laboratory to be a ubiquitin ligase resident to the endoplasmic reticulum. We have recently determined that gp78 plays essential roles in the degradation of multiple substrates functioning together with an E2 known as MmUBC7 (Ube2g2). We have now determined that multiple domains within gp78 function together to mediate its ubiquitin ligase activity. These include its RING finger, a ubiquitin-binding Cue domain and a novel region that specifically recruits Ube2g2 independent of the RING finger, referred to as the G2BR. Moreover, we now know that expressing the G2BR in isolation can block ERAD and induce ER stress. We are exploring the potential for such expression or other means of blocking the interaction between the gp78 and Ube2g2 as a means to target cells that are predisposed to ER stress, such as multiple myeloma cells, to undergo apoptosis. gp78 levels are correlated with the metastatic potential of tumors including melanomas and lung cancers. We have now determined that knocking down gp78 levels results in a decrease in migration of cells in response to AMF as well as to other stimuli and to an inhibition of migration in in vitro wound healing type experiments. In vivo studies in mice using knockdowns of gp78 and reexpression have now determined that gp78 does in fact play an important role in the metastatic potential of multiple different sarcomas and that this potential for metastasis requires intact ubiquitin ligase function of this protein. WE have also determined that gp78 targets the metastasis suppressor, KAI1 (CD82) for degradation in sarcomas. This provides at least a partial explanation for our findings. Further studies are underway to characterized additional substrates for gp78 and to understand the degree to which alleviating ER stress through gp78 might be playing a role in facilitating metastasis.',\n",
       " 'MHC class I genes, which provide immune surveillance against intracellular pathogens, are dynamically regulated by hormonal control. In the thyroid, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) represses class I transcription while triggering the production of thyroglobulin and secretion of thyroid hormone which, in turn, stimulates class I gene transcription. Together, these two hormones generate a dynamic cycle of class I regulation. These findings led us to suggest that this dynamic regulation maintains a constant level of cell surface presentation of self antigens; failure to appropriately regulate MHC class I genes would lead to excessive presentation of self antigens, and contribute to the generation of autoimmune disease. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have shown that in experimental models of autoimmune systemic lupus erythematosus and blepharitis, animals that fail to express class I are resistant to disease. This resistance is not due to the failure to generate CD8+ T cells in the absence of class I, since CD8- - animals are highly susceptible to disease. Rather, the resistance appears to be due the failure to express class I in the periphery. Thus, in adoptive transfer experiments, susceptibility to the SLE-like disease is determined by the class I status of the recipient, not the class I status of the donor spleen cells. Studies are in progress to further define the role of peripheral class I expression in the induction and propagation of autoimmune disease. We also have studied the effect on induction of disease of a pharmacological agent, MMI, that we have shown reduces class I expression both in vitro and in vivo. MMI-treatment of mice with experimental SLE or blepharitis reduces the incidence and severity of disease. We have also found that in NZBxNZW mice, that develop a spontaneous systemic autoimmune disease, levels of class I expression increase significantly with age. MMI-treatment also reduces the severity and incidence of this spontaneous autoimmune disease. ',\n",
       " \"MHC class I molecules are the major receptors for viral peptides and serve as targets for specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. HIV-1 infection of T cell lines decreases cell surface expression of class I and decreases the promoter activity by up to 12-fold. Repression is mediated by the HIV-1 Tat protein, derived from a spliced viral transcript, identifying a novel activity for this two-exon Tat, distinct from the transactivation of the HIV LTR common to both one- and two-exon Tat. The target of Tat-mediated repression maps to the basal promoter. However, Tat does not bind DNA directly, nor does it target either the TATAA or Inr basal promoter elements. Rather, its activity is directed to the transcription iniation complex. Using yeast-two hybrid screening, we have identified a transcription factor that interacts with Tat and may be the target for repression. Studies are in progress to further characterization this interaction, and its role in repression. Mapping of functional domains of Tat protein demonstrates that repression and activation are mediated by distinct and separable domains. Tat repressor activity depends on C-terminal sequences, whereas transactivation depends on N-terminal sequence; both functions require core sequences. The repressor activity requires a domain encompassing the region encoded by the second exon of the Tat gene, beginning at amino acid 73, with a C-terminal limit between amino acids 80 and 83. Tat repressor function also depends on the presence of a lysine at position 41, located within the core of the protein. Tat repressor activity is completely independent of two N-terminal domains essential for transactivation, the acidic segment and the cystein rich region. Conversely, Tat transactivation is independent of the second exon encoded region of Tat. As further support for this novel model of separable Tat functions, we have shown that in murine fibroblasts, Tat represses class I promoter activity, but does not transactivate the HIV LTR. We propose that distinct structural domains mediate Tat's two functionally distinct activities. \",\n",
       " 'Supernatants from human glioblastoma cell lines suppressed in vitro- generated cellular immune responses. These supernatants contained IL-6 but not other cytokines. Short-term (minutes) incubations of these supernatants with monocytes macrophages of healthy individuals resulted in decreased IL-12 and increased IL-10 production. When inoculated into mice, the supernatants induced a decrease in IL-12 and an increase in IL-10 production (within 24 hours). These latter results demonstrated in vivo supernatant-induced cytokine shifts across species. HPV-infected women were studied for T helper cell (Th) responses to HPV E6 and E7 peptides, as well as to other immune stimuli. Patients who were HPV- positive with no sign of disease responded to E6 and E7. Patients with cervical dysplasia exhibited reduced immune function in general, and were unresponsive to E6 and E7. The extent of immune dysfunction was related to the extent of cervical dysplasia. Homosexual men who were HPV-positive were also studied for Th function. E6 and E7 responses were observed in patients with anal dysplasia. Immune functional defects were limited to patients who were positive for HIV. These patients exhibited reduced responses in general and were unresponsive to the E6 and E7 peptides. ',\n",
       " 'Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains that have been proposed to restrict membrane protein mobility in the plasma membrane, thereby resulting in their local concentration. Our findings that MHC-II associates with lipid rafts in antigen processing compartments and that lipid raft association of MHC-II is important for CD4 T cell activation led us to investigate the importance of membrane lipids in MHC-II transport and peptide binding. We have found that pMHC-II associates with members of the tetraspanin family that reside in tetraspan membrane microdomains and our future work will explore the importance of these interactions for MHC-II transport, membrane microdomain localization, and APC function using mice deficient in tetraspanin proteins. Newly synthesized MHC-II binds to a protein termed Invariant chain (Ii) in the endoplasmic reticulum, and it is widely thought that MHC-II trafficking to antigen processing compartments is directed by endo lysosomal sorting signals present in Ii. Nevertheless, we and others have shown that Ii-free pMHC-II is capable of endocytosis from the plasma membrane and that these complexes can access antigen processing compartments. We are investigating the machinery that regulates endocytosis, recycling, and endo lysosomal sorting of both Ii-associated MHC-II and Ii-free pMHC-II in APCs in an attempt to determine the functional consequences of endocytosis of these two distinct types of MHC-II. In APCs, antigen processing compartments often have the phenotypic characteristics of multivesicular bodies (MVB). In studies examining MHC-II trafficking to antigen processing compartments we found that activated (but not resting) B cells secrete significant amounts of their total pool of pMHC-II on MVB-derived vesicles termed exosomes. Surprisingly, it was predominantly Ii-free surface pMHC-II that internalized and trafficked to these MVB, highlighting a previously unrecognized transport pathway followed by pMHC-II. We also found that interaction of antigen-loaded B cells with antigen-specific T cells stimulates exosome release from B cells, and these exosomes in turn can stimulate primed (but not nave) T cells to proliferate. Our results support a model that T cell stimulated exosome release from activated B cells serves to augment T cell responses. The movement of proteins and lipids from one intracellular compartment to another is carried out by a well-orchestrated process of transport vesicle formation, vesicle docking with a target compartment, and finally vesicle-target membrane fusion. The proteins that catalyze membrane fusion are termed SNAREs. During our work investigating MHC-II trafficking we identified novel SNARE proteins that could potentially affect intracellular transport of not only MHC-II but other membrane-associated proteins in immune cells. We have been studying the role of these SNAREs in MHC-II trafficking and in the regulation of protein transport in immune cells with the goal of elucidating the role that distinct SNARE isoforms play in regulating protein traffic in APCs. We have found that SNARE membrane fusion complexes are enriched in lipid raft plasma membrane microdomains that regulate exocytosis in mast cells. We have also been investigating the role of distinct SNARE isoforms in regulating secretory granule exocytosis from mast cells using a variety of SNARE knock-out mice and have found that VAMP-8, but not VAMP-2 or VAMP-3, regulates mast cell secretory granule exocytosis. Surprisingly, VAMP-8-deletion only affects serotonin exocytosis but not histamine or TNF-alpha exocytosis, showing for the first time that secretory granule heterogeneity exists in mast cells.',\n",
       " 'Telomeres are unique terminal chromosomal structures that shorten with cell division in vitro and with increased age in vivo for human somatic cells. Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that is capable of synthesizing telomeric repeats, is expressed in germline and malignant cells and is absent in most normal human somatic cells. When telomerase activity was analyzed in normal human lymphocytes, it was found that telomerase is expressed during development and activation of T and B lymphocytes, identifying a potential role for this enzyme in maintaining the capacity of lymphoid cells for clonal expansion. Expression of the two genes encoding the necessary and sufficient components of telomerase, RNA template (TR) and reverse transcriptase catalytic component (TERT), was analyzed, and both mRNAs were found to be regulated during lymphocyte development and activation. To further study the regulation of telomerase at a transcriptional level, a series of genetically engineered mice have been constructed including: mouse TERT (mTERT) cDNA transgenics, green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in as a reporter for mTERT transcriptional activity (also resulting in mTERT knock-out inactivation), and a human TERT (hTERT) bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic that allows study of human TERT regulation in human versus mouse cellular environments. It has been observed that in vivo expression of human telomerase differs significantly from that of mouse telomerase. To assess the basis for this difference, a BAC clone containing the entire hTERT gene was introduced in mice. In these transgenic mice, hTERT transgene expression was similar to endogenous hTERT in humans, and different from endogenous mTERT (mouse TERT): in tissues showing a significant difference in expression levels between hTERT in humans and mTERT in mice, hTERT transgene expression was repressed, mimicking hTERT expression in humans. Reporter constructs and mutational analysis of the hTERT and mTERT promoters revealed that a non-conserved GC-box within the hTERT promoter was responsible for the human-specific repression. Transfection experiments also demonstrated that the GC-box-mediated human-specific mechanism for TERT repression is impaired in human cancer and may play a role in immortalization and malignant transformation. These results reveal that a difference in cis-regulation of transcription, rather than trans-acting transcription factors, is critical to the difference in TERT tissue-specific expression between species. This insight into species-specific regulation of telomerase and telomeres provides an experimental basis for generating mice humanized for telomerase enzyme and its pattern of expression, a model that may be useful in studying both normal human biology and pathologic processes, including malignant transformation. To translate these findings into models of clinical relevance, we have studied the significance of telomere length maintenance in clinical cancer immunotherapy, in tumor-specific populations of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that are isolated from human tumors, expanded in vitro, and used to treat the donor patients. The hypothesis underlying these studies is that telomere length will predict in vivo persistence of T cells used in therapy as well as their clinical effectiveness. Results indicate that the telomere length of administered TILs is highly correlated with persistence of TILs after administration to patients, and is correlated as well with survival of patients treated for malignant melanoma. TILs fail to express significant telomerase activity either in vitro or after in vivo administration to patients. These findings provide a means for predicting the effectiveness of treatment in individual patients as well as a basis for enhancing therapeutic effect by interventions designed to maintain telomere length. In addition to studies of telomerase function, the functions of the telomere-associated proteins TIN-2, tankyrase-2, and tankyrase-1 are being analyzed through construction of both constitutive and conditional knockouts for each of the corresponding mouse genes. Initial studies demonstrated that constitutive inactivation of TIN-2 results in early embryonic lethality. Conditional knockouts have been generated and will be used to analyze the mechanism of these effects. Tankyrase-2 knockout mice are viable and are currently being phenotyped. In addition, tankyrase-1-deficient mice have been constructed, and are also viable. In contrast, tankyrase-1 tankyrase-2 double knockouts reveal embryonic lethality, indicating redundancy as well as a critical role for these two related poly ADP-ribosylases. Conditional knock-outs are being generated to further assess the functions of these proteins. Overall, these studies will complement analysis of telomerase in providing an understanding of regulation of telomere length and function, and will identify targets for intervention to modulate the replicative capacity of malignant as well as normal cell populations. Our studies of genetically engineerd knockout mice have demonstrated that, in addition to the defect in telomere length maintenance observed in complete homozygous knockouts for either of the telomerase components, there is a deficiency in telomere maintenance in mice that are heterozygous for inactivation of one copy of either telomerase component. This phenomenon, termed haplo-insufficiency, has recently been observed in an increasing number of clinical entities, including dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia, and pulmonary fibrosis, resulting from mutation and inactivation of telomerase components or related genes. In collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Neal Young (NHLBI), we are assessing the impact of parental haplo-insufficiency for telomere maintenance on the telomere length and function of genetically normal or abnormal offspring in these affected families. The results of these studies will provide information about genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of telomere regulation in clinical settings. Although the function of p53 in preventing malignant transformation and tumorigenesis is well established, there is much less understanding of the role of p53 in normal cell function. Our recent studies of p53 function in antigen-specific murine T cells have revealed a striking role for p53 in integrating the outcome of signaling through the antigen-specific T-cell receptor and the receptor for interleukin-2. Studies of p53 expression have also revealed a previously unappreciated complexity in transcriptional regulation of p53, and the impact of this complexity on tumor susceptibility.',\n",
       " 'During the last year, we continued define the molecular events that regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence, survival, self-renewal and, myeloid cell lineage commitment and differentiation. We have focused our efforts on transcription factors since they are essential for stem cell growth and differentiation, and are frequently deregulated during the development of leukemias and lymphomas. We previously found that the helix loop helix (HLH) transcription factor, inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1), is induced during the early stages of myeloid development, and can instruct hematopoietic stem cells toward a myeloid versus erythroid and lymphoid cell fate. Furthermore, we discovered that deregulated expression of Id1 immortalizes hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro, and leads a myeloproliferative disease (MPD) in vivo. In addition, we discovered that Id1 and Id2 genes are over expressed in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and may represent a potential therapeutic target to treat human hematopoietic malignancies. In this regard, we found that reducing the levels of Id gene expression in human leukemic cell lines using Id1 siRNA inhibits cell growth in vitro. Future studies are planned to determine if we can inhibit or promote the differentiation of AML patient samplesin vitro, andin vivo when transplanted into severe combined immuno-deficient (SCID) mice. We have extended these studies to determine if Id1 is required for normal hematopoietic development using Id1- - mice. Id- - mice are viable and show no obvious defects. However, these mice have hematopoietic phenotypes including increased hematopoietic stem progenitor cell cycling and defects in B cell and myeloid cell development. We determined that the hematopoietic phenotype observed in the Id1- - mice was not intrinsic to the Id1- - hematopoietic cells, but were due to defects in the microenvironment or niche. We found that stromal cells that lack Id1- - expression can not support normal hematopoietic development in long term bone marrow cultures in vitro, suggesting that Id1 is required for the differentiation or function of the stromal cells. The Id1- - stromal cells show altered hematopoietic growth factor (HGF) production including GM-CSF, SCF, G-CSF, SDF-1, which could explain, in part, the hematopoietic phenotype in Id1- - mice. In addition, these mice showed a defect in the number of mesenchymal stem cells, which suggest that Id1 could also affect the development of specific stromal cell lineages including osteoblasts and adipocytes. Future experiments are planned to generate Id1 conditional knock out mice to specifically delete Id1 in endothelial cells, osteoblasts and other stromal cell populations. In addition, experiments are planned to determine if loss of Id1 gene expression in the microenvironment could contribute hematopoietic malignancy by promoting the survival and proliferation of tumor cells (tumor cell niche). Id proteins (Id1, Id2 and Id3) have been shown to be negative regulators of lymphoid development by antagonizing E protein function. However, it is not known if all Id proteins are physiologically required for lymphocyte development. By analyzing Id2- - mice we discovered that Id2 is required for B cell development in vivo. In addition, we determined that Id2 positively regulates erythroid development by antagonizing the function of Pu.1. Thus, Id2 regulates lymphoid and erythroid development via the interaction with different transcription factor target proteins. Future studies are planned to evaluate the role of Id2 in regulating the survival, proliferation and self-renewal of HSC. In an effort to identify novel transcriptional regulators of myeloid cell growth and differentiation, we have compared the global gene expression profile of undifferentiated and differentiating hematopoietic progenitor cells. We have identified a novel zinc finger transcription factor of unknown function, POGZ, which is down regulated during the early stages of myeloid development. We have generated a mouse strain with a targeted deletion of POGZ. POGZ- - mice do not survive beyond the first few hours of life, and die at birth of unknown causes, suggesting that POGZ is essential for mouse survival. We have discovered that fetal liver hematopoietic cell development is impaired in POGZ- - mice, which includes a dramatic decrease in cellularity. In addition, fetal thymic development is arrested at a very early stage of development suggesting that POGZ is required for thymic development. Future studies are planned to transplant POGZ fetal liver cells into wild type recipient mice to evaluate the development of the entire hematopoietic system, and to determine if any of the observed defects are intrinsic to hematopoietic cells. Alternatively, POGZ will be deleted in adult hematopoietic cells using the POGZ conditional mice established in our lab, and mx1-cre and vav-cre transgenic mice.',\n",
       " 'NK cell have been demonstrated to play a role in the rejection of bone marrow allografts in mice. We have found that NK cell subsets exist in their ability to reject bone marrow cells. The subsets can be distinguished on the Ly-49 receptor they express. Activated NK cells can also mediate antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. We found that activated NK cells can also suppress graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in mice and still proved significant anti-tumor effects. Neuroendocrine hormones have been demonstrated exert immune effects in vivo and we have found that both growth hormone and prolactin can accelerate immune and hematopoietic recovery after syngeneic bone marrow transplantation in mice. NK cell function was markedly affected by prolactin treatment. CD40 is a molecule present on a variety of cell-types and has been demonstrated to play a critical role in B cell differentiation and function. CD40 has also been found to be present on various carcinomas but not normal tissue. We have found that CD40 stimulation by a recombinant soluble ligand can inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. CD40 stimulation by the ligand can also accelerate immune and hematopoietic recovery after syngeneic bone marrow transplantation in mice. ',\n",
       " 'HTLV-I is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and neurologic diseases termed tropical spastic paraparesis HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (TSP HAM). We have constructed an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-I and have shown that it transforms primary human lymphocytes in vitro. We have also identified a fetal rhesis lung cell line that can be productively and persistently infected by HTLV-I. This cell-virus system provides new opportunities to examine the functions and mechanisms of viral structural, enzymatic, and regulatory proteins in the context of a well defined, infectious virus. Mutant proviruses have been constructed with deletions of the open reading frames designated ORF X1 and ORF X2; these genes were entirely dispensable for expression and replication of the virus and for T-cell transformation in vitro. Mutations of the nucleocapsid and post-protease genes abolished virus propagation in vitro but had no effect on virus protein synthesis, assembly, or virion release from transfected cells. These structural proteins may thus have functions at early steps of the infection process. Mutant viruses with changes in the viral transcriptional transactivator, tax, are under examination to identify pathways involved in T cell transformation. Alterations in the expression and activities of signal transduction proteins in HTLV-I transformed T cell lines are also under study. We are also examining the Rev proteins encoded by HIV-1 and other lentiviruses. Rev is essential for virus gene expression and mediates nuclear export of intron-containing mRNAs that are usually sequestered in the nucleus. We demonstrated that the Rev encoded by equine infectious anemia virus induces exon skipping in virus pre-mRNA. This effect was also seen with a Rev mutant defective for nuclear export, indicating a direct action of Rev on the spliceosome. UV-crosslinking studies revealed that Rev bound to RNA near a purine-rich splicing enhancer element which is also recognized by specific SR-protein accessory splicing factors, suggesting that Rev interferes with functions essential for pre-mRNA splicing reactions. Finally, the SIVmne Nef protein was shown to interact with specific cellular protein kinases and to inhibit cell proliferation. SIV Nef amino acid sequence variation was monitored after experimental infections of animals with a cell culture-adapted virus clone. Specific, recurrent changes occurred in the nef sequence in vivo that were distinct from cell culture-adapted viruses. ',\n",
       " 'Stem cell factor (SCF) is a growth factor critical for normal hematopoiesis. The receptor for SCF is Kit, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Activating mutations in Kit are associated with mastocytosis, leukemia, germ cell tumors and gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors. Because of the importance of Kit in normal hematopoiesis, as well as its role in human disease, the objective of this project is to understand the mechanism of action of both normal and oncogenic forms of this receptor in hematopoietic progenitor cells and mast cells, two important target populations of SCF. One specific aim of this project is to define the biochemical mechanism of action of wild-type Kit. Specifically, we have focused on the role of the JAK STAT pathway and Src family members in SCF-mediated responses. We have previously shown that Lyn is required for progenitor and mast cells to respond normally to SCF. This year we published work demonstrating that Lyn contributes to SCF-mediated responses through modulation of Jnks, PI3 kinase and Stat phosphorylation. Although the JAK STAT pathway is critical in responses mediated by cytokine receptors, little is known about the role of this pathway in RTK-mediated responses. Using hematopoietic cells derived from JAK2-deficient embryos we have demonstrated that JAK2 contributes to SCF-mediated proliferation of primary progenitor cells. These are the first studies to demonstrate that a JAK family member contributes to responses mediated by a RTK. Lastly, SCF in combination with cytokines such as GM-CSF induces synergistic growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells. We have found that multiple mechanisms mediate synergy including interaction of Kit and the GM-CSF receptor, as well as synergistic activation of Erks. In addition our studies suggest that Kit makes both a structural as well as biochemical contribution to synergy with GM-CSF. A second specific aim of this project is to delineate signal transduction pathways mediating cellular transformation by D816V Kit, an oncogenic mutant found in patients with mastocytosis, leukemia and germ cell tumors. Previously we demonstrated the critical role of PI3 kinase in transformation of hematopoietic cells by D816V Kit. One signaling component often activated downstream of PI3K is PKC delta. Recently we found this PKC isozyme is activated after SCF treatment of wild type Kit and constitutively activated in cells expressing the D816V mutant. Interestingly, we demonstrated that this kinase contributes to negative regulation of wild type Kit compared to contributing to growth mediated by the Kit catalytic domain mutant. Thus, PKC delta may be a target in the treatment of disease associated with D816V Kit in humans. Lastly, high throughput screening studies were performed to identify compounds that directly inhibit the growth of the Kit catalytic domain mutant. These data could have important implications in designing treatment strategies of diseases associated with this mutation, such as mastocytosis and leukemia.',\n",
       " 'The regulation of PGHS-2 (aka COX-2) by nitric oxide (NO), a proinflammatory signaling factor, occurs at several levels. Using conditionally immortalized murine colonic epithelial cells contrasting in Apc genotype, we have shown that NOS II and NO donors increased COX-2 expression and NO donors increased the formation of beta-catenin: Tcf LEF:DNA complexes. The mechanism of this effect is linked to the degradation of E-cadherin and release of beta-catenin bound to plasma membranes. Although this NO-initiated, beta-catenin-dependent effect was associated with increased expression of COX-2, evidence of direct activation of the COX-2 promoter was lacking. We now have shown that beta-catenin signaling increases the expression of PEA3, a member of the Ets family of transcriptional factors and that PEA3 activates the COX-2 promoter. In a COX-2 promoter luciferase model transfected with a variety of transcriptional factors, we showed that PEA3 acting synergistically with p300 markedly induced COX-2 promoter activity. Nitric oxide, delivered exogenously from NO donors or produced endogenously from transfected iNOS, augmented COX-2 promoter activity of transfected PEA3 p300. The stimulation by NO was not seen with c-jun, beta-catenin, TCF-4, or with various combinations of transcriptional factors, but was limited to PEA3 p300. These studies suggest that NO acts at several levels to stimulate COX-2 expression. It activates metalloproteinases which releases beta-catenin, increases its signaling and thereby increases the expression of PEA3. Furthermore, NO increases the transcriptional activity of PEA3 in combination with p300. We will pursue the mechanisms of this interaction because p300 not only acts as a co-regulator with transcriptional factors but also provides a mechanism for epigenetic modulation through its histone acetylase activity.',\n",
       " 'During normal development progenitor cells of many tissues undergo progressive restriction of pluripotency, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Most, if not all, of these events involve modifications of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, and abnormal modifications of these adhesion systems are often associated with the formation of tumors. The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, are frequently over-expressed in a wide variety of cancers, including breast, small-cell lung and gastrointestinal cancers, melanomas, and neuroblastomas. Using the Xenopus embryonic system, we have demonstrated that signaling mediated by the intracellular domain of ephrinB affects cell-cell adhesion, and that this activity can be modulated by interaction with an activated FGF receptor. This year, we and our collaborators presented evidence that ephrinB1 signaling alters the gastrulation movements of retinal stem cells and is necessary for these cells to move into the eye field. Moreover, cross-talk with the FGF receptor system can control the ephrinB1-guided morphogenetic movements of retinal progenitors. These results implicate cooperative signaling between FGF and ephrin signaling pathways in the early stages of retinal progenitor specification and movement. Furthermore, it suggests the possibility that Eph ephrin signaling may be linked to oncogenesis through their role in development, including control of adhesion, and motility. Among the more exciting tasks at hand are defining which molecular interactions with the intracellular domains of Eph receptors and ligands have a physiological function, and determining the mechanisms by which Eph receptor and ligand signaling cascades are propagated and regulated. This year, using loss-of-function (via morpholino oligonucleotides) and gain-of-function or rescue experiments in the amphibian system, we provide critical in vivo evidence that ephrinB1 signaling through its intracellular domain controls retinal progenitor cell movement into the eye field by co-opting the PCP pathway.These findings are unique in several ways. First, we demonstrate that ephrinB1 can associate with Xdsh via the Xdsh DEP domain and mediate the movement of retinal progenitor cells into the eye field. Second, we establish that ephrinB1 control of retinal progenitor movement requires signaling through its intracellular domain and is mediated by downstream members of the non-canonical Wnt PCP pathway. Moreover, forward signaling through the cognate Eph receptor and canonical Wnt signaling are not essential for this process. These results importantly bridge two signaling pathways that control cell movement, and two developmental fields, local signaling and stem cell specification. These studies mechanistically link ephrinB1 and the non-canonical Wnt PCP signaling pathways as co-regulators of an important morphogenetic process, and show that this signaling pathway regulates cell fate by controlling changes in cell movement.',\n",
       " 'Plk is the putative mammalian homologue of the Drosophila polo kinase and is implicated in regulating mitotic spindle formation and function. Plk kinase activity peaks during mitosis and Plk protein localizes at portions of the mitotic spindle and has been shown to associate with CHO1 klp, a kinesin-like motor protein. Using a variety of epitope tagged Plk truncation and deletion mutants we have identified a region of Plk that is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization of the protein. We have demonstrated that overexpression of wild type Plk transforms NIH3T3 cells in vitro and that such transformed cells form tumors in nude mice. Plk-induced transformation does not require a functional catalytic site or even full length Plk. Overexpression of a noncatalytic C-terminal region of Plk induces oncogenic focus formation. Fluorescence microscopy indicates that cells transformed by wild type or truncated Plk are highly aneuploid and frequently form abnormal mitotic spindles. Aberrant chromosome segregation caused by abnormal mitotic spindles may induce both aneuploidy and oncogenic transformation. Plk protein was found to be highly expressed in 16 or 57 human tumor cell lines and in several types of primary tumors. Deregulated expression of Plk may be involved in the origin or progression of some human cancers. ',\n",
       " \"Cancer susceptibility is a complex genetic trait caused by an accumulation of defects in combinations of genes. Our laboratory is involved in projects designed to identify, characterize and clone tumor susceptibility resistance genes in mouse B cell (plasmacytoma) cancer model systems. In the mouse plasmacytoma system, we have documented that at least 4 genes are involved in determining the susceptibility patterns seen in BALB cAn mice. Three of these genes, Pctr1-3, reside in the mid and distal portions of mouse Chr4. The Pctr1 region shares linkage homology with human 9p21 and 1p31. The Pctr2 and 3 regions in the mouse also share linkage homology with human Chr 1p, abnormalities of which have been documented in a variety of human cancers, including breast, neuroblastoma, melanoma, Burkitt's lymphoma and multiple myeloma. The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor Cdkn2a (p16, p19) was mapped within the Pctr1 critical region. Two sequence variants were identified between susceptible and resistant mice. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments of Cdkn2a were performed to construct GST-fusion proteins containing the allelic variants associated with the susceptible strain. These proteins did not inhibit phosphorylation of RB in kinase assays and did not bind to CDK4-CyclinD2 complexes. Furthermore, when the DBA 2 p16 variant was transfected into two separate plasmacytoma cell lines, many cells were blocked at G1. In contrast, cells transfected with the BALB c variants continue to cycle. Plasmacytomagenesis is accelerated in knock-out mice. Furthermore, BALB c p16 fails to suppress ras-transformation of NIH3T3 cells. DBA p16, as well as, both BALB and DBA p16 and p19 are capable of suppressing ras transformation. These data strongly implicate the Cdkn2a locus as the Pctr1 tumor susceptibility gene. Genetic variation has also been found in the p16 promoter and differences in promoter activity have been associated with one of the variants. Recent work has documented that the ras related element binding protein, RREB, binds preferentially to the BALB promoter and acts to repress p16 expression. Progress has been made in generating relevant knock-in alleles of p16 for phenotyping and validation. In the Pctr2 region, a series of tumor induction studies coupled with allelotypic analyses of a series of recombinant congenic strains have narrowed the genetic interval harboring the susceptibility resistance gene to 1-2 cM. The Pctr2 locus was found to act in a codominant fashion in studies of F1 hybrids between resistant and susceptible congenic strains of mice. Phenotypic effects of the Pctr2 locus were evident in delaying the onset of tumorigenesis and reducing tumor incidences. Efforts have been concentrated on developing a physical map of the region. Sample sequencing and EST matches have identified at least 11 new genes in the Pctr2 intrerval. These genes were evaluated as candidates for the Pctr2 locus. Only one of the genes (Frap, mTOR) differs in amino acid sequence between BALB c and DBA. Functional assays have demonstrated a defect in kinase activity associated with the susceptible allele. Both p53 and Phas1 are downstream substrates of FRAP kinase activity and for both substrates, BALB c FRAP did not phosphorylate the proteins as well as DBA 2 FRAP. Additional studies have shown that BALB c FRAP does not suppress ras transformation as effectively as DBA 2 FRAP. Subsequent studies with the Frap inhibitor, rapamycin, have demonstrated that plasmacytoma cells are non-responsive to rapamycin.\",\n",
       " 'A number of approaches to cancer treatment have been developed that have variable efficacy depending upon the type and stage of the tumor. Although chemotherapeutic regimens are effective for some types of cancers, immunotherapy is the most effective treatment for renal carcinoma. Thus, to further explore the utility of immunotherapy, we have focussed our research efforts on the identification of the effects and the mechanisms of action of cytokine therapy on T-cell function and on the generation of T-cell-dependent antitumor responses. In this context, we have centered our attention on interleukin-7 (IL-7). Our current research has demonstrated that T cells from IL-7-treated mice produce 3- to 9-fold more IL-4, IFN-gamma, and GM-CSF when subsequently stimulated ex vivo. Moreover, addition of IL-12 during this subsequent ex vivo stimulation can shift the cytokine response toward a type 1 pattern as demonstrated by its ability to further enhance IFN-gamma production by 70% and decrease IL-4 production by 40%. Thus, IL-7 administration \"primes\" T cells in vivo enabling them to respond in an accelerated and enhanced fashion and this response can be manipulated by the addition of other cytokines. These studies establish IL-7 as a potent enhancer of T-cell function in vivo and support the hypothesis that IL-7 may be useful as an adjuvant for T-cell-medicated antitumor vaccine therapy. Therefore, studies are in progress to determine the ability of IL-7 to enhance responses to specific tumor antigen in vivo, and if successful, elucidate the mechanism of action. A potential concern in the use of immunotherapy for cancer treatment is that immune system alterations can occur in tumor-bearing hosts; including reduction in T-cell func-tion. Because of the ability of IL-7 to enhance T-cell function we speculated that IL-7 might be useful in the reversal prevention of these alterations. Using a murine renal tumor, our results demonstrate that lymph nodes from tumor-bearing mice have a 50% reduction in cellularity and T cells from these mice produce reduced amounts of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF and increased amounts of IL-4. Moreover, we found that treatment of Renca-bearing mice with IL-7 prevents reverses the reduction in lymph node cellularity. Thus, IL-7 therapy may be useful in restoring immune function in tumor- ',\n",
       " 'In order to facilitate analysis of the complex immune response to cancer cells, a well-defined tumor model system has been established in our group. In this model the mouse renal cancer Renca, transfected with the viral protein hemagglutinin (Renca-HA) as a surrogate tumor antigen, is used. The transfer of the viral HA gene provides a tumor that is much more immunogenic, due to response by CD 8 cytotoxic T cells of the mouse to the viral protein. In addition transgenic mice have been generated where the T cell receptor (TCR) transgene specifically recognizes a single dominant peptide of the viral HA protein (TCR-HA), thus allowing for this antigen-specific T cell population to be accurately followed and monitored in vivo. These mice have been crossed onto strains which lack some of the cytotoxic effector molecules of T cells such as perforin and FasL important for killing tumor cells in vitro. Adoptive transfer of activated CD 8 T cells from these various novel mouse strains (developed in our group) to wild type mice bearing the Renca-HA tumors shows that T cell production of the effector protein FasL is crucial for rejection of Renca-HA cells in vivo, whereas the cytotoxic pathway using perforin is dispensable. The reason for the dominance of the FasL pathway may be that it is more efficiently triggered under conditions where levels of tumor antigen (HA) are very low resulting in a weak signal to the antitumor T cells. This may more accurately model the normal situation in vivo, where responses to tumor antigens are probably much weaker than response to viral antigens. Therefore our conclusions from this mouse model of renal cancer are that the FasL killing pathway may be more important than was previously thought for tumor destruction in vivo. The role of this cytotoxic FasL pathway for killing human renal cancer cells is under further investigation. This tumor model system has also proven useful for a detailed analysis of how drugs affect a CD8 T cell response, at either the generation of the response or the effector phase of the response could be used together with immunotherapy. This is due to the practical consideration that the development of the specific immune response to a single peptide from HA can be easily followed in vivo using the appropriate reagents in this model system.',\n",
       " 'In the past year significant progress has been made in the investigation of the function and transcriptional control of human and mouse class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) receptors expressed on natural killer (NK) cells. We have identified and characterized probabilistic transcriptional switches in the human killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes, similar to the switches that we described in the murine Ly49 gene family. A series of genetic polymorphisms have been characterized in the human switch elements, and the functional relevance of these polymorphisms has been demonstrated. We are collaborating with Dr. Jeffrey Miller at the University of Minnesota Cancer Center, an expert on human NK cell differentiation and bone marrow transplantation to exploit our novel findings. This discovery has important implications for the control of stem cell differentiation, and may one day allow us to modify cell fate in differentiating systems such as bone marrow cultures. Our work has defined a novel paradigm for the selective activation of genes, and we are the pioneers in this area. My group is also investigating a novel spliced KIR antisense transcript that is controlled by a promoter that appears to be active only in precursor or stem cell populations. This discovery suggests that specific silencing RNA is generated to prevent expression of the KIR genes in precursor cells or non-NK lineages. In addition, we have continued to work on the structure and function of the Ly49 gene family in collaboration with Dr. Andrew Makrigiannis, a former postdoctoral fellow who has established an independent laboratory at McGill University (Montreal, Canada). We have recently succeeded in deleting all of the class I MHC receptor genes from the 129 mouse strain. These mice will be extremely valuable for gaining a complete understanding of the role of these receptors in NK cell development and function. I am also collaborating with Dr. Makrigiannis on the generation of a complete set of peer-reviewed Ly49 molecule pages for the AfCS-Nature signaling gateway, and five of these have been accepted and published online this year.',\n",
       " 'Early lymphoid development in the thymus is dependent on gene rearrangement, apoptosis and clonal expansion of lymphoid precursors. We have recently cloned a novel helicase family member from an early lymphocyte library. Gene products of helicase family members regulate developmental gene expression, as well as genome stability and DNA repair. The helicase is lymphoid specific expressed, with a peak of expression during gene rearrangement of early lymphocytes. The helicase gene is a single copy gene in mouse and human. It is localized on mouse chromosome 19 and human chromosome 10q23-24, which is an area of chromosomal breakpoints in some human leukemias. We characterized the genomic organization of the open reading frame in mice. We are currently attempting to express the helicase protein in a baculovirus system to determine its function in vitro. In order to test its role in lymphoid development in vivo we are generating a \"knockout mouse\". We are currently transfecting a targeting construct in embryonal cells. The Ku protein is essential for gene rearrangement as well as general DNA repair of broken double stranded DNA. We have examined the interaction of the two Ku subunits (Ku80 and KU70) with the yeast-two-hybrid system as well as in an in vitro translation system. We determined the minimal functional interaction domain of Ku80 that consists of only 28 amino acids. The region is highly conserved between different species. It shows no homology to other known protein-interaction domains. We are currently expressing Ku mutants in a baculovirus system in order to determine other functional domains necessary for ATP binding or helicase activity. We also have generated stable transfectants of Ku80 mutants in human cell lines to determine the regions necessary for radiation responses and gene rearrangement. AIDS TITLE: N A ',\n",
       " 'In the course of studying the role of chemoattractant receptors in tumor growth and metastasis, we discovered that highly malignant human glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma specimens were stained positively for the formylpeptide receptor FPR, which is normally expressed in myeloid cells and results in their chemotaxis and activation induced by bacterial peptides. Screening of human glioma cell lines revealed that FPR was expressed only in glioma cell lines with a more highly malignant phenotype. FPR expressed in glioblastoma cell lines mediates tumor cell chemotaxis, proliferation and production of an angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in response to agonist moleculaes released by necrotic tumor cells. Furthermore, stimulation of FPR in glioblastoma cells also activates the receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGFR) by a signal transduction cascade that increases the phosphorylation of a selected tyrosine residue in the intracellular domain of EGFR and is dependent on G-proteins and controlled by Src tyrosine kinase. This transactivation of EGFR by FPR accounts for approximately 40% of the capacity of FPR to mediate tumor cell migration and activation. Depletion of either FPR or EGFR in tumor cells by small interference (si) RNA each reduced the capacity of the tumor cells to form actively growing tumors in nude mice. However, depletion of both receptors completely abolishes the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells. Thus, FPR aberrantly expressed in human glioblastoma by responding to agonist activity produced in the tumor microenvironment cooperates with EGFR to promote rapid tumor progression. These results suggest important molecular targets for the design of anti-glioblastoma therapeutics.',\n",
       " '1. Use of Quantum Dots in detection of pathogens. With current concerns of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and biodefense, it has become important to rapidly identify infectious bacteria. Traditional technologies involving isolation and amplification of the pathogenic bacteria are time-consuming. We report a rapid and simple method that combines in vivo biotinylation of engineered host-specific bacteriophage and conjugation of the phage to streptavidin-coated quantum dots. The method provides specific detection of as few as 10 bacterial cells per milliliter in experimental samples, with an approximately 100-fold amplification of the signal over background in 1 h. We believe that the method can be applied to any bacteria susceptible to specific phages and would be particularly useful for detection of bacterial strains that are slow growing, e.g., Mycobacterium, or are highly infectious, e.g., Bacillus anthracis. The potential for simultaneous detection of different bacterial species in a single sample and applications in the study of phage biology are discussed. In summary, we established a detection system for bacteria and are planning to use similar concepts for pathogenic bacteria and other targets in whole animals. 2. A mutant bacteriophage that survives mammalian innate immune system for bacteriophage therapy.In experiments with germ free mice, free from adaptive antibodies to the bacterial virus lambda phage, titers of the virus in the circulatory system have been reported to decrease by more than 10(9)pfu within 48 h of intraperitoneal intravenous or oral administration. Based on these observations, serial passage techniques have been used to select lambda phage mutants, with 13,000-16,000-fold greater capacity to remain in the mouse circulatory system 24h after intraperitoneal injection. In these prior studies the \"long-circulating\" phage, designated lambdaArgo phage, had at least three mutations including one in the major phage capsid (E) protein, which resulted in the change of glutamic acid to a lysine at residue 158. In the current study, we demonstrate that this single specific substitution in the E protein is sufficient to confer the \"long-circulating\" phenotype. The isogenic pair of phage developed in this study consisting of the long-circulating marker-rescued lambdaArgo phage, and the parental wild type phage can be used for studies of viral recognition mechanisms of the innate immune system and for the development of more effective antibacterial therapeutic phage strains.3. A two-hybrid nanotechnology for proteomics.Our goal is to develop lambda D display as a novel 2-Hybrid system that is inherently broad in application and very low in false positives. A central challenge intrinsic to the rapidly growing field of proteonomics is the establishment of an accurate and comprehensive description of those protein-protein interactions responsible for governing complex communication networks as well as those alterations that are responsible for the development and or maintenance of disease states. In order to identify the components and study their interactions, we have developed a 2-Hybrid system that is based on bacteriophage lambda display tools. Since lambda display has experienced great functional successes in binding site prediction and bio-panning, the development of a lambda-2Hybrid strategy to study protein interactions and inhibition of association is expected to provide a simple way to independently verify interactions between proteins obtained through other means, as well as being an attractive complement for easily identifying new interactions with a flexibility and sensitivity unmatched by other 2Hybrid systems.',\n",
       " 'Dr. Ulrich Brinkmann has recently identified a gene termed CAS which encodes a phosphoprotein that is localized to microtubules and to the mitotic spindle. CAS is the mammalian homologue of CSE1, a yeast gene which controls mitosis. Several lines of evidence suggest CAS has a similar role in mammalian cells: One is that CAS levels correlate with cell growth. Another is that CAS antisense RNA blocks mitosis and Gl-S transition in Hela cells. Because CAS expression is high in proliferating cells, anti-CAS antibodies can be used as a proliferation marker in leukemia lymphoma cells. CAS is located at 20q13, a region that is amplified in some breast, colon and uroepithelial cells. We are investigating the role of CAS in these types of tumors. ',\n",

       " 'In conjunction with our studies on mammary tumorigenesis in feral and inbred mice, our efforts have focused upon understanding the cellular basis of malignant progression in the mammary gland. Taking the point of view that mammary carcinomas arise as clonal populations of transformed tissue-specific stem cells and their differentiating progeny, we have initiated a long-term project aimed at elucidating the cellular, molecular, and genetic events underlying mammary epithelial cell growth, regeneration, and functional development. The reproductive capacity of the mammary epithelial stem cell is reduced coincident with the number of symmetric divisions it must perform. In a study of FVB N mice with the transgene, WAP-TGFb1, we discovered that mammary epithelial stem cells were prematurely aged due to ectopic expression of TGF-b1. To test whether premature aging of mammary epithelial stem cells would have an impact on susceptibility or resistance to mammary cancer, female littermates from FVB N X WAP-TGF-b1 mating were injected with mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) at 8-10 weeks of age. A total of 44 females were inoculated, maintained as breeders and observed for tumor development for up to 18 months. Only one mammary tumor appeared in 17 TGF-b1 females while 15 were collected from 29 wild type sisters. Premalignant mammary epithelial cells in infected glands were identified by transplantation of single cell (1x105) suspensions into nulliparous hosts and testing for hyperplastic outgrowth. Although the number of positive takes was significantly reduced with TGF-b1 cells, both MMTV-infected TGF-b1 and wild type cells produced hyperplastic outgrowths suggesting that premalignant transformation was achieved in each group. The results suggest a positive correlation between the procreative life-span of mammary epithelial stem cells and mammary cancer risk. ',\n",
       " \"Chronic kidney disease, affecting over 26 million Americans, frequently leads to kidney failure requiring either dialysis or kidney transplant. Each year more than 100,000 individuals develop kidney failure and nearly 500,000 receive dialysis or kidney transplants at an annual cost of $30 billion dollars. FSGS is the leading cause of primary nephritic syndrome in adults and the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in children. FSGS represents a syndrome that includes variants that are idiopathic and are associated with reduced nephron numbers, hypertension, and HIV-1 infection. African-Americans are at a four-fold risk of developing idiopathic FSGS, and at an 18-fold increased risk for HIV-associated FSGS. In collaboration with the Kidney Disease Section, NIDDK, patients have been enrolled from 13 extramural sites. The study is comprised of 379 cases of idiopathic or HIV-1-associated FSGS cases and 919 donor controls. Structural proteins expressed in podocytes are postulated to play a critical role in influencing hydraulic flow and protein exit from the plasma space into the urinary space in the kidney. NPHS2 encodes podocin, a protein expressed exclusively on the glomerular podocyte. A point mutation in the NPHS2 gene causes an amino acid change from arginine to glutamine at position 138 (R138Q) in the podocin protein. Homozygotes for this polymorphism develop childhood FSGS, but we have shown for the first time that 138Q carriers are at a 5-6 fold increased risk of developing FSGS. In collaborative study we have investigated the possible role of mutations in the PDSS2 gene in susceptibility to FSGS. The mouse ortholog of PDSS2 has been shown to play a role in kidney disease in a promising mouse model for FSGS. We discovered that individuals in the European American study group with a specific haplotype have a 5-6 fold increased chance of developing FSGS. The Wilms' tumor gene (WT-1) is important for nephrogenesis and gonadol growth and mutations in WT-1 lead to glomerular scarring. Variants in the WT-1 gene and the adjacent WIT-1 gene were shown to be risk factors for FSGS. There is still reason to believe that additional genes and or environmental factors affect susceptibility to FSGS and collapsing glomerulopathy as these variant alleles explain only a fraction of FSGS disease incidence. Accomplishments Using mapping by admixture disequilibrium (MALD), we have located a chromosomal region on Chromosome 22 that is strongly associated with sporadic and HIV-1-related FSGS. We identified MYH9 as a major risk factor for nondiabetic kidney disease in African Americans. In two studies, we showed that a genetic locus, MYH9, explains much of the increased risk in African Americans for sporadic, HIV-associated collapsing FSGS and hypertensive kidney failure suggesting a shared genetic etiology for these forms of kidney disease. However, this association did not extend to diabetic kidney failure, suggesting for the first time that the genetic factors and cellular mechanisms leading to kidney damage differ between hypertensive and diabetic kidney diseases. The strongest haplotype and risk alleles have frequencies of 60% or more in African Americans and less than 4% in European Americans. Our finding substantially explains the excess burden in African Americans for these common nondiabetic kidney diseases. It is anticipated that these findings will lead to more targeted approaches for the treatment of chronic kidney disease to prevent or delay progression to kidney failure. We also expect that this finding will have a major impact on public health--genetic screening will be useful in identifying individuals at greater risk for kidney disease and in counseling genetically vulnerable individuals in modifiable risk reduction behaviors. While not everyone with MYH9 risk alleles will develop chronic kidney disease, the likelihood of disease is increased by 100-500% in these individuals. The MYH9 variants explain at least 70%, and possibly 100%, of the difference in risk of FSGS between African and European Americans.\",\n",
       " \"Our laboratory is dedicated to the study of B cell neoplasias containing chromosomal translocations (Tx) which interrupt the c-MYC PVT 1 region on human chromosome 8 or mouse chromosome 15. This Tx interrupts the transcription of either c-Myc or Pvt 1 and is the principal lesion in many B cell malignancies including Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), AIDs-NHL, mouse plasmacytoma (PCT) and in some cases of Multiple Myeloma (MM). There is a restriction associated with this Tx such that only the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene is found juxtaposed to c-Myc and only the Ig light chain gene is found juxtaposed to Pvt 1. Over the past several years, our laboratory has elucidated the structure of the mouse Pvt 1 locus in order to understand the relationship between these two vastly divergeant Txs which, nevertheless, produce indistinguishable disease phenotypes. In the mouse, we have identified a consistent Pvt 1 Ig Ck fusion product which is uniformly found in all tumors harboring Pvt 1 associated chromosomal Txs. Transgenic mice containing Pvt1 Ck and knockout mice defective in the expression of Pvt 1 have been constructed to determine what role Pvt 1 serves in tumor progression as well as in normal development of the mouse. To identify the human analog of Pvt 1, we have looked for DNA rearrangements in samples from patients with MM and BL using DNA probes that span the entire region between human c-MYC and PVT. We have also recently detected a length variation polymorphism in this region of PVT of which one allele is more frequently found in BL patients (suggesting the presence of a susceptibility allele of c-MYC PVT). Coupled to this study is a similar search for the human PVT gene and the eventual isolation of cDNA clones corresponding to PVT transcripts. Our laboratory has also been instrumental in the detection of somatic point mutations which frequently occur in the coding region of c-MYC in these same B cell tumors. These mutations are clustered in the transactivation domain of exon 2 and co-localize with a region identified as the binding site for both the tumor suppressors, P107 and BIN 1. In a search for c-MYC PVT 1 cooperating genes, we have also examined p107, the mouse cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(Waf1) and p53 for co-involvement in B cell tumorigenicity. \",\n",
       " \"Continuing his studies on balanced chromosomal translocations deregulating the proto-oncogene c-myc in BALB c plasmacytomas, Dr. Juergen R. Mueller performed a series of experiments on the migration of translocation-positive B cells in lymphoid tissues of mice in which he was able to document the trafficking of aberrant B cells between the Peyer's patches and into the lamina propria of the intestine. He could further show that treatment of plasmacytoma susceptible BALB cAnPt mice with the isoprenoid plasmacytomagenic C19-isoalkane pristane (2,6,10,14- tetramethylpentadecane) induced proliferation and swift migration of B cells harboring translocations into the mesenteric lymph node, the spleen and the pristane-induced inflammatory granuloma (Blood 89, 291- 296, 1997). This result strongly suggested that normal mice may generate a large number of abnormal B cells with constitutive expression of c- myc. The same conclusion could apparently be reached by a newly developed in situ technique which allowed the detection of up to five distinct translocation-positive B-cell clones in a single Peyer's patch of a BALB c mouse (Genes, Chromosomes & Cancer 20, 1 8, 1997). Dr. Alexander L. Kovalchuk extended his analysis of the fine structure of illegitimate genetic recombinations between Igh mu and c-myc in primary BALB c plasmacytomas and was able to demonstrate unequivocally that recombinations between Igh mu and c-myc are the molecular precursors for a subgroup of plasmacytoma-typical recombinations between Igh alpha and c-myc (Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 122, 111-111, 1997). In addition, he developed new long template and high fidelity PCR methods and employed them to scrutinize various lymphoid tissues of IL-6 transgenic BALB c mice in which he detected a surprisingly high frequency of unusual B cells containing illegitimate recombinations between Igh mu and c-myc. Pursuing the productive ongoing collaboration with Dr. Thomas Ried's laboratory, Mr. Allen E. Coleman employed spectral karyotyping (SKY) - a recently developed chromosome painting method for obtaining a multicolor spectral karyotype of the entire mouse chromosome complement (Nature Genetics 14, 312-315, 1996) - to uncover previously hidden chromosomal aberrations in a sample of ten established BALB c plasmacytomas. He observed several hotspots of chromosomal aberrations involving Chrs 1, 2, 4, 12, 14 and X in that tumor sample and concluded that secondary chromosomal rearrangements may be important determinants of plasmacytoma progression in BALB c mice. To evaluate the true significance of these cytogenetic aberrations for the development of plasmacytomas in BALB c mice, primary tumors are currently being investigated by SKY. Another major project in our laboratory is directed at testing the long held, yet unproven, assumption that B-cell mutagenesis is a requisite companion of malignant B-cell transformation. To address this problem, Dr. Klaus Felix chose to employ two independent, recently developed, transgenic in vivo mutagenesis assays that are based on a phage lambda- derived lacI and a plasmid-derived lacZ reporter gene, respectively. For studying mutation frequencies on genetic backgrounds that are conducive for plasmacytoma research, it is necessary to backcross genes lacI and lacZ onto plasmacytoma susceptible BALB cAnPt and plasmacytoma resistant DBA 2N mice. Dr. Felix, in conjunction with Mr. Kevin Kelliher, has almost accomplished that goal. The great potential of transgenic mutagenesis assays for determining mutant frequencies in B cells has already become apparent in pilot studies on the mutagenicity of pristane (Cancer Letters 113, 71-76, 1997) and small organosilicone compounds, as well as the mutagenic potency of activated phagocytes undergoing an oxidative burst. \",\n",
       " 'The AP-1 transcription factor is a heterodimer of Jun and Fos family proteins that binds to a specific sequence on the transcriptional promoter of certain genes and drives their transcription. AP-1 activity is elevated during tumor progression in several human cancer sites. Keratinocyte-specific expression of Dominant Negative Jun in transgenic mice inhibits induced AP-1 and tumorigenesis without inhibiting cell proliferation or cell survival in multiple mouse models relevant to human carcinogenesis (Young et al., PNAS, 1999). Among these are mice whose skin tumor promotion response is elevated by expression of Human Papilloma Virus E7 (Young et al Molec Carc 2002) and mice induced to form squamous carcinomas by repeated exposure to UVB (Cooper et al Molec Cancer Res 2003). Tetracycline regulated expression of TAM 67 has been directed to mammary epithelia in collaboration with Powel Brown (Shen et al Dev Biol 2006) and has recently been tested for efficacy in preventing HER2 Neu induced mammary carcinogenesis. The results show substantial inhibition by the AP-1 blocker of preneoplastic as well as early and later stage tumor development (Shen et al Ca Prev Res 2008). Importantly, TAM67 expression was silenced in mammary tumors that developed. The transcription factor NFkappa B is coordinately regulated with AP-1, suggesting the possible importance of both factors in transformation (Li et, Cancer Res 1997). Recent observations have identified NFkB non-responsiveness as an explanation for transformation non-responsiveness in the JB6 model (Hsu et al, Cancer Res 2001, Hu et al Carcinogenesis 2004). Transformation resistant cells owe their nonresponsiveness to an inability to activate NFkappa B p65 protein. p65 phosphorylation at S536 is important for DNA binding and for ubiquitination and degradation of inhibitor IkappaB alpha (Hu et al Molec Carcinog 2005). The observation that targeting AP-1 and NFkB elevation prevents tumor promotion and progression has been extended from the mouse JB6 model to mouse and human keratinocyte progression models, and to transgenic mouse models. Transgenic mice expressing AP-1 NFkB inhibitor TAM 67 present a valuable opportunity to identify AP-1 or NFkB target genes whose expression is critical to neoplastic transformation. Expression microarray analysis has revealed TAM67 target genes that are being queried for functional significance in driving carcinogenesis. Such target genes may be promising new molecular targets for cancer prevention (Young et al Trends in Molec Medicine 2003). Recent studies have established the importance of chromatin architectural protein HMGA1 (Dhar et al Oncogene 2004), COX-2, osteopontin, urokinase plasminogen activator, Cxcl1 and MMP-10 (Matthews et al Cancer Res 2007) as functionally significant TAM67 targets. A drug discovery project in collaboration with the Molecular Targets Development Program has identified compounds that mimic the specificity of TAM67, i.e. that inhibit AP-1 and or NFkB and prevent carcinogenesis without inhibiting cell proliferation or cell survival. The primary AP-1 high throughput screen of 300,000 synthetic and natural products coupled to a cell proliferation (XTT) assay yielded a small set of \"hits\" (Ruocco et al J Biomolec Screening 2007). The secondary assay has assessed inhibition of NFkB and identified an AP-1 inhibitor that is even more active against NFkappa B (Kang et al Mol Ca Ther, submitted). New intervention studies in genetically obese mice employ a bean-based diet being tested for attenuation of colon carcinogenesis following exposure to azoxymethane. The bean-based diet was chosen to mimic conditions in the recently completed polyp prevention trial in which human subjects consuming the highest quartile of beans (navy, lima, kidney, black etc) showed a 3-fold reduction in ocurrence of advanced adenoma (E. Lanza and coworkers). The whole beans and two bean fractions showed efficacy in attenuating tumor multiplicity (Bobe et al, Nutr Ca 2008). Recent studies have identified inflammation-associated cytokines as indicators of bean-diet efficacy (Mentor-Marcel et al Ca Prev Res in press 2008). Current studies are aimed at identifying funtionally significant molecular targets of the bean diets under conditions of efficacy as well as predictive biomarkers.',\n",
       " \"Differential display of mRNA analysis identified Pdcd4 (Cmarik et al., PNAS 1999) as a novel suppressor of transformation. Antisense expression of the novel pdcd4 gene converts transformation resistant (P-) to sensitive (P+) cells and pdcd4 sense expression (Yang et al Oncogene 2001) converts P+ to P- cells, thus establishing a causal relationship to prevention of tumor promoter induced transformation. Furthermore pdcd4 expression suppresses tumor phenotype in transformed mouse JB6 cells (Yang et al Oncogene 2003). A surprising discovery is that Pdcd4 expression in human cancer cell lines is predictive for sensitivity to tamoxifen and geldanamycin. Moreover, expression of Pdcd4 actually confers sensitivity to these drugs (Jansen et al Molec Cancer Ther 2004). Examination of the possible inhibitory effect of Pdcd4 on molecular events known to be required for tumor promotion revealed that Pdcd4 over-expression inhibited the activation of transcription factor AP-1 but not of NFkappa B or of ornithine decarboxylase(Yang et al Oncogene 2001). The AP-1 inhibiting activity of Pdcd4 appears to be attributable to blocking the transactivation of cJun and cFos (Yang et al Oncogene 2003). Although expression of Pdcd4 protein blocks AP-1 activation, Pdcd4 does not interact directly with Jun or Fos proteins. Analysis of Pdcd4 binding partners by a yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation identified the translation initiation factors RNA helicase eIF4A and scaffold eIF4G as major binding partners (Yang et al Molec Cell Biol 2003, MCB 2004). Binding of Pdcd4 to eIF4A is required for Pdcd4 to inhibit eIF4A's RNA helicase, to inhibit translation, and to inhibit the activation of AP-1 dependent transcription required for neoplastic transformation. Mutational analysis defines two helical MA-3 domains as required for binding to eIF4A and for inhibiting translation (Yang et al Molec Cell Biol 2004). Residues on eIF4A required for binding Pdcd4 have also been characterized (Zakowicz RNA 2005). In collaboration with the laboratory of Alexander Wlodawer, the crystal structure of the C-terminal MA3 domain has been solved (LaRonde-LeBlanc, Santhanam et al MCB 2007). Analysis of the crystal structure predicts a mechanism by which Pdcd4 acts by competing with eIF4A binding partner eIF4G to inhibit translation initiation, a prediction that has been experimentally confirmed. Pdcd4 expression is downregulated in a number of human cancers, is diagnostic for human colon cancer staging and prognostic for survival (Muduluru et al Cancer 2007). A gene therapy approach to intervention in mouse lung carcinogenesis has revealed that administration of Pdcd4 induces apoptosis and inhibits AP-1 in mouse lung (Hwang et al Gene Ther 2007 and Jin et al Mol Ca Ther 2006). Pdcd4 overexpression inhibits invasion by human cancer cells. The mechanism involves targeting expression of a kinase upstream of cJun N-terminal kinase to consequently inhibit AP-1 dependent transcription (Yang et al MCB 2006). Recent investigation of the mechanism by which tumor suppressor Pdcd4 is down regulated during carcinogenesis revealed tumor promoter induced destabilization of the protein by a mechanism involving signaling through Akt, S6kinase and MEK ERK (Schmid, Jansen et al, Cancer Res 2008). In collaboration with Michele Pagano at NYU, Pdcd4 has emerged as a target for degradation by the ubiquitin ligase betaTRCP (Dorrello et al Science 2007). Moreover, in collaboration with Heike Allgayer (Mannheim) and Yong Li (Louisville) we found that Pdcd4 is a functionally significant target of microRNA miR-21 (Asangani et al Oncogene 2008, Lu et al Oncogene 2008. Current research is focused on identifying specific transformation relevant mRNAs whose translation is inhibited by Pdcd4 expression and may mediate its tumor suppressor activity. Tools for drug discovery targeting translation initiation are currently being generated in collaboration with Bruce Shapiro, Stuart LeGrice, Nahum Sonenberg (McGill Univ) and Jim McMahon.\",\n",
       " 'We created fusion chimeras between GR and the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) that manifest ligand dependent cytoplasmic nuclear translocation for the chimeric receptor in response to retinoic acid. These chimeras serve as potential reagents for high throughput screening for new ligands. The approach has been extended with the development of a GR ER chimera that manifests translocation in response to estrogens. We believe that this approach can be generalized to many members of the nuclear receptor super-family, opening a new avenue for ligand discovery.We developed cell lines in which the expression of fluorescently tagged receptors is repressed by chromatin silencing. Addition of HDAC inhibitors or inhibitors of methylation to these cells activates expression of the chimeras, with the resultant development of highly fluorescent cells. This finding provides a potential screen for inhibitors of gene silencing. Preliminary chemical libraries screens have identified agents that overcome gene silencing and thus serve as new candidates for drug development.',\n",
       " 'The ubiquitin-proteasome (Ub-Pr) mediated degradation pathway has been shown to regulate many important cellular processes. The pathway consists of two sequential steps: the target protein is first conjugated with multiple ubiquitin molecules, then transferred to the 26S proteasome, unfolded, and degraded. Although much is known about how the substrate is conjugated with multi-ubiquitin chains, it is unclear how such substrate is targeted and delivered to the proteasome. We previously identified Valosin-containing protein (VCP), a highly conserved ATPase, physically associated with both the ubiquitinated substrates and the purified 26S proteasome. Based on our further work showing VCP as a ubiquitin chain-binding factor, we propose a model whereby VCP acts as a molecular chaperone that disassembles protein complex, and targets the ubiquitinated substrate to the proteasome for degradation. Since Ub-Pr pathway regulates a variety of cell functions, this link immediately suggests that, through the pathway, VCP plays a critical role in regulating these important activities. These activities include cell growth, apoptosis, immune and stress responses, and ER-associated degradation, etc., all bearing high impact on health and disease issues. Recently, we further carried out structure-functional analysis in VCP, and identified D1 as the major oligomerization domain, and D2 as the major contributor to the enzyme activity. Moreover, we identified a novel heat-inducible ATPase activity in VCP, which is mediated by the D1 domain. These studies further provide a molecular mechanism underlying the involvement of VCP in heat shock and stress responses.',\n",
       " '1. Elucidation of the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis and transport pathway of Pgp and role of conserved motifs in the ATP-binding cassette: We are continuing our studies on the catalytic cycle and transport pathway of Pgp. Based on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties, we have identified the ES and EP stable reaction intermediates of the Pgp-mediated ATPase reaction. Recently, we observed that the ES conformation of Pgp (previously demonstrated in the E556Q E1201Q mutant) can be obtained with the wild-type protein by use of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATP-g-S. ATP-g-S, similar to ATP in E556Q E1201Q mutant, is occluded into the wild-type Pgp NBDs at 34-37C but not at 4C. When Pgp is occluded with ATP-g-S, it exhibits reduced affinity for transport substrates. Collectively, these data provide evidence for the ATP-driven dimerization and ADP-driven dissociation of the NBDs and although, two ATP molecules may initiate dimerization, only one is driven to an occluded pre-hydrolysis intermediate state. It appears that in a full-length ABC transporter like Pgp, the occluded nucleotide conformation at one of the NBDs provides the power-stroke at the transport-substrate site. In collaboration with John Golin (The Catholic Univ. of America), we characterized the ATPase activity of the yeast Pdr5p transporter that effluxes a variety of xenobiotic compounds. Pdr5p-specific ATPase activity shows complete, concentration-dependent inhibition by clotrimazole, which is known to be a potent transport substrate, however both GTPase and UTPase activities are relatively resistant to this drug. Our results indicate that this inhibition is noncompetitive and caused by the interaction of clotrimazole with the transporter at a site that is distinct from the ATP-binding domains. We propose that Pdr5p increases its transport substrate specificity by using more than one nucleotide as an energy source. 2. Development of potent natural product and other non-toxic modulators inhibitors of ABC transporters: To develop modulator(s) that will inhibit multiple transporters we screened synthetic compounds as well as natural products. The ABCG2 transporter confers resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents. One approach to combat MDR mediated by this transporter is the development of inhibitors modulators that block its function at non-toxic concentrations. We found that napthoquinones, vitamin K3 and its structural analogue plumbagin are substrates of ABCG2. Thus, ABCG2 may have a role in the regulation of vitamin K3 levels in the body. In addition, a thiosemicarbazone, NSC73306, which kills specifically Pgp expressing cells, was found to be a potent modulator of ABCG2. Thus, NSC73306 exhibits due mode of action that can be exploited to overcome drug resistance by eliminating Pgp-overexpressing cells and by acting as a potent modulator to resensitize ABCG2 expressing cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. In collaboration with Drs. Susan Bates, Curtis Henrich, Michael Dean and James McMahon (CCR and Molecular Targets Development Program, NCI) we have screened with a high-throughput assay a library of 7400 natural products and synthetic compounds to identify potent new inhibitors of ABCG2. We are also studying tyrosine kinase inhibitors for their potential use as inhibitors of ABC drug transporters. We found that the newly developed tyrosine kinase inhibitor AMN107 (nilotinib), and its parent drug imatinib (Gleevec) modulates activity of Pgp and ABCG2 by interacting at the drug-substrate binding sites instead of ATP sites as is the case with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In collaboration with Dr. Zhe-Sheng Chen (St. Johns Univ.), we have demonstrated that Erlotinib (Tarceva), which is an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, reverses Pgp and ABCG2-mediated resistance by directly inhibiting the efflux function of these transporters. 3. Resolution of three-dimensional structure of human Pgp: The resolution of the three-dimensional structure of Pgp is an ongoing project and for this we have developed a purification scheme that has yielded total protein 7.5-10 mg of more than 99% homogeneously pure Pgp at 10-12 mg ml concentration. For improving the crystallization of Pgp, we have initiated another approach where in the Fab of the conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibody, UIC2 is incubated along with the purified Pgp during crystallization. We have optimized the conditions to generate Fab of UIC2 with protein concentration in the range of 5-7 mg ml. Additional experiments demonstrate that Fab of UIC2 binds to Pgp in detergent solution under similar conditions that are used for generations of crystals indicating that it is feasible to generate co-crystals of Pgp and UIC2-Fab. At present we are in the process of generating 400-500 mg of UIC2 from the hybridoma cell line HB1287. This will allow us to prepare 150-200 mg of Fab for testing new crystallization conditions. 4. Molecular mechanism of drug resistance in single- and multi-step selection with anticancer agents in cancer cells: To understand the mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR) under clinical conditions, we have begun to examine how treatment regimens affect the expression of ABC drug transporters in single- and multi-step selection with anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin. We established single-step doxorubicin-selected MCF-7 sublines using very low concentrations, 14 or 21 nM. We have found that ABCC2, ABCC4 and ABCG2 were overexpressed at the mRNA level in these single-step selected sublines. Yet, only ABCC4 and ABCG2 were overexpressed at the protein level. Both 14 and 21 nM single-step doxorubicin-selected sublines exhibit nearly 5-fold resistance to doxorubicin compared to parental MCF-7 cells. However, as ABCC4 does not confer resistance to doxorubicin it is most likely that ABCG2 is the major transporter responsible for the development of resistance. We also observed by using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay that the upregulation of ABCG2 is facilitated by histone hyperacetylation. Interestingly, stem cell markers including CD44 and CD24 are not enriched in single-step clones of breast cancer cell line MCF-7 selected with low concentration (21 nM) of doxorubicin. These results indicate that the MDR phenotype arises following lose-dose, single-step exposure to doxorubicin, and further suggest that overexpression of ABCG2 by epigenetic changes may mediate early stages of MDR development. In another related study in collaboration with Lyuba Varticovski (CCR, NCI), we sought to determine whether cancer stem cells occur in BRCA1-associated breast cancer and contribute to therapeutic response. We observed that Brca-1-deficient mouse mammary tumors harbor heterogeneous cancer stem cell populations, and CD44+ CD24- cells represent a population that correlates with human breast cancer stem cells. 5. Characterization of Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes in ABCB1: In collaboration with Dr. Michael Gottesman we showed that in MDR1, synonymous SNPs in the context of a haplotype, with two synonymous (3435C>T & 1236C>T) and one non-synonymous (2677G>T) SNP, were associated with altered substrate and inhibitor specificity. Further recent work in collaboration with Drs. Gottesman and Nussinov (SAIC, Frederick Inc., and CCR, NCI) suggests that long- [summary truncated at 7800 characters]',\n",
       " 'Free radicals are ubiquitous in our body and are generated by normal physiological processes, including aerobic metabolism and inflammatory responses, to eliminate invading pathogenic microorganisms. Chronic inflammation can increase cancer risk. We are investigating the interaction between nitric oxide (NO&#8729;) and p53 as a crucial pathway in inflammatory-mediated carcinogenesis. We have shown previously that the p53 tumor suppressor network is a key responder to microenvironmental components of chronic inflammatory stress including nitric oxide, hydroxyl ions, hypoxia, and DNA replication arrest due to DNA damage by endogenous free radicals. Superoxide fluxes also limit nitric oxidend inactivates it by mutation of p53. Chronic inflammation activates the p53 tumor suppressor network and inactivates it by mutation of p53. Animal models are a critical facet of our integrative biology strategy, hence we have utilized genetic knockouts, e.g., p53 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, to investigate mechanisms of inflammation-associated cancer. Nitric oxide is involved in tumorigenesis. However, the quantity, redox-status, cell type and inflammatory microenvironment determine the pro- and anti-tumorigenic function of nitric oxide. Basal levels of nitric oxide delayed spontaneous tumor development in p53-deficient mice, when compared to mice lacking both p53 and nitric oxide synthase-2. This study provided genetic and mechanistic evidence that nitric oxide can suppress tumorigenesis. However, an inflammation-induced increase in the quantity of nitric oxide accelerated spontaneous tumor development in p53-deficient mice. An inflammatin-induced increase in nitric oxide production inhibited apoptosis and enhanced the production of immune suppressive regulatory T cells. These findings provide evidence that nitric oxide can be tumorigenic. Based on these observations, we propose a model of dose dependent modulation of tumorigenesis by nitric oxide under non-inflammatory and inflammatory microenvironment in a mouse model of cancer-prone Li-Fraumeni syndrome.',\n",
       " 'Application of comparative functional genomics to select mouse models to study human liver cancer: Genetically modified mice have been used extensively for analyzing the molecular events that occur during tumor development. However, in many instances, if not all, it is uncertain to what extent mouse models reproduce features observed in the corresponding human conditions. This uncertainty results largely from the lack of precise methods with which to directly and comprehensively compare mouse and human tumors at the molecular level. We have used global gene expression patterns of 68 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from seven different mouse models and 91 human HCC from predefined subclasses to compare molecular features of mouse and human HCC directly. Gene expression patterns in HCCs from Myc, E2f1 and Myc E2f1 transgenic mice are most similar to those of the better survival group (subclass B) of human HCC, whereas the expression patterns in HCC from Myc TGF-a transgenic mice and in diethylnitrosamine-induced mouse HCC are most similar to those of the poorer survival group (subclass A) of human HCC. Gene expression patterns in HCC from Acox1- - mice and from mice exposed to ciprofibrate are least similar to those observed in human HCC. We conclude that this approach, comparative functional genomics, can effectively identify mouse models that are most appropriate for the analysis of the molecular pathogenesis of human liver cancers. Comparative functional genomics may provide a general method for selecting the most relevant mouse models for other human cancers. Two distinct categories of liver cancer in transgenic mouse models are characterized by disruption of a-catenin pathway and genomic instability: Human liver cancer can be separated into two broad categories that are characterized by activation of a-catenin and genomic instability, respectively. We investigated the role of a-catenin activation and genomic instability in the sequential steps of mouse hepatocarcinogenesis. A large collection of preneoplastic and neoplastic liver lesions from c myc, TGFa, E2F1, c-myc TGFa and c-myc E2F1 transgenic mice were analyzed for mutations and deletions in the a-catenin gene by PCR and sequence screening. Activation of a-catenin was investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The RAPD method was used to assess the overall genomic instability in the same lesions. Chromosomal loci affected by genomic alterations were determined by microsatellite analysis. As a prognostic marker, expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was determined by IHC. Based on these characteristics, liver tumors from the transgenic mouse lines comprise two categories. The first category, exemplified by HCCs from c myc E2F1 transgenic mice, is characterized by a high frequency of a-catenin activation in the presence of a relatively stable genome and low AFP levels. The second category, represented by c-myc TGFa HCCs, has a low rate of a-catenin activation, but extensive genomic instability, with recurrent losses of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, X. In this group, genomic instability is evident from an early dysplastic stage and occurs concomitantly with elevated expression of AFP. Our data indicate that a-catenin activation and genomic instability define two major genetic events during development of mouse liver tumors, similar to those described for human HCCs, providing additional support for our opinion that these transgenic mice are suitable genetic models with which to elucidate the molecular features of human HCC. Vitamin E down-modulates iNOS and NADPH oxidase in c-Myc TGF-a transgenic mouse model of liver cancer: Co-expression of c-Myc and TGFa in the mouse liver accelerates hepatocarcinogenesis and enhances DNA damage due to chronic oxidative stress.',\n",
       " \"2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo 4,5-b pyridine (PhIP) is a suspected human breast carcinogen found in cooked meat that induces mammary gland cancer in rats. By real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, PhIP-induced rat mammary gland carcinomas showed statistically higher expression of the G1 S cyclin D1 (5-fold) and its kinase partner Cdk4 (37-fold) in comparison to normal mammary gland, while cyclin D2, cyclin D3, and Cdk6 were not statistically changed. Amplification of cyclin D1 was observed by real-time PCR in 24% of carcinomas (15 of 63). Only 1 of 47 carcinomas showed Cdk4 amplification. By Western blotting, the level of phospho-Rb was over 2-fold higher in carcinomas than in normal mammary gland. By immunohistochemical analysis, cyclin D1, Cdk4, and phospho-Rb nuclear protein expression was 5.7, 3.9 and 2.3-fold higher in carcinomas than in normal mammary gland, whereas the expression of cyclin D2, cyclin D3 and Cdk6 was similar. Among carcinomas, Cdk4 and phospho-Rb levels were positively correlated with cell proliferation. Previous studies by this laboratory indicated that these carcinomas harbor a high frequency of H-ras mutations. The H-ras pathway is known to be linked to the cell cycle via cyclin D1. The results from the current study implicate cyclin D1 Cdk4, phospho-Rb as a central pathway in PhIP-induced rat mammary gland carcinogenesis.Previous studies using comparative genomic hybridization have indicated that PhIP-induced rat mammary gland carcinomas harbor loss of the centromeric region of 2q, a region known to carry the mammary carcinoma susceptibility 1 gene and other genes potentially important for carcinogenesis. Using a polymerase chain reaction based assay, allelic imbalance, including microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity, was evaluated in eleven mammary carcinomas induced by PhIP in Sprague-Dawley x Wistar Furth F1 hybrid rats in 34 microsatellite markers putatively coinciding to 2q11-14. Nine of the 34 markers revealed allelic imbalance, the frequency varying from 10- 100% depending on the specific marker. None of the markers showing allelic imbalance, however, coincided with the MCS1 gene locus, suggesting that alterations in this loci were not associated with PhIP-induced rat mammary gland cancer. The expression of several genes physically mapped to 2q11-14 and potentially involved in carcinogenesis including Cyclin H, Ras-GRF2, RasGAP, Cyclin B1, Pi3kr1, Il6st, was also examined by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a large bank of PhIP-induced Sprague-Dawley rat mammary gland carcinomas. By realtime PCR, the expression of RASGAP, Pi3Kp85, Ccnh, and IL6 in carcinomas was respectively 26-, 20-, 3-, and 3-fold higher in carcinomas than in control mammary gland tissue (p<0.05, Student's t-test). A statistically six-fold lower expression of RasGrf2 was detected in carcinomas, whereas no significant change in CCNB1 expression was observed. The findings from RT-PCR were further confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of mammary gland carcinomas and normal mammary gland using specific antibodies. For each gene examined, the change in expression by RT-PCR was shown to correspond to altered expression as detected by immunohistochemistry. The proliferation index in mammary gland carcinomas was also assessed by PCNA immunostaining and shown to correlate with the over-expression of cyclin H (P<0.05, Spearman Rank Order Correlation). The results indicate that multiple genes and loci residing in the centromeric region of chromosome 2 show alterations in PhIP-induced rat mammary gland carcinomas.\",\n",
       " 'In the past year significant progress has been made in the molecular cytogenetics and molecular biology of cancer cells. We obtained information on chromosome alterations in several novel cancer model systems, provided further evidence regarding the role of DLC family genes in cancer development, and identified TMEM7 as a potential tumor suppressor in HCC. The heat shock transcription factor Hsf1 regulates expression of heat shock proteins and, as such, protects cells against apoptosis triggered by protein damaging agents. To understand the role of Hsf1 in tumorigenesis, hsf1- - mice were crossed with p53- - mice to analyze p53-mediated tumorigenesis in the presence or absence of the hsf1 gene. While p53- - mice develop mostly lymphomas, hsf1- -p53- - mice develop mostly testicular cancers and sarcomas - yet both succumb to their respective tumors by the age of 35 weeks. We demonstrated by spectral karyotyping analysis (SKY) that loss of the hsf1 gene increased genomic instability in mouse embryo fibroblasts from hsf1- -p53- - animals. This suggests that the loss of Hsf1 in mice already deficient for p53 gene promotes an increase in genomic instability that triggers a change in the program of neoplastic transformation that favors the formation of solid tumors over lymphomas. In addition to its major function removal of topological stress in DNA associated with replication, transcription, repair and recombination - human topoisomerase 1 (Top1) has been proposed to play a role in many other important processes. Since total elimination of Top1 is lethal, stable Top1 small interfering RNA derivatives (siTop1) of colon and breast carcinoma cell lines were generated. Reduction of Top1 availability resulted in altered expression of 55 different genes, increased genomic instability (as demonstrated by SKY analysis) and decreased nucleolus organizing region (NOR) activity (demonstrated by controlled chromosomal silver-staining assay) and formation of histone H2A.X foci associated with replication. Taken together, these findings point to a non-classical role of Top1 in maintenance of genomic integrity, gene-specific regulation of transcription, and the response to various anticancer agents. The most compelling characteristic of cells acting as self-renewing mammary gland stem cells (MGSC) is their ability to reconstitute a differentiated mammary gland in vivo following implantation into cleared mammary gland fat pads. In recent years the ability of such cells to grow as nonadherent, free-floating-mammospheres has become an in vitro test of their MGSC function. Using specific immunostaining and FACS, several fractions of mouse mammary gland cells with specific surface marker signatures were isolated and showed to be able to both form mammospheres and to regenerate mammary gland on implantation into a mammary fat pad. Culturing of those cells changes their immunophenotype and also affects their genomic stability, as evidenced by SKY analysis of freshly isolated and precultured samples, opening the possibility that accumulation of somatic alterations in MGSC may be a factor in tumorigenesis. We have continued our studies on DLC1, a Rho GTPase activating protein and tumor suppressor originally isolated in the Molecular Cytogenetics Section. To learn more about the molecular mechanisms by which DLC1 influences cell behavior, we entered into a partnership with Myriad Genetics to use yeast two-hybrid screening to identify proteins that interact with DLC1. A number of potential DLC1 binding partners were found, including 3 members of the tensin family of focal adhesion proteins (tensin1, tensin2, and tensin3), which act as a link between the actin cytoskeleton and the cytoplasmic tails of integrins. The tensin1 binding site of DLC1 was characterized by Dr. Douglas Lowygroup, who demonstrated that mutation of a critical residue (Y442) abolished tensin1 binding, eliminated the focal adhesion localization of DLC1, and reduced its ability to inhibit cell migration and growth in soft agar We had used gene targeting to generate DLC1 knockout mice and found that gene is essential for normal development, as Dlc1- - embryos died at midgestation. Since the embryonic lethality precluded attempts at studying the role of DLC1 at later stages of development and during tumorigenesis in adult tissues, we set out to produce a conditional DLC1 knockout strain to allow tissue-specific inactivation of the gene using Cre-LoxP technology. In collaboration with Dr. Snorri Thorgeirsson, Dr. Douglas Lowy, and the Gene Targeting Facility at NCI-Frederick, we have successfully obtained mouse embryonic stem cells that carried the correctly targeted conditional allele and were able to generate chimeric mice. Breeding of the chimeras to identify offspring with germline transmission of the conditional allele is currently underway. DLC1 is the founding member of a family of closely related Rho GTPase activating proteins that have tumor suppressor properties. The DLC2 gene on chromosome 13q13 had been shown by others to be down-regulated in HCC, and we demonstrated that its expression is also reduced in several other common human cancers. We also characterized a novel gene on chromosome Xq13 that encodes DLC3, a third member of the DLC family that is around 50% identical to DLC-1 and DLC-2. The DLC3 mRNA was widely expressed in normal tissues, but was down-regulated in a number of human cancer cell lines and in primary tumors from kidney, lung, ovary, breast, and prostate. Transfection of human breast and prostate cancer cells with a DLC3 expression vector inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and growth in soft agar, indicating that DLC3 may act as a tumor suppressor in these tissues. In addition, DLC3 was found to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by RhoA and to bind tensin1. Both genetic and environmental factors are important in the development and prevention of breast cancer. Among such external factors, diet is thought to play an important role. A low incidence of breast cancer in Asia has been attributed in part to a high intake of flavonoids. Flavone treatment restored DLC1 expression in aggressive breast and colon carcinoma cell lines that were DLC-1- negative due to promoter hypermethylation and also inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and lead to deregulation of several proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor genes. The results obtained with cells from aggressive or metastatic breast tumors suggest the possibility that administration of flavone, alone or in combination with DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors, may be an effective adjunct to chemotherapy. The TMEM7 gene, which encodes a transmembrane protein, is among the candidate tumor suppressor genes located at a region of deletion 3p21.3 in various cancers. This gene is expressed specifically in the liver, and the Tmem7 protein shares substantial sequence homology with human and mouse 28-kDa interferon-alpha (IFN-&#945;) responsive protein. We investigated the role of TMEM7 in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and demonstrated down-regulation or silencing of the gene is due aberrant DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, in the absence of genomic deletion and mutation. Ectopic expression of TMEM7 in HCC lines suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration in vitro and reduced tumor formation in nude mice. Treatment of two highly invasive HCC cell lines with IFN-&#945; for 7 days significantly increased TMEM7 expression and inhibited cell migration. These observations implicate loss of TMEM7 expression in hepatocarcinogenesis and suggest that modification of TMEM7 expression by IFN-&#945; may have potential therapeutic relevance in a subset of HCC',\n",
       " '<P>Our previous crystallographic studies on b4Gal-T1 and of the mutant Met340His-b4Gal-T1 in complex with chitobiose and various trisaccharides, together with the enzyme kinetic analysis and MD simulations defined the oligosaccharide binding site of b4Gal-T1 (see Project #s Z01 BC 009304). For a better understanding of the branch specificity of b4Gal-T1 towards the GlcNAc residues of N-glycans, the kinetic and crystallographic studies with the wild-type human b4Gal-T1 (h-b4Gal-T1) and the mutant Met340His-b4Gal-T1 (h-M340H-b4Gal-T1), in complex with a GlcNAc containing pentasaccharide and several GlcNAc containing trisaccharides present in N-glycans, showed that b4Gal-T1 preferentially interacts with the 1,2-1,6-arm trisaccharide rather than with the 1,2-1,3-arm or 1,4-1,3-arm of a bi- or tri-antennary oligosaccharide chain of N-glycan (see 2006 project # Z01 BC 010041) In the present studies we are determining the transfer to a biantennary oligosaccharide of a glycoprotein e. IgG. < p><P><i><b> Transfer preferences of b4Gal-T1 to the 1-3 or 1-6 arm of a biantennary glycan < i>< b>: We showed, using synthetic trisaccharides as acceptor model systems, that the acceptor 1,2-1,3-arm (GlcNAc-b1,2-Man-a1,3-Man) and 1,4-1,3-arm (GlcNAc-b1,4-Man-a1,3-Man) trisaccharides have a 10- to 60-fold higher K<sub>m< sub> for b4Gal-T1 than the 1,2-1,6-arm trisaccharide (GlcNAc-b1,2-Man-a1,6-Man), latter shows substrate inhibition at concentrations that are much lower than for other acceptor substrates. Now we are investigating which antenna of a biantennary glycan will be a preferred acceptor for the b4Gal-T1, so that we can establish the conditions by which the galactosylation of one or both antennas of an N-glycan of a glycoprotein, e.g., IgG, occur. To investigate this, we have first analyzed by MS analysis the transfer of galactose to various biantennary oligosaccharide acceptors: Agalacto-Lacto-N-neo-Hexaose, a pentasaccharide, and a heptasaccharide-peptide, available from Dextra Labs (MALDI analysis carried out by the Protein Chemistry Lab, SAIC-NCI-Frederick). MS analyses of the product after the transfer of galactose to Agalacto-Lacto-N-neo-Hexaose (LNnH) (MW of 773), at different times of incubation (10 min 2 hours), and at low (0.1 mM) and high (1 mM) concentrations of the oligosaccharide acceptor, show that at 0.1 mM acceptor concentration, after two hours of incubation, most of the galactose is transferred to both arms, resulting in a product with a predominant MW of 1096 Daltons. At 1 mM concentration of the acceptor and two hours of incubation time, however, galactose is transferred mainly to one arm, the product having a predominant MW of 933. To establish which antenna, 1-3-arm or 1-6-arm, or both, is galactosylated at these concentrations we have, in collaboration with Dr. Timothy Weybright (from Dr. Timothy Veenstras group, of the Mass Spectrometry Center, BPP, SAIC-Frederick, Inc.), analyzed the oligosaccharide products by MS MS analysis and established that at high concentrations only 1-3-arm is galactosylated. We are currently following the transfer of galactose to de-sialated, de-galactosylated monoclonal antibodies, Asialo-agalacto-IgG, which carry a single N-linked oligosaccharide chain on each heavy chain of the IgG at the Fc-region. After the transfer of galactose, the MALDI analyses of the oligosaccharides show that certain conditions favor the transfer to only one arm while other conditions transfer to both arms of the antenna. Currently we are analyzing by MS MS analysis the arm specificity when galactose is transferred mainly to one arm.< p> <P><i><b>Crystal structure of the h-M340H-Gal-T1 in complex with the disaccharide GlcNAc-b3Gal-b-O-napthalenemethanol < i>< b>: A class of synthetic disaccharides has been shown as potential inhibitors of tumor metastasis by Dr. Jeff Eskos lab in UC, San Diego. They are high affinity substrates for b4GalT1 and thus act as decoys for the synthesis of sialyl Lewis X (sLeX ), the cell adhesion epitope, which is expressed at elevated levels in metastatic cells. The most effective compound they have identified to date is GlcNAc-b3Gal-b-O-napthalenemethanol. The acetylated compound is taken up by the cells, O-deacetylated, and then the disaccharide decoys the synthesis of sLeX-containing glycans on cell surface glycoconjugates. In several model systems this results in an inhibition of tumor formation. As Dr. Eskos lab has observed, all the activity of the compound depends on the action of b4GalT(s) in the cell, since the first step in its utilization involves galactosylation. In their in vitro studies with GlcNAc-b3Gal-b-O-napthalenemethanol as an acceptor substrate for b4Gal-T1, they show a K<sub>m< sub> of 10 M. This high affinity for the enzyme may be its unique mode of binding to b4Gal-T1 similar to the one we have observed with the 1,2-1,6-arm trisaccharide (see above). We have carried the crystal structure of h-M340H-Gal-T1 with GlcNAc-b3Gal-b-O-napthalenemethanol, provided by Dr. Eskos lab, and determined the mode of interaction between the disaccharide and the enzyme. The overall binding of GnGl-NP to the Met344His-Cys342Thr-Gal-T1 molecule is quite similar to the binding of the tri-saccharide GlcNAcb1-2Mana1-6Mana, observed earlier (see 2006 project # Z01 BC 010041), suggesting its K<sub>m< sub> for the enzyme will be similar to that of the 1-6 arm tri-saccharide, a K<sub>m< sub> of 60 M. This tri-saccharide is derived from the 1-6 arm of the biantennary N-glycan, starting from the core mannose to the free GlcNAc at the non-reducing end. In the enzyme-bound 1-6 arm tri-saccharide, the middle mannose exhibits the least interactions with the protein molecule, while the terminal mannose (i.e., the core mannose residue of the biantennary N-glycans) makes extensive stacking interactions with the aromatic side chain of the Tyr282 residue.In contrast, the beta-linked Gal residue in the disaccharide GnGl-NP forms extensive stacking interactions with Tyr282, and the terminal aromatic naphthalene residue makes additional interactions, although weak, in the oligosaccharide binding site of the b4Gal-T1 molecule. Therefore, due to the additional interactions that arise from the naphthalene moiety, it is expected that GnGl-NP disaccharide will have a lower Km than that of the 1-6 arm tri-saccharide, thus making it the best known acceptor substrate with the highest affinity for b4Gal-T1. Furthermore, the b4Gal-T family members T5 and T6 have the conserved residue Tyr corresponding to the Phe356 residue of the b4Gal-T1. The Tyr residue in these family members is expected to make additional hydrogen bonding interactions via the side-chain hydroxyl group of the Tyr residue, which is expected to further lower the Km of the GnGl-NP disaccharide for b4Gal-T5 and b4Gal-T6. From the crystal structure analysis we are able to understand the high affinity of the disaccharide GnGl-NP for b4Gal-T1. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that future chemical modifications, such as incorporating the structural water molecule in the acceptor design, amino or methylated amino group at the second position of Gal or even appropriate substitutions of polar groups at the naphthalene ring, may improve the affinity of the acceptor substrate and lead to better design of the disaccharide inhibitors for the tumor metastasis.< p',\n",
       " 'A major goal of this project is to develop mathematical models describing biological systems of importance for understanding the molecular mechanisms of cancer with applications to therapy. We initiated the development of two models: 1) effects of telomerase inhibitors on tumor growth and 2) kinetics of G1 to S transition in cancer cells. The telomerase is an attractive target for anticancer therapy. Unlike other anticancer drugs the telomerase inhibitor effect is delayed because cells would enter crisis and eventually die only after certain number of cell doublings related to the telomere length at the time of inhibition. In the simplest case of homogeneous telomeres the inhibitory time delay, T, equals Rtd, where R=(L-Lcr) l is the cell replication capacity, L and Lcr being the telomere lengths at the time of inhibition and at crisis (about 1.5 kb), respectively, l is the telomere length decrease per each cell division (about 0.1 kb) and td - the doubling time of the tumor cells. Because td varies from several days to more than several months while R may be in the range of several to one hundred divisions T may range from weeks to years. We developed more sophisticated kinetic models, based on the solution of a system of differential equations, which take into account the telomere heterogeneity and the kinetics of tumor growth as described by the exponential, logistic and Gompertz equations. Two results are of particular importance: 1) The telomere heterogeneity decreases the delay time T; for example, one of the models predicted that the time at which the tumor volume in the presence of inhibitors is half of that without inhibitors equals td(R)1 2, and 2) The tumor growth kinetics affects the delay time in a complex way in dependence on the kinetic constants and the telomere size distribution, but always leads to a relative increase in the number of cells which had the longest telomeres before treatment. While these models may predict the order of magnitude of the delay time and help in organizing our knowledge about the factors affecting the tumor growth in presence of telomerase inhibitors, only further experimental results on tumor telomere lengths and the kinetics of their reduction will allow a more accurate prediction of the kinetics of tumor growth. We also initiated the development of a mathematical model of the G1 to S transition based on the molecular diagrams proposed by K. Kohn. The study of this complex system now is in progress. ',\n",
       " 'There is a need to easily publish data in a way that is immediately accessible to the scientific community who have access to the Internet. We have developed a simple database search engine dbEngine which is being used to quickly create a searchable database on World Wide Web (WWW) servers. Data can be prepared from spreadsheet programs (Excel, etc.) or from tables exported from relational database systems. This Common Gateway Interface (CGI-BIN) program is used with a WWW server such as available commercially, or from NCSA or CERN. Its capabilities include: 1) searching records by combinations of terms connected with ANDs or ORs; 2) returning search results as hypertext links to other WWW database servers; 3) mapping lists of literature reference identifiers to the full references; 4) creating bidirectional hypertext links between pictures and the database. DbEngine was developed for the MitoDat database (Mendelian and non-Mendelian Inheritance associated with the Mitochondrion) Lemkin P. F., et al., Electrophoresis 17(2): 556-72, 1996 (http: www-lecb.ncifcrf.gov mitoDat ). We also established a phosphoprotein database (http: www-lecb.ncifcrf.gov phosphoDB ) as well as several other protein databases. The locations of proteins may be visualized by 2D gel electrophoresis maps. Interactive 2D maps also let the user access specific database entries directly by clicking on proteins. We have also used dbEngine in our 2DWG meta-database of 2D gel images found in Internet databases (http: www- lecb.ncifcrf.gov 2dwgDB ). These databases consolidate information from the various biological databases, eg. GenBank, Swiss-Prot, GDB, OMOM, etc. Our collaborators periodically update the database. ',\n",
       " \"Scientists around the world often work on similar data so the need to share results and compare data arises periodically. We describe a method of comparing image of two similar samples created in different laboratories to help identify or suggest protein spot identification. Now that 2D gels and associated databases (DB) frequently appear on the Internet, this opens up the possibility of visually comparing one's own experimental 2D gel image data with data from another gel in a remote Internet DB. In general, there are a few ways to compare images: 1) slide one autoradiograph or stained gel over the other while back- illuminated; or 2) build a 2D gel computer DB from both gels after scanning and analyzing these gels. These are impractical since in the former case, the gel from the Internet DB is not locally available, while the costs of building a full DB is excessive if only a single visual comparison is needed. We describe a distributed gel comparison program (URL:http: www-lecb.ncifcrf.gov flicker) which runs on any Web browser and is invoked by clicking on a request from the web browser. One image is read from any Internet 2D gel DB (eg.SWISS-2DPAGE) and the other from the investigator's computer. Images may be more easily compared by first applying spatial warping or other transforms. As the two possibly transformed images are rapidly alternated, or flickered, in the same window, the user can slide one image past the other to visually align corresponding spots or regions by matching local morphology. This flicker-comparison technique may be applied to analyzing other types of 1D and 2D biomedical images. We have developed a 2DWG meta-database of 2D gel images found on the Web and integrated it with Flicker to make it easier to compare images (http:www- lecb.ncifcrf.gov 2dwgDB ). \",\n",
       " 'The determination of motifs that classify entries in a database is important especially when one has minimal information concerning the motifs that determine a specific family. This project, a form of datamining, revolves around the concept of computationally finding the largest approximately identical substructures in a set of data objects. These discovered substructures or motifs are then tested against the data to see how well they characterize the data in the sense of being good classifiers. The database of objects can consist of entities such as sequences, trees, graphs or records. We have applied these classification techniques to biological databases in the following three areas: 1) 3-D graphs representing bio-molecules. We were able to show a 91% precision rate in determing motifs to classify three different families of molecules. Z01 BC 10045-02 LMMB to LECB 2) tree structures representing RNA secondary structure. We were able to discover tree motifs that classified three families of RNA structures. 3) strings representing protein sequences. Using five methods for, protein sequence classification, one being our own, we found that the five methods gave information which is complementary to each other. Thus, using the five methods together, one can obtain high confidence classifications or suggest alternative hypotheses. ',\n",
       " 'Basic studies of the solvation and ion stabilization of three stranded and four stranded nucleic acid structures continued. New applications of these studies included: 1. Novel atom-atom potential functions were developed for interactions of phosphates with sodium and potassium ions. These potentials will be used to simulate three and four stranded DNA and RNA helices under various conditions. 2. The recombination triplex in the complex with RecA protein calculated by us earlier (denoted R-form DNA) was studied by a novel method based on the radioactive decay of 125I, incorporated into cytosine. The low energy electrons emitted caused DNA cleavage, leading to estimates of the distances between the DNA strands and the Iodine atom. Cleavage results agree with our model predicting the recognition between the DNA duplex and the position of the third strand in the major groove. 3. The same method was applied for studying the mutual positions of the two DNA strands and the newly synthesized RNA strand in the complex with RNA polymerase. The results indicate formation of a stable about 10 bp long duplex between the transcribed DNA strand and RNA. The average distance from the more flexible non-transcribed strand to RNA is estimated at 15- 20+. This information will be used in planning new experiments to elucidate the role of the non-transcribed strand in increasing the fidelity of transcription. 4. A new project has been initiated to study the R-form triplex in solution. This is based on the synthesis of oligonucleotides with non- nucleotide linkers which stabilize the formation of intramolecular triplexes at relatively low concentrations, avoiding aggregation. This method allows us to discriminate unambiguously between parallel and anti-parallel triplexes. Preliminary calorimetric studies showed that the R-like parallel triplex is stable at sub-room temperatures. This leads to the possibility of determining the structure of the parallel triplex by NMR.

       " 'The goal of this project is to identify mechanisms mediating effects of endogenous TGF-beta1 on the development and function of specific hematopoietic cell lineages. Experimental evidence from in vitro studies of function suggest a critical role for TGF-beta1 in regulating myelopoiesis and immune cell function, but such studies are limited by their inability to reproduce the complex in vivo network which ordinarily influences the genesis and function of these cell populations. Our approach to this problem has been to utilize the TGF-beta1(- -) mouse as the basis for establishing complimentary in vivo model systems; each system designed to isolate TGF-beta1-deficiency in a distinct background. This approach has enabled us to identify critical links between cell cycle control by TGF-beta1, immune cell maturation and function, and hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation, as they occur in vivo. Examples include our demonstration of myeloid hyperplasia as a distinct phenotype in TGF-beta1(- -) mice, and recognition that altered expression of several regulators of the cell cycle may be critical in the establishment of the autoimmune process which evolves in the absence of endogenous TGF-beta1 expression. Through adoptive transfer studies, including bone marrow transplant experiments and studies of thymic and splenic reconstitution in nude mice, we have also identified novel autocrine effects of TGF-beta1 and their role in the autoimmune and hematopoietic manifestations of TGF-beta1-deficiency. We have also determined that TGF-beta1-deficient animals lack epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) and gp40 positive dendritic cells (DC) in lymph nodes, suggesting that lymphoid DC as well as LC are perturbed. We aim to study DC populations in TGF-beta1(- -) mice, including MHC-II(- -) and athymic nude strains developed in our lab, and to determine precise mechanisms by which TGF-beta1 regulates DC ontogeny. Our current and future research aims to define both the cellular and molecular mechanisms which mediate these effects, particularly those which govern cell cycle progression and the growth inhibitory responses to TGF-beta.

       " 'Mutation of the TGF-beta type II receptor gene and the development of resistance to TGF-beta represent relatively late events in the process of carcinogenesis and may make a key contribution to the transition from late adenoma to frank malignancy. Previously, we reported a correlation between resistance to TGF-beta in human gastric cancer cell lines and gross structural abnormalities of the TGF-beta type II receptor gene. We have also established a correlation between microsatellite instability and TGF-beta RII gene mutations in human gastric carcinoma. A screen of the gastric cancer cell lines included in our previous study has detected microsatellite instability in two cell lines, SNU-1 and -638. Both cell lines are resistant to TGF-beta and demonstrate undetectable levels of TGF-beta RII transcripts. Similarly, we have screened genomic DNAs from several other types of malignancy for the presence of microsatellite instability. Despite the occurrence of defective DNA repair in these other tumor types (osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma), TGF-beta-RII mutations were not identified. This result suggests that association between defective DNA mismatch repair and mutation of TGF-beta RII may be a feature of only selected carcinogenic pathways which include those for colon and gastric cancer and that the relationship is not a general phenomenon shared by all types of malignancy. In many cases, resistance to TGF-beta in human cancer cells cannot be explained by receptor system defects. We have studied several TGF-beta resistant cell lines which fail to express TGF-beta type II receptor protein, but have no identifiable mutation in the TGF-beta RII structural gene. In several cases, Northern analysis demonstrated low or undetectable levels of TGF-beta RII mRNA, introducing the possibility that abnormalities of TGF-beta RII transcriptional regulation may also contribute to the development of resistance to TGF- beta in cancer. We have cloned and characterized the TGF-beta RII promoter. The promoter region contains two positive regulatory elements and two negative regulatory elements in addition to the core promoter element. Preliminary evidence suggests that cancer cells might display differences in transcription factors which bind to regulatory elements in the TGF-beta RII promoter. ',\n",
       " \"Investigation of a secreted, Frizzled-related protein (FRP) is a major focus of current research. Frizzled proteins recently were shown to function as receptors for Wnt signaling molecules. We have now established that FRP can antagonize Wnt- dependent duplication of the dorsal axis in early Xenopus embryos. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) identified the frp locus at chromosome 8p11.1-12, a site where loss of heterozygosity has been observed in a variety of human malignancies. Thus, efforts are underway to determine whether frp mutations or deletions are present in tumor specimens, consistent with a potential role for FRP as a tumor suppressor. Ongoing structure-function analysis of HGF SF has benefited from prokaryotic expression of various truncated derivatives, including HGF NK1, HGF NK2, the first kringle and the amino-terminal (N) domain. NMR structure analysis of the N domain is in an advanced stage. A study was completed that demonstrated increased expression of HGF SF in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease; HGF SF protein is found in astrocytes and microglia, rather than in the neurofibrillary tangle, suggesting that HGF SF is produced in reaction to the underlying lesion associated with this disorder. KGF expression was observed in blood vessels in vivo and in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro, although transcripts encoding KGF tyrosine kinase receptors were not detected in vessels, vascular smooth muscle or endothelial cells. This result suggested that KGF might have activity on cells in the circulatory system, although the precise target and the nature of the receptor remain obscure. FISH analysis revealed that a portion of the kgf gene was amplified and dispersed among many chromosomes in discrete steps during the evolution of great apes and humans. The pattern of distribution of kgf-like sequences suggested that alphoid DNA was involved in their amplification and dispersion, emphasizing the likely importance of alphoid DNA in genetic recombination events.

       " 'The goal of this project is to better understand the effects of host cells and other co factors of human retroviral and pathogenesis. Viral-cell interactions both at the surface and intracellularly can alter the delicate balance of regulatory controls of normal cellular processes such as cytokine production and or action leading to pathogenic consequences. Like cells, the enveloped viruses contain a complex set of protein, carbohydrates and lipids on their cell surface. Recent evidence suggests that multiple interactions between molecular determinants of viruses and cells are needed for efficient viral fusion and entry. Some of these attachment factors for HIV entry can be glycosylaminoglycans and glycosphingolipids. We have shown at least two different glycosphingolipids on primary T cells can be used for HIV infectivity. Since viral entry inhibitors have become important anti-HIV compounds, we recently reported that peptide T (derived from an octapeptide gp120 sequence near the V2-stem), is a potent anti-viral entry inhibitor for early passage patient R5 or R5 X4 isolates, as well as laboratory R5 strains like BaL. Peptide T blocks infection by inhibiting entry, primarily through R5 receptors by interfering with gp120 binding to R5. We are determining if peptide T disrupts formation of the CD4 gp120 complex, the binding of gp120 to R5, or other attachment factors or by multiple interactions. Intracellular interactions between HIV and host proteins can either lead to suppressing viral production or activating latent HIV reservoirs of immune cells. We have previously identified two mechanisms that activate expression of latent HIV provirus, immune activation and hypomethylation. On the other hand, acute HIV infection leads to an increased cellular capacity to methylate cellular and viral genes through increase activity of DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1). Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is one cellular gene that is methylated during HIV infection. This hypermethylation leads to a decreased IFN expression, decreased type1 immune response and increased viral spread. HIV proviral integration is not necessary for stimulating these on methyaltion. Some 49 96 patients on long term HAART therapy have greatly diminished ability to produce IFN-gamma that can be restored though hypomethylation of the IFN-gamma promoter. Bisulfite genomic sequencing has shown that the IFN gamma promoter can remain hypermethylated during HAART therapy. Unlike HIV, little is known about the requirements for HTLV-I entry. We are determining the interactions between the HTLV envelope proteins and host cell proteins that are critical for efficient binding and entry. Using a soluble form of the envelope of the human retrovirus HTLV-I, we found that expression of a cell surface protein critical for viral entry is increased during immune activation. In addition, we identified nave CD4+ T cells as the first human cell type not possessing detectable HTLV-I binding protein(s). This HTLV-I SU binding protein may play a role in normal immune function as the HTLV-I SU is a potent inhibitor of a mixed leukocyte reaction. In addition to genetic and biochemical approaches to identify residues on the envelope protein that are involved in viral binding, we are also identifying cell-surface molecules that play a critical role in HTLV entry, either as primary receptors or as attachment factors. We have recently determined that cholesterol depletion on the membrane dramatically reduces entry, and that unlike most retroviruses, polycations inhibit HTLV Env binding and entry suggesting that HTLV-1 has either novel entry factors or new structural complexes.',\n",
       " 'Cytokines have potent effects controlling the proliferation, survival (anti-apoptotic), and drug resistance of a considerably diverse spectrum of tumor cells. Without doubt, the most rigorously studied cytokine which affects these biological processes in a variety of tumor cells, is the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. While there is accumulating basic and clinical research data to suggest that inflammation promotes neoplasia, IL-6 may stand as a centerpiece in the process. Our studies in 2005 are summarized below.1)We have studied the signal and molecular pathways by which IL-6 facilitates the growth and drug resistance in human myeloma cells. We identified the STAT3 pathway as a major pathway involved in the growth of these cells and have blocked this pathway by intervening with two different nuclear receptor mechanisms involving estrogen receptors and PPARg, each blocking through differing mechanisms. A large number of tumor cells, including prostate, multiple myeloma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, pancreatic carcinoma, etc. secrete and respond to IL-6. The mechanisms are unknown. We have cloned the 2.1 kb human IL-6 promoter, extensively mutated, and studied the regulation of this promoter in autocrine human prostate carcinoma and multiple myeloma cell lines. We have identified critical transcription factors for each type of cancer cell line that govern the transcriptional regulation and secretion of IL-6. We have also studied molecular aspects which regulate IL-6 secretion from bone marrow stromal cells, a major source of endogenous IL-6, and are currently developing strategies to block IL-6 production either genetically or pharmacologically. 2)Development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of breast cancer. Based on experience in studies on the estrogen receptors (ER) in our laboratory, we have focused our research towards the development of new intervention strategies for the treatment of breast cancer at the level of ER DNA binding, rather than classical antagonism of estrogen binding. Estrogen receptors contain zinc finger motifs required for their DNA binding and transcriptional activity. We have discovered that certain electrophilic reagents covalently modify ER zinc fingers resulting in the ejection of zinc and selective inactivation of estrogen receptors. This year we have extended these finding to screen for more water soluble compounds and also tested them against Tamoxifen resistant tumor cells. A hallmark of current Tamoxifen tratment of breast tumors is that they almost always develop resistance. We have recently, discovered that our compound will, in fact, reverse the resistance of human breast cancer lines to Tamoxifen both in vitro and in vivo.3)IL-6 regulation of epigenetic gene silencing. Among the molecular and cellular aspects IL-6 may have on promoting neoplasia, we have discovered that IL-6 may also regulate and maintain gene silencing by facilitating gene promoter CpG methylation. IL-6 was shown to silence the tumor suppressor gene p53 in a significant number of human multiple myeloma cell lines. Four genes also known to participate in DNA repair were also shown to be silenced, thus impairing the myeloma cells to repair genetic damage. Also. MnSOD was shown to be silenced by promoter methylation in human multiple myelomas and pancreatic carcinomas, disabling the management of the endogenous mutagenic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, epigenetic silencing may contribute to the major mutational and chromosomal damage that accumulates during the neoplastic process.',\n",
       " 'A number of observations have suggested that host lymphocytes, specifically cytotoxic T cells (CTL) play a significant role in mediating allogeneic marrow graft rejection. In a murine model system, CTL were cloned from the spleens of sublethally irradiated animals which had rejected MHC disparate marrow grafts. It was found that cloned CTL were sufficient to effect rejection of T cell depleted allogeneic marrow in lethally irradiated animals. The rejection of marrow grafts by CTL was specific for the MHC gene products expressed by the marrow cells and correlated with the cytotoxic specificity of the individual clones. Because host CTL in isolation could reject donor marrow grafts, the ability of cell popula-tions which could suppress host CTL responses to regulate marrow engraftment was studied. Cells with a specific type of suppressor activity, termed veto cells, which might regulate host rejection responses and also mediate self tolerance, have been reported to be present in marrow, and an ability of IL-2 to enhance the activity of veto suppressor cell populations was found. Such cells enhanced engraftment of MHC-mismatched, T cell depleted marrow in vivo. It was found that veto cells exerted their effect by clonal deletion of precursor CTL, and that such clonal elimination involved an active participation by precursor CTL. Specifically, triggering of veto cells was found to be mediated by target cell activation with release of cytolysin which was sufficient to trigger veto cells. Recent studies have found a differential expression of cytolysin by T cell subset and with time indicating a possible new role for cytolysin in the maintenance of self tolerance.In other studies, the administration of IL-2 was found to inhibit receptor mediated signalling of CTL. This inhibition was associated with impaired calcium flux and alterations in cytokine signaling as well. ',\n",
       " 'Mechanisms by which T cell populations are generated are relevant to considerations of immunoreconstitution in situations in which T cell depletion occurs. Studies in rhesus monkeys investigating T cell generation following T cell depleted autologous marrow transplantation provided evidence that residual T cells in infused T cell-depleted marrow play a central role in the generation of subsequent T cell populations. This possibility was confirmed in murine studies in which three T cell progenitor pools were identified which contribute to final T cell repopulation following marrow transplantation. It was found that CD4+ T cells arising from a peripheral, mature lymphocyte precursor pool were of memory phenotype, and that only CD4+ T cells generated by a thymic pathway contained large numbers of naive T cells. This information has been applied to studies of T cell generation in pediatric patients receiving chemotherapy which have shown an age dependence on generation of CD4+ T cells by the thymus and have validated this approach to study T cell generation in humans. In contrast to these studies in children, collaborative studies have shown that CD4+ T cell regeneration proceeds primarily by way of mature T cell expansion in adults. Parallel studies in this project have shown that such expansion is antigen (not cell cycle) driven, is prone to skewing, and is cytokine modulated. Two cytokines were identified as active in modifying CD4+ T cell reconstitution, namely Il-2 and IL-7. The former acted through upregulation of thymic dependent generation of T cells; the latter was the only cytokine identified which upregulated T cell regeneration by peripheral expansion of mature T cells in the absence of a functional thymus. These studies have also characterized CD8+ T cell generation in mice and humans. Unlike the case for CD4+ T cells, subsets of CD8+ T cells have been identified which appear to be generated directly from marrow precursors through extrathymic pathways. ',\n",
       " 'Nodal is a transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta like protein that we discovered on the basis of a retroviral insertional mutation and showed to be essential for early development, playing a major role in gastrulation. Our recent work on nodal signaling in mouse embryonic development has focused on the analysis of a targeted mutant allele with reduced function (a hypomorph). Embryos that are compound heterozygotes for this hypomorphic allele and a completely null allele are capable of developing past the block at gastrulation seen in homozygotes for the null allele, but then show a variety of developmental abnormalities. This has allowed us to establish a critical role for nodal in developmental processes occurring after gastrulation begins, including patterning of the anterior posterior and left right body axes, and the development of the midline mesendoderm and gut endoderm. However, because there is a generalized reduction of activity in each of the many domains of nodal expression our analysis did not provide insight into where nodal expression is required for these developmental events. To dissect these various temporal and spatial domains of nodal function further, we generated a conditional mutant (floxed) allele. Mice carrying this allele are being used in conjunction with transgenic strains expressing Cre recombinase in various regions of the developing embryo, which we have developed or obtained from other investigators. Preliminary analysis of embryos obtained from breeding floxed mice with a strain expressing Cre in the pregastrulation embryonic epiblast, the cells that will give rise to all the germ layers, has revealed all of the same phenotypes observed earlier for the hypomorphic allele. The possibility that expression in extraembryonic lineages may not be required for early nodal function is now being addressed by the use of a strain expressing Cre specifically in the extraembryonic visceral endoderm. Additional ongoing work is being performed with Cre strains with other tissue specificities.',\n",
       " 'A major goal of this project has been to quantify stages of the HIV-1 life cycle and understand how infection kinetics is affected by viral and cellular structures. We used a variety of biophysical, cellular and molecular biology techniques combined with mathematical modeling. We further developed our mathematical model of HIV-1 infection kinetics to describe quantitatively the appearance and spread of mutant virus, particularly in presence of selective pressure due to immune response or drug treatment. We used this model to analyze data for AIDS patients and monkey models of AIDS. The results indicated that combination therapy may successfully prevent emergence of drug resistant virus if the number of drugs acting at different target sites is larger than 3 and they completely block virus infection. We also measured the telomere length of blood cells from pediatric AIDS patients obtained over several years in order to find out whether telomere length can be used as a marker of HIV-1 pathogenesis. The results demonstrated that a slowly progressing patient showed no appreciable change in telomere length while two rapidly progressing patients showed a decrease in telomere length. This suggests that the increased leukocyte turnover associated with rapid disease progression may be reflected in an accelerated decline in telomere length. These preliminary results may indicate that telomere length could be used as a marker of the disease progression and eventually provide information for the turnover rate of lymphocytes in AIDS patients. We also studied the role of the HIV-1 coreceptors in entry. We have previously found that phorbol esters-induced downmodulation of tailless CD4 requires prior binding of gp120, suggesting a novel approach for identification of accessory fusion molecules. This year our collaborative effort lead to the isolation of a 45 kDa membrane-associated protein which we found is identical to fusin - the recently discovered T cell line tropic HIV-1 coreceptor. Our data provided the first direct evidence that fusin interacts with gp120 and CD4 forming a tri-molecular complex (n Science, in press). Based on these and other results we proposed a model of the interactions of fusin with CD4 and the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and also outlined possible approaches how to use this information for development of new drugs and vaccines. (Nature Medicine 2:640) These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms controlling the HIV-1 life-cycle and the development of AIDS, and for a rationale design of antiviral drugs.

       " 'Blood monocytes infiltrate into the sites of inflammation and play major roles in host defense. Although the mechanisms of monocyte infiltration have not been fully understood, locally produced monocyte chemoattractants appear to be responsible for the recruitment of blood monocytes into the sites of inflammatory reactions. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a member of the CC-subfamily of the chemokine family and attracts blood monocytes both in vitro and in vivo. MCP-1 mRNA or protein was detected at high level in the lesions of several diseases such as atherosclerosis, arthritis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and various tumors, strongly suggesting that MCP-1 plays a critical role in the recruitment of monocytes in these diseases and tumors. Although a wide variety of cells produce MCP-1 in vitro in response to various stimuli, infiltrating monocytes themselves are one of the major cell source of MCP-1 in vivo. The mechanisms of MCP-1 gene expression were previously studied in human malignant glioma cells and mouse fibroblasts. In human malignant glioma cells, the binding of Sp1 to the proximal GC box was critical for the basal level of human MCP-1 gene expression, whereas the binding of NF-kB dimers to one of NF-kB binding sites, A2 site, was critical for the enhancer activity after stimulation. The importance of the NF-kB binding to the distal region of the mouse MCP-1 gene was also reported by using mouse fibroblasts. This year, we investigated the mechanisms of the hMCP-1 gene transcription by using human monocytic cell line, THP-1 cells, and found that the binding of two NF-kB Rel protein dimers, (p65)2 and c-rel p65, to not only A2 site but also another NF-kB site (A1 site) was important for the transcription of this gene. Our findings will provide important information how the production of this molecule is regulated inside the cells. It has recently become evident that certain NF-kB Rel protein dimers such as (p65)2 or c-rel p65 specifically regulate the transcription of certain genes. Our findings clearly show that these NF- kB Rel protein dimers play an important role in the regulation of hMCP-1 gene transcription. ',\n",
       " \"Early 2D gel data analysis systems required a dedicated computer and systems people to install and run the special 2D gel software. We have been interested in extending the access of gel analysis software to a collaborative group setting so that all group members can work on the latest data wherever they are physically located. We recently started work on the WebGel system to allow exploratory access of GELLAB-II, GELLAB-II+ (CSPI Scanalytics) and other 2D and 1D gel databases to collaborators via the Internet. Users can access their data prepared at the workstation site and copied to their Web server through a Web browser. They can perform various data explorations including spot normalization and statistical comparison of corresponding spots across sets of gels. (For 1D gels, spots would be replaced by bands.) They can compare two gels at a time with Flicker to find significantly changing spots and then look up the corresponding quantitative data with WebGel. WebGel consists of an interdependent set of HTML, CGI-BIN, Java applets, and JavaScript programs (programming languages used to construct Web pages) to access parts of the legacy GELLAB-II quantitative data. The user sees a single Web interface and has transparent access to their own and their collaborators' views of the data.

       " \"Analysis of genetic effects on disease conferred by clusters of related and highly polymorphic genes poses substantial problems in terms of the identification of the true disease locus once an association has been observed. Understanding and accounting for the molecular genetic properties that operate over the locus is essential for accurate interpretation of both disease association data and analysis of functional interactions between the molecules encoded in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). Completion of the entire sequencing of the MHC has provided us with an invaluable tool for defining some of these properties. Comparing patterns of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) between pairs of markers with recombination fractions for the segment separating those pairs of loci can provide information regarding selective pressure to maintain linkage of specific combinations of alleles. Measurements of LD between pairs of HLA class I and II genes, particularly in the Centre d'Etude Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) families, have emerged over the past several years, revealing significant associations between loci separated by distances of >1 Mb. Previous studies of recombination using segregation analysis have suggested that overall, recombination across the MHC is lower than expected, although the use of family material for the generation of such information is severely limited in power. Detailed mapping of recombination using sperm typing has been performed within a 200 kb segment of the class II locus in the region of the genes DNA and DMB, showing a strong correlation between recombination fraction and LD values for pairs of markers over this short segment. In order to generate a reliable estimate of the frequency and distribution of recombination events across the entire MHC, we used single-sperm typing of microsatellite markers previously identified by us. Genotyping of 20,031 single sperm from 12 individuals resulted in the identification and fine mapping of 325 recombinant chromosomes. In this study, we found that recombination rate in hot spots may vary between individuals. For example, a region in HLA class III located between the BAT2 and LTA genes (45 kb), which was characterized as the strongest hot spot within the MHC, actually exhibited significant variation in recombination rate across individual sperm donors. We hypothesized that level of the sequence similarity between homologous chromosomes of a given individual in a particular chromosomal segment and rate of recombination would be correlated positively. Thus, we have begun to sequence this 45 kb fragment in 6 individuals whose recombination rates vary significantly in this area. The region is being amplified in 10 overlapping 5-6 kb segments and the Sanger Centre (Cambridge, UK) has agreed to make mini-libraries of each 5-6Kb amplicon and sequence multiple clones, creating contigs. Complete sequences of the 45 kb fragment will be assembled by our laboratory, and the level of sequence similarity will be analyzed in each individual to determine if there is a correlation with recombination rate. Through the International Histocompatibility Workshops, HLA allelic distributions across populations have been investigated. This organized transcontinental cooperation among HLA typing labs provides a unique and invaluable resource of HLA data that may not otherwise be available to the community. Historically, however, the data have suffered limitations in terms of typing resolution, consistency in typing protocols across laboratories, and numbers of samples typed for some populations. We have had the fortunate opportunity to genotype both the HLA class I and killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) loci in sets of samples (ranging in size from 23-129 individuals) from 29 worldwide populations. KIR and HLA typing have been completed on the majority of the 1612 samples sent to us and we will soon begin the process of analyzing the data. We have also received 320 DNA samples representing distinct tribes from rural southern Cameroon that will be included in our population analysis of these genes. Consideration of these data in terms of the geographic origins of the various populations may provide clues to potential selection processes that have occurred differentially across the populations. \",\n",
       " 'As part of a project to develop a genetic and physical map of the domestic cat major histocompatibility complex (MHC), we have constructed a domestic cat genomic DNA library in pCYPAC3.0 (Ioannou et al., Nature Genetics 6: 84, 1994) composed of 91,900 independent P1 artificial chromosomes (PACs). To determine average insert size of the feline PAC library, 35 clones were digested with Not I, which cleaves the vector at sites flanking the Bam HI cloning site and analyzes the digestion products by pulse field gel electrophoresis. The average insert size was 80,000 base pairs with a size range of 50-150 kilobases (kb). The theoretical number of genome-equivalents represented was estimated at 2.5 and the probability of finding any given gene sequence as 91%. To estimate a realistic coverage, we screened the library with 52 comparative anchor tagged sequences (CATS) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Lyons et al., Nature Genetics 15: 47, 1997) and compared the PCR products obtained from the PAC library with cat genomic DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis. The results indicated that 43 of the 52 CATS were represented in the cat genomic PAC library and, therefore, the actual probability of finding any given gene is 83%. To determine if the cat genomic PAC library would be useful for the cloning of cat genes, the library was screened with a feline MHC class I cDNA, feline MHC class II cDNAs for DRA and DRB, and a feline DPA pseudogene. A total of ten positive colonies with an average insert size of 79.9 kb were isolated, six PACs containing class I sequences, three containing DRA sequences (one of which also contained DRB sequences), and one containing DPA sequences. Restriction enzyme analysis and fingerprinting of the class I PAC clones using a nonradioactive method that gives uniform band intensities (Ota and Amemiya, Genetic Analysis 12: 173, 1996) indicates that the six class I PAC clones represent four separate contigs. For MHC class II PAC clones, fingerprinting and hybridization analyses indicated that the three DR positive clones represent two individual contigs, suggesting that two distinct DR haplotypes are represented. Sample sequencing of PAC clone ends and of random Bam HI subclones is currently underway to confirm overlapping clones, identify microsatellite markers, and determine gene and microsatellite order. This library should also prove useful for comparative mapping projects, analysis of historic recombination events, and positional cloning of disease genes in the domestic cat. ',\n",
       " \"The HIV-1 virus uses two primary coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, in addition to CD4 to infect cells. CCR5 is the primary receptor for the transmissible, macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) variants while CXCR4 is used by the synctium-inducing (SI) variants capable of infecting T-cell lines (T- tropic). T-tropic variants emerge during the asymptomatic period of infection and are associated with more rapid disease progression and loss of CD4 T cells. The ligand for CXCR4, stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) has been shown to cause internalization of CXCR4, making the receptor unavailable for binding by HIV-1 variants using CXCR4 for cell entry and infection. Several studies have shown that SDF-1 is a powerful antiviral agent and blocks fusion by T- tropic SI variants. Because of the obvious role of chemokine receptors and their ligands in HIV pathogenesis, we have screened for polymorphisms in the genes encoding both receptors and ligands using a panel of patients that are high risk, uninfected, rapid progressors to AIDS in less than 5 years, or long time survivors (no AIDS for more than 12 years). We have identified a mutation in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of SDF-1beta cDNA that when homozygous, is highly protective against progression to AIDS and death in the first 10 years following infection. This SDF-1 variant may prevent the emergence of the more pathogenic T-tropic SI strains that use CXCR4 as a coreceptor, thus delaying the onset of immunodeficiency and AIDS. Possible mechanisms for the function of the 3' UTR mutation are under investigation. \",\n",
       " 'Development of genomic resources in the domestic cat is key to application of this species as a model for heritable and infectious diseases, and for comparative genome analysis. Previous versions of the cat gene map, based on somatic cell hybrid analysis, revealed considerable conservation of synteny with the human genome. However, these maps provided no knowledge of gene order and genome rearrangement between the two species, information that is critical to applying the comparative candidate approach to positional cloning in gene-poor model systems. Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping has emerged as the most powerful tool for constructing moderate- to high-density gene maps in vertebrates by obviating the need to identify interspecific polymorphisms. A domestic cat RH panel has been developed and serves as the backbone for feline gene mapping, while also serving to cross-reference microsatellite positions on the domestic cat linkage map. We are in the process of completing a fourth generation RH map of the cat, which nearly doubles our past cover of the cat genome. A fourth generation map has recently been completed; it includes 1793 markers, integrating 662 coding loci, 335 targeted markers derived from the cat 2X whole genome sequence, and 797 microsatellite loci. The strategy used in developing the current RH map was to target gaps in the feline-human comparative map, and to provide more definition in break points in regions of conserved synteny between cat and human. The 1793 markers cover the length of the 19 feline autosomes and the X chromosome at an average spacing of one marker every 1.5 Mb (Megabase), with fairly uniform marker density. The enhanced comparative map provides 86% and 85% comparative coverage of the human and canine genomes, respectively. Ninety-six percent of the 1793 cat markers have identifiable orthologues in the canine and human genome sequences, providing a rich comparative tool, which is critical in linkage mapping exercises for the identification of genes controlling feline phenotypes. Alignment of cat, dog and human chromosomes demonstrate different patterns of chromosomal rearrangement with a marked increase in interchromosomal rearrangements relative to humans in the canid lineage (89% of all rearrangements), as opposed to the more frequent intrachromosomal rearrangements in the felid lineage (95% of all rearrangements) since divergence from a common carnivoran ancestor 55 million years (MY) ago. With an average spacing of 1 marker every 1.5 Mb in the feline euchromatic sequence, the map provides a solid framework for the chromosomal assignment of feline contigs and scaffolds during assembly of the cat genome assembly and as a comparative tool to aid in the identification of genes controlling feline phenotypes. Most notable discovery: development of 4th generation map which demonstrated different patterns of chromosomal rearrangement with a marked increase in interchromosomal rearrangements relative to humans in the canid lineage (89% of all rearrangements), as opposed to the more frequent intrachromosomal rearrangements in the felid lineage (95% of all rearrangements) since divergence from a common carnivoran ancestor.No patents, clinical trials, grants, major appointments, or scientific awards.',\n",
       " 'The CCR5 gene encodes a molecule which serves as a secondary receptor on macrophages and CD4+ T cells for certain strains of HIV-1. We and others have previously identified a mutant of CCR5 characterized by a 32 base pair deletion, which protects from infection in homozygotes and prolongs time to AIDS in infected heterozygotes. We have continued to type cohorts for this mutation with a total number of 672 HIV- and 1,935 HIV+ individuals. While the genotype frequencies of homozygous wild- type, as well as the heterozygous wild-type deletion, is equivalent in the HIV-1- and HIV-1+ samples, homozygotes for CCR5delta32 are significantly more frequent in HIV-1- than HIV-1+ individuals (p=0.00000000007). We have also identified 16 additional variants in the coding region of the CCR5 gene, all 3 of which are codon coding altering. The high predominance of codon- altering alleles among CCR5 mutants is consistent with an adaptive accumulation of function-altering alleles for this gene, perhaps as a consequence of historic selective pressures. We have identified two HIV-1+ individuals who are homozygous for the CCR5delta32 mutation, providing evidence that although homozygosity for this mutation provides strong resistance to HIV-1 infection, it does not afford complete protection. Preliminary analysis has suggested that these individuals became infected with HIV-1 isolates which use the CXCR4 molecule, rather than CCR5, as a coreceptor for infection. A genotype survey of 4,008 individuals revealed a cline in the CCR5delta32 frequencies from north to south in Europe. The variant was missing in native Africans, native Americans, and East Asian ethnic groups. The data indicate that the mutation occurred once in an ancestral Caucasian population. ',\n",
       " 'Analysis of whole genomes for mapping by admixture linkage disequilibium (MALD) and candidate genes requires an appropriate set of markers and the ability to accurately genotype hundreds of markers with hundreds of patients. Markers appropriate for MALD must have large differences between racial groups. While our first applications of MALD are in African Americans, we expect that other admixed groups like Hispanics will also be explored by ourselves and other groups. To that end, we initially genotyped 254 microsatellite markers in Asians, Hispanics, African Americans and Caucasians with sample sizes of approximately 22 for each group. These analyses identified 154 with sufficiently large differences between markers for use in analyses of African American patients. In FY 1997, we designed primers and multiplex analyses for an additional 220 markers to fill gaps in the 10-centiMorgan MALD microsatellite map of the human genome. Analyses of this second set of markers is ongoing with about 130 of them generating clean enough products in our first pass screening of approximately 45 individuals of Asian, Hispanic, African American and Caucasian descent. Determination of approximately 50,000 microsatellite genotypes for these MALD marker projects alone prompted us to search for more efficient and accurate genotyping strategies. The first efforts screening microsatellite markers were handled essentially eight or twelve tubes at a time. Our research and development efforts now allow laboratory assays to be performed in 96-well microtiter plates for high-throughput genotyping. Currently DNA samples are pre-aliquotted into 96-well plates with a pre- polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Hydra pipettor that pipettes all of the samples at once, dried down and stored for later analyses. A panel of 37 plates of HIV-1-infected and -exposed individuals were developed for genotyping. PCR cocktails for a locus are later added with 12-channel pipettors. Subsequent microsatellite pooling for multiple analyses is performed with a post-PCR Hydra pipettor, and other genotyping assays (e.g., PCR- restriction fragment length polymorphisms, single strand conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis) are handled with multichannel pipettors. Previously setting up 500 PCR reactions took an hour or two. With these developments it is possible to set up 2000-3000 reactions in the same time. The reduced sample handling has resulted in fewer missing data points that were the result of pipetting errors made in the complex set-up of reactions. Throughput will be further increased, particularly for microsatellites where only a small fraction of the PCR sample is analyzed, by an investment in 384-well technology that is currently coming to market. The adoption of 96-well matrix-based microtiter plate technology has allowed us address genetic questions that previously seemed virtually insurmountable. ',\n",
       " \"Given previous reports of the role of IL10 variants in both HCV therapy and clearance we sought to evaluate the role of genetic variants at this gene and its neighbors. We examined a total of 274 African Americans (91 clearance cases and 183 chronically infected matched controls) and 353 European Americans (108 clearance and 245 chronic). There were seven alleles and eight different genotypes in the IL10 and IL19 IL20 genes that had significant associations with HCV clearance, essentially only in African Americans (p=0.05-0.002). Also, as expected, African Americans had more common haplotypes, one in IL10 and two in the IL19 IL20 region some of which indicated associations with HCV (p=0.05-0.001). Most of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have not been associated with HCV outcome in the past, which opens new avenues for candidate gene testing for this disease. In addition, we confirmed the involvement of IL10 distal promoter haplotypes associated with the level of production and HCV clearance. Therefore, results of this study could have implications for the identification of HCV clearance mechanisms as well as therapy decisions. The paper about our findings of SNPs and haplotypes in the IL10 region associated with HCV clearance has been published in Genes and Immunity. Similar approach was taken for HBV. In our analysis, 42 SNPs in IL10, IL19, IL20, FNBP2, IKBKE, RASSF5, LGTN, DYRK3, MARKAPK2, TOSO, PIGR, FKSG87 and SARG in 105 African Americans (36 chronically infected cases, 69 matched clearance controls), and 248 European Americans (97 chronically infected cases, 151 matched clearance controls) were examined for an association with HBV infection outcome, either chronic or recovered. Three SNP variants in IL10, two SNP variants in IL20, and one IL20 haplotype were significantly associated with different HBV disease outcomes in African Americans (P = .005-.04). One of the SNPs in IL20 deviated significantly from the Hardy-Weinberg expectations in African Americans with a large excess of heterozygotes in chronic HBV-infected cases (P = .0006), which suggests a strong genetic effect. Among European Americans, two SNP variants in IL20, as well as one IL20 haplotype were significantly associated with HBV recovery (P = .01-.04). The paper about our findings of SNPs and haplotypes in the IL10 region associated with HBV clearance is being prepared for submission to Hepatology. Several polymorphisms located close to or within the IL10 gene are associated with different transcription levels and the nearby flanking genes are being examined for their potential impact on disease. The importance of the IL10-5'A polymorphism has been identified by pursuing an approach of examining over 170 candidate genes in patient cohorts to test hypotheses of susceptibility to HIV-1 and progression to AIDS. Individuals with the IL10-5'A polymorphism who have a lower level of IL10 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells upon stimulation progress to AIDS after about five years of infection, faster than individuals without the promoter variant. Other polymorphisms around and within the IL10 gene have been examined in the laboratory to test the degree of linkage disequilibrium around this gene and the possibility that they may be involved in disease progression. Haplotypes encompassing the IL10 gene and its paralogs are currently being statistically analyzed for their potential impact on HIV susceptibility and AIDS progression. Haplotypes carrying the classic promotor ATA polymorphism is related to rapid progression to AIDS compared to any other haplotypes, whereas ACC haplotypes tend to be associates with relatively slower progression, while GCC haplotypes seem to have little or no effect. We did not find any haplotype associations with HIV progression to AIDS among the African Americans and report only the results among the European Americans.\",\n",
       " 'As anticipated in last years annual report the MPR web site http: mpr.nci.nih.gov has undergone a major multi-component improvement in infrastructure this year. The most fundamental change is from the Microsoft .NET framework to Ruby on Rails (ROR). The rationale was that the proprietary.NET architecture has not evolved to be nearly as efficient in implementation or alteration as was widely anticipated. In contrast, ROR is a very powerful, open-source framework for developing database-backed web applications. The emerging evidence indicated to us that ROR was on a trajectory similar to that of Linux in its early days, and was becoming the framework of choice for database driven web applications like MPR. This rewrite provided the opportunity to incorporate enhancements. For example: 1) in MPR.ROR literature citations are displayed in each context where a phosphorylation site is shown, rather than in a few selected contexts in MRP.NET; 2) An enhanced search for molecules is incorporated; and 3) Internal data retrieval is based on simpler, more robust query strategies. In concert with the rewrite, hosting has been moved entirely to NCI Servers to assure reliability. A big part of this effort was working with staff (employees and contractors) of NCIWeb to introduce this new technology to NCIWeb. While there was a wealth of documentation for Ruby on Rails deployment, very little pertained to NCIWEB configurations. Thus, significant adaptations were required. In addition, systems security has been markedly improved, facilitated by security scans and technology in place on the NCI servers. The new MPR.ROR is being deployed in early October 2008. Concurrent with these changes, content has been culled of antibodies withdrawn from the market, and augmented by new antibodies from 7 companies.

       " 'An important question in biology is what makes cells die. We are studying the degeneration and premature cell death of terminally differentiated photoreceptor neurons (PRNs) in the adult retina. In flies and humans, many point mutations in the photoreceptor protein rhodopsin dominantly trigger PRN apoptosis and loss of vision. In humans, the disease is called retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The phenotype in Drosophila is remarkably similar to that in humans. Among other things, not only do PRNs expressing the mutant opsins die, but also PRNs that express different opsins. The mechanism is thus at least partly non-cell-autonomous. Our goal is to determine the mechanism of neuronal cell death and degeneration. Projects: Current research and future plans are focused on three major questions:1. The relationship between neurodegeneration and apoptosisQuantitation of neurodegeneration in vivo has historically been challenging. Yet it is essential for genetic modifier studies (see below). We have taken advantage of unique attributes of the fly compound eye to quantitate degeneration in vivo. But in the process of validating the assay, we discovered early, pre-apoptotic stages of degeneration whose relationship to classic apoptosis is unclear. We are particularly interested in the activation of cell death, so this is fortuitious. However, these degenerated morphologies often persist for weeks before apoptotic morphologies appear, whereas classic apoptosis takes only hours from start to finish. Amazingly, lowered dosages of proapoptotic genes such as hid suppress even these early changes. This raises the question of whether neurodegeneration in RP is a slowed-down form of apoptosis, or a separate process coincidentally controlled by hid and followed by apoptosis. Having determined specific methods of detection of these stages, we are engaged in identifying the genes involved using microarray, molecular biological and genetic approaches. 2. The trigger for degeneration provided by the dominant rhodopsin mutationsIn cases where RP mutations cause opsin misfolding, the leading theory has been that apoptosis is triggered by overstimulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), constituting a toxic-gain-of-function mechanism. However, our research now shows that the mutant proteins are in fact partial loss-of-function mutants. This implies that wild type rhodopsin actually plays a role in PRN maintenance and survival, not just visual signaling. While the UPR undoubtedly occurs, the evidence does not support an essential role for it in cell killing. The mechanism we propose unifies all the previously reported data on PRN homeostasis, including studies of the effects of photoactivation in other phototransduction -signaling-mutant backgrounds, and the requirement for rhodopsin in PRN development. Most significantly, the mechanism makes us shift focus from \"How do mutant opsins kill PRNs\" to \"How does wild type opsin promote PRN maintenance and survival\" Given the evolutionary conservation of heterotrimeric G protein signaling, we anticipate that our results will be relevant to the control of apoptosis in a variety of cells.3. The genetic pathway of degeneration and cell death activated by rhodopsin mutations.By genetic deficiency screening, we have identified suppressor and enhancer loci affecting opsin mutant induced degeneration. Identification of the responsible genes is a future focus. In addition, candidate gene screening indicates both similarities and dissimilarities in how cell death is controlled in adult PRNs vs. developing PRNs and mitotic cells. These factors include light, cell-death-regulatory genes such as hid, TRAF, caspases and dIAP1, and the ras mitogen-activated kinase pathway genes. However, the activating or suppressing activities of these genes are sometimes opposite to those in mitotic cells, indicating different or additional control mechanisms in the adult, terminally differentiated neurons.',\n",
       " 'In the last several years, our group has studied the folding behavior of small single domain proteins, including cyt c, Rd-apocyt b562, barnase, PDZ domain, and FAT domain. We found that these proteins fold through partially unfolded intermediates that exist after the rate-limiting step. We called them \"hidden intermediates\" since they can not be detected in conventional kinetic experiments. Further, we have developed a native-state hydrogen exchange-directed protein engineering method for populating the intermediates and determined the first high-resolution structures of the intermediates by multi-dimensional NMR methods. Recently, we have extended our studies to include multi-domain proteins such as T4 lysozyme, ribonuclease H, and a redesigned protein by coupling protein A B-domain with Rd-apocyt b562. The results obtained from these studies provide strong support for the hypothesis that the kinetic principle of protein folding is the step-wise folding of cooperative structure units (foldons) (see pictures in the Gallery). We also provided theoretical arguments on why proteins should fold in a step-wise manner and why the current funnel-like energy landscape view is inadequate to describe the folding behavior of proteins, i.e., desolvation during folding leads to energy barrier on the energy landscape, random search, and co-opertive formation of partially unfolded intermediates.',\n",
       " 'A recent development in the field of E. coli DNA replication is the identification of weak (incognito) binding sites for the initiator DnaA in the origin of replication, called I-sites. These sites play a key role in timing of replication initiation in the cell cycle. Because of the difficulty of recognizing I-sites, the generality of their occurrence has remained obscure. Richard Fekete and Tatiana Venkova-Canova have succeeded in localizing sequences with characteristics of an I-site in a second system (in the replication origin of plasmid P1). The sequence information should help to define an I-site better and thus help identification of such sites in other systems and study their roles in replication control. Bacteria capable of rapid proliferation such as E. coli and B. subtilis usually amplify the origin proximal region of their chromosome. In V. cholerae, Preeti Srivastava found this to be true for chromosome I but not II. The growth-rate insensitive behavior of the latter turned out to be due to homeostatic controls on its initiator RctB. Relaxing the control increased the copy number of chromosome II but decreased the cell growth rate, suggesting that this chromosome might serve as a repository for potentially deleterious genes. These genes thus could play a role in maintaining relative copy number of the two chromosomes. Ryosuke Kadoya is standardizing conditions to selectively inhibit replication initiation of one of the two Vibrio chromosomes and study the consequences to replication and segregation of the other chromosome, as well as to cell growth and division. These studies are expected to provide initial evidence for communication between the two chromosomes and whether mechanisms exist in bacteria analogous to check-point controls prevalent in eukaryotes. To study the regulation of replication of chromosome II, Tatiana Venkova-Canova has defined the bounds of the replication origin and adjoining sequences that serve to control replication initiation negatively. The origin resembles those of some plasmids but the negative control locus is more extended and complex compared to the plasmids. A novel mechanism was found that controls the level of chromosome II specific initiator, RctB, homeostatically, and thereby the replication initiation frequency. Unlike in E. coli, where DNA adenine methylase (Dam) plays a facilitatory role in DNA replication, the enzyme appears essential for replication of both the chromosomes of V. cholerae. The exact role of Dam in replication is not known but most likely it alters the structure of origin DNA that eases its melting, a crucial step in replication initiation. Dam can also modulate gene expression by methylating promoter DNA, and could play an indirect role by supplying a gene product crucial for replication initiation. Gaelle Demarre is testing these alternate possibilities on how Dam could be playing its obligatory role in V. cholerae. The equivalent of microtubules of the eukaryotic mitotic apparatus has not been found in bacteria, and how the bacterial chromosomes segregate has remained largely enigmatic. The recent discovery in bacteria of an actin homolog, MreB, is of special interest because of its suggested role in chromosome segregation. Preeti Srivastava found that the properties of V. cholerae MreB to be similar to its homolog in other bacteria, and that alteration of the protein led to gross distortion in nucleoid morphology and localization of centromeric regions for both the chromosomes. In V. cholerae, Ranajit Ghosh has identified the centromere for chromosome I. A couple of centromere-associated proteins (ParA and ParB) have been purified. To understand how the centromere is utilized to segregate and retain the sister chromosomes in opposite cell halves, Ranajit Ghosh is trying to identify proteins that may serve as mitotic motors or chromosomal anchors. He has been able to co-immuno-precipitate several proteins from crude cell extracts using antibodies against ParAB proteins. The proteins are being identified using LCMS MS.',\n",
       " 'Over the last year we have used advanced methods in cryo-electron tomography to image two types of intact bacterial cells that display novel modes of motility. Cells of Flavobacterium johnsoniae, and of many other members of the phylum Bacteroidetes, move rapidly over surfaces in a process known as gliding motility. F. johnsoniae cells typically move at speeds of 2 to 5 m s over glass surfaces. They also adsorb added latex spheres and propel these around the cell in multiple path. Numerous behavioral, biochemical, electron microscopic and genetic analyses of F. johnsoniae have been conducted to understand gliding but the structures that comprise the motility machinery and the mechanism of cell movement are not known. Using cryo-electron tomography, we showed that wild-type cells display tufts of 4 nm-wide cell surface filaments that appear to be anchored to the inner surface of the outer membrane. These filaments are absent in cells of a nonmotile gldF mutant, but are restored upon expression of plasmid-encoded GldF, a component of a putative ATP-binding-cassette transporter. In related studies on the predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, we demonstrated that B. bacteriovorus cells are capable of substantial flexibility and local deformations of their outer and inner membranes without loss of cell integrity. These shape changes can occur in less than 2 minutes, and analysis of the internal architecture of highly bent cells shows that the overall distribution of molecular machines and the nucleoid is similar to those seen in moderately bent cells. B. bacteriovorus cells appear to contain an extensive internal network of short and long filamentous structures. We have suggested that rearrangements of these structures, in combination with the unique properties of the cell envelope may underlie the remarkable ability of B. bacteriovorus cells to find and enter bacterial prey. (see Liu et al (2007) and Borgnia et al (2008) for more details). We have also used electron tomography to analyze structures of nanoparticles such as the icosahedral pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme complex and the cancer drug Doxil. We have shown that electron tomography can be a powerful method for providing quality control on the physical characteristics of complex nanomedicine formulations such as Doxil. We have also shown that individual PDH complexes can be imaged and interpreted in terms of the atomic structures of the E1, E2 and E3 components, further establishing an important role for tomography as a structural tool in nanomedicine. (see Lengyel, Milne et al (2008) and Lengyel, Stott et al (2008) for more details). Over the last year, we have used ion abrasion scanning electron microscopy to show that MNT-1 melanoma cells can be rapidly imaged at resolutions of 30-nm in the z-direction (direction of section removal), and 6 nm in the x-y plane (plane of section removal). We also showed that individual gold and quantum dot particles can be localized in the images, demonstrating that ion-abrasion scanning electron microscopy is a powerful method for obtaining combined information on 3D ultrastructure and molecular localization. In particular, statistical analysis of information obtained from the imaging such as size, shape and compositional analysis of organelles could provide valuable diagnostic markers for discriminating normal cells from abnormal cells. Yet another aspect of these studies concerns applications for clinical and pre-clinical imaging of tissue specimens. Nanoparticles such as gold and iron oxide-based compounds that have electron dense features are especially amenable to detection as imaging agents. We are using ion-abrasion scanning electron microscopy to provide rapid feedback on subcellular localization of these nanoparticles in an effort that could be highly relevant in clinical contexts to determine useful doses, efficiency of tissue targeting, and efficacy of drug delivery to the correct targets. Knowledge of drug distribution could also lead to ideas for chemical modifications that could improve delivery of these nanoscale reagents.',\n",
       " 'The goal of this project is to understand the mechanism by which the progesterone receptor (PR) interacts with and remodels chromatin at target genes in vivo using the promoters for the FKBP51 gene and the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) as model systems. In the non-activated state, the MMTV promoter has a chromatin structure repressive to transcription when it exists in cells as replicating chromatin. Upon binding of the liganded glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the promoter undergoes a chromatin remodeling event which is mechanistically involved in the activation of transcription. Our previous work has shown that the GR and PR have different requirements for chromatin remodeling at the MMTV promoter even though they bind to the same DNA sequences in the promoter. Our observations may form the basis for a mechanism by which the GR and PR control expression of distinct sets of target genes in vivo. This is particularly relevant in the mammary gland where the GR and PR may coexist in the same cell types. We have established that the PR exists in two distinct functional states in cultured mammary adenocarcinoma cells. In one state, it can neither remodel chromatin nor activate transcription at the MMTV promoter; thus its action may be restricted to target genes which do not require remodeling prior to activation. In addition, this form of the PR can be activated by other signal transduction pathways in a progestin-independent fashion. In the second functional state, the PR is able to remodel and activate the MMTV promoter in chromatin, but is refractory to ligand-independent activation. Thus, this form of the PR responds only to its ligand but would be able to activate target genes even in a repressive chromatin environment. We have also shown that the PR can be converted from the first state to the second by some form of cellular processing. This may represent a mechanism by which cells can restrict or expand the activity of the PR in vivo. Because molecular chaperones play a critical role in the processing of steroid receptors, we have examined the association of the PR with chaperones in the two functional states. We found that the unliganded PR forms a variety of complexes which are differentially distributed in its two functional states. PR which cannot remodel chromatin but is activated by ligand-independent mechanisms is enriched in a tightly-bound nuclear form which appears to be either dimerized and chaperone-free or complexed with hsp90, p23, and the large immunophilin, FKBP51. In contrast, PR which can activate MMTV in chromatin and is refractory to ligand-independent activation exists mostly in a cytosolic or loosely-bound nuclear form complexed with hsp90 and p23. We speculate that the balance between the cytoplasmic and tightly-bound nuclear state indicates that PR chaperone interactions can be regulated by means other than the presence of progestins. In addition, the balance of these interactions may have a significant impact on the function of the PR. Current efforts are concentrated on the molecular basis of PR distribution between nuclear and cytosolic states. I The classic model of steroid receptor action is that the ligand-occupied receptor binds directly to recognition sequences in the promoter of a target gene. However, upon characterization of an increasing number of steroid-regulated genes, it is becoming clear that there are other mechanisms of steroid receptor-induced activation that may not involve a direct interaction with DNA. The promoter for the large immunophilin, FKBP51, is upregulated by progestins and glucocorticoids. However, the promoter has no classic steroid response elements, rather, evidence indicates that this regulation may be mediated through Sp1 sites by an unknown mechanism. A number of other steroid-regulated promoters are also rich in Sp1 sites. We have initiated a project to characterize the mechanism by which PR activates this promoter in chromatin, comparing it directly with the mechanism by which PR activates the MMTV promoter in the same cells',\n",
       " 'The major focus of this project is to understand how cells monitor and repair DNA damage. Defects in either the surveillance or repair of damaged DNA can lead to chromosomal instability and cancer. For example, inherited disorders affecting cellular responses to DNA damage, such as Nijmegen breakage syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia are characterized by increased susceptibility to lymphoid cancer, extreme radiation sensitivity and immunodeficiency. We are generating knockout and transgenic mouse models that have specific defects in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. Recently, we characterized mice that were defective in non-homologous end joining, the major pathway for repairing DSBs in mammalian cells. We found that these mice displayed premature aging, a defect in cellular proliferation, a complete block in lymphocyte development and extreme radiation sensitivity. Surprisingly, however, the mice were not prone to cancer. However, a further inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene markedly increased cancer susceptibility, such that these \"double knockout\" mice invariably succumbed to B-cell lymphomas that resembled human Burkitt\\'s lymphoma. Other mouse models for DNA double strand break repair are being generating including animals that lack the Nijmegen breakage sydrome protein.',\n",
       " 'In multistage carcinogenesis of the mouse epidermis, premalignant progression is characterized by increasing genomic instability such as trisomy of chromosome 6 and 7, aneuploidy, loss of heterozygosity and amplification of activated c-ras alleles. Our earlier studies have shown that a critical determinant of the altered genomic stability and premalignant progression in this model is transforming growth factorb1 (TGFb1). Loss of TGFb1 expression is an early in vivo event which distinguishes benign squamous papillomas that are precursor lesions to squamous cell carcinomas from benign papillomas that undergo limited progression. To understand how loss of TGFb signaling accelerates v-ras initiated carcinogenesis we have examined the in vitro effects of v-ras on keratinocytes that are defective in TGFb signaling due to a targeted null mutation for TGFb1, null mutation for Smad3 or that overexpress Smad7 through retroviral or adenoviral transduction. Following transduction with v-ras, wildtype keratinocytes undergo limited hyperproliferation followed by a growth arrest and senescence. However, keratinocytes that are null for TGF-b or Smad3 or overexpress Smad7 have a reduced senescence phenotype and rapidly become immortal. Skin grafts of Smad3 null v-ras and Smad7 v-ras keratinocytes form squamous cell carcinomas while control genotypes remain benign papillomas. The block to the v-ras associated growth arrest is correlated with an inability to upregulate the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p15ink4b and p16ink4a. Analysis of keratinocytes infected with Smad expressing adenoviruses and Smad 3 null keratinocytes points to an important role for Smad 3 but not Smad 2 or Smad 4 in senescence and the induction of p15 and p16. In addition Smad independent pathways for induction of p16 by TGF-b have been uncovered. These results provide a new mechanistic framework for understanding the actions of TGFb as a tumor suppressor in human cancer.',\n",
       " 'TGFb has both tumor suppressive and oncogenic activites in cancer development that may reflect stage specific responses of the tumor cells to this cytokine. In order to assess the effects of TGFb at different stages of premalignant progression in vivo, we have generated transgenic mice in which the tetracycline regulatable transactivators tTA and rtTA are targeted to the epidermis with a keratin 5 promoter. These mice have been crossed with a transgenic line containing a tetO regulated constitutively active TGFb. The expression of TGFb can be controlled in the double transgenic mice with doxycycline, and we have demonstrated reversible neonatal lethality and adult alopecia when TGFb is expressed during development or in the adult skin (Liu, et al., PNAS 93:9139-9144, 2001). To identify TGFb targets that might differ between benign and malignant epidermal tumors, we have generated tumors using a DMBA-TPA chemical carcinogenesis protocol. In double transgenic mice bearing either papillomas or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) we have induced expression of the tetOTGFb construct with doxycycline. RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from whole skin showed that within 24 hrs of addition of doxycycline, TGFb1 transgene mRNA was induced to near maximal levels. Expression of TGFb1 in double transgenic papillomas caused a rapid reduction in cell proliferation, and regression within 1 week accompanied by a lymphocytic infiltrate. Induction of TGFb1 in bitransgenic squamous cell carcinoma did not reduce cell proliferation compared to single transgenic SCC. To identify stage specific transcriptional targets of TGFb1 we used cDNA microarrays to compare the pattern of gene expression in double transgenic papillomas and carcinomas 48 hrs after doxycycline addition with single transgenic papillomas and carcinomas, respectively. The filtered data was compared using a Two Group Wilcoxon Rank-Sum analysis to identify genes that were differentially regulated by TGFb1 between the papillomas and carcinomas. Of 117 genes identified with a p value<.02, 63% were upregulated in papillomas but downregulated in carcinomas. A significant fraction of the genes suppressed in the SCC expressing TGFb 1 were those regulated by, or important in the interferon signaling pathway such as Stat1, IRF-1, IRF-6, Ifi204, and H2 locus. We are currently verifying the array results in the tumor tissues and determining the significance of the downregulation of the interferon pathway by TGFb1 for tumor progression.',\n",
       " 'Using the Drosophila system, our research goal is to understand cell biology events elicited by cancer-causing genes. My group is focusing on the following two projects: (1) the JAK STAT signal transduction pathway in Drosophila development and tumor formation; and (2) the epithelial cell sheet movement during Drosophila embryonic dorsal closure. I. The Drosophila JAK STAT signal transduction pathwayThe JAK STAT cascade has emerged as an essential reutilized facet of vertebrate signaling through a large number of cytokines and growth factors. Both decreases and increases in activity of this signaling pathway have severe consequences. Constitutive activation of JAKs and or STATs is correlated with several oncogenic transformations. In 1996, as a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Norbert Perrimon\\'s laboratory, I isolated the Drosophila STAT mutation (Hou et al., 1996). Overexpression of upd (pGMR-upd), the ligand of the Drosophila JAK STAT signal transduction pathway, in the fly eye resulted in large deformed eyes. In a genetic screen for suppressors of the abnormal eye phenotype, we identified a receptor (named master of marelle or mom) of the JAK STAT signal transduction pathway (Chen et al., 2002).In our recent GLC screen, we took advantage of the available complete Drosophila genomic sequence. We first performed a P element-mediated gene disruption screen. By examining over 50,000 mutant lines, we isolated 2,500 single P-insertion lethal mutants. Sequences flanking >2300 insertions were determined that identify 850 different genes or ESTs (Oh et al., 2002).We then performed GLC assays for 600 selected genes whose mutations had not been studied prior to our P-element screen. From the GLC screen, several new genes, \"hop-like\" genes, have been identified that appear to be part of the JAK STAT pathway. The Drosophila cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) is among these new genes. We demonstrated that Cyclin D-Cdk4 (and also Cyclin E-Cdk2) binds and regulates STAT92E protein stability (Chen et al., 2003). We further showed that the JAK STAT signaling and CycD-Cdk4 signaling synergistically regulate melanotic tumor formation. In the eye, the CycD-Cdk4 signaling prevents cell differentiation and the JAK STAT signaling promotes cell proliferation; collaboration between these two signals leads to the eye\\'s \"tumor-like\" outgrowth. We have cloned two SOCS genes from Drosophila, socs44A and socs60E. Our results suggest that SOCS60E specifically down-regulates the JAK STAT signaling and SOCS44A mostly regulates other signalings. II. The epithelial cell sheet movement during Drosophila embryonic dorsal closureIn many epithelial-derived cancers, signals will eventually cause cell polarity changes and breakdown of cell junctions, which are the initial steps of tumor metastasis. Drosophila embryonic dorsal closure (DC) mimics these events and provides an excellent system to understand the molecular mechanisms of these processes. DC is also being used as a model system to study wound healing. In DC, actin dynamics at the leading edge are preceded by a polarization of the dorsal-most epidermal cells associated with a reorganization of the cytoskeleton. In 1997, we discovered the Drosophila homologue of the mammalian proto-oncogene c-Jun gene (Djun) as a central regulator of the DC process (Hou et al., 1997).We recently characterized another gene that regulates the DC process, connector of kinase to AP-1 (cka). cka encodes a protein containing several protein-protein interaction domains. CKA forms a complex with HEP (DJNKK), BSK (DJNK), DJUN, and DFOS. The complex activates BSK kinase, which phosphorylates and activates DJUN and DFOS. CKA represents a novel molecule regulating AP-1 activity by organizing a molecular complex of kinases and transcription factors (Chen et al., 2002).',\n",
       " \"Inbred SENCARA Pt mice are very susceptible to the induction of both benign and malignant skin tumors by standard initiation-promotion protocols. Crosses between SENCARA Pt and resistant BALB cAnPt mice revealed that resistance to papilloma induction is incompletely dominant, and that multiple genes determine susceptibility. A genome scan led to the identification of a major locus controlling susceptibility on chromosome 5 in a 21 cM interval between D5Mit259 and D5Mit369, and modifier loci on chromosomes 9, 11 and 12. A comparison of the susceptibility of F1 progeny produced by either SENCARA Pt or BALB cAnPt females showed that the mice were uniformly resistant to skin tumor induction. However, the susceptibility phenotype of backcross mice that resulted from the cross of F1 females to SENCARA Pt males depended on the strain of the females used to produce the F1 progeny. When SENCARA Pt females were used (compared to BALB cAnPt females) to produce F1 mice, about 45% of the backcross mice were susceptible (compared to 15% for BALB cAnPt). This result suggested the possibility that a susceptibility locus resides on the X chromosome. However, a determination of LOD scores for 16 polymorphic Mit markers on the X chromosome showed that the highest LOD score of 1.37 was found for DXMit234, 70 cM from the centromere. Thus, susceptibility loci on the X chromosome do not explain our result. We are currently determining the susceptibility of backcross mice bred using SENCARA females crossed to F1 males to see whether susceptibility can depend on the female parent of the male mice. We have demonstrated a marked synergism for tumor promotion between the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and agents that elevate intracellular calcium, such as thapsigargin or the calcium ionophore ionomycin, suggesting a role for calcium in tumor promotion by phorbol esters. Synergism was not found at effective promoting doses of TPA, but was seen at suboptimal or non-promoting doses of TPA. The mechanism by which elevation of calcium increases promotion by TPA may involve a conventional isoform of protein kinase C (such as protein kinase C alpha) or another calcium-activated pathway. Transgenic mice which overexpress protein kinase C alpha in the basal layer of the epidermis and hair follicles have been developed in LCCTP. These mice have been bred to study the possible role of protein kinase C alpha in the enhancement of TPA promotion by thapsigargin. A high initiating dose of DMBA is followed by low doses of thapsigargin and or TPA. Promotion by either thapsigargin or TPA is much more effective in the PKC alpha transgenics relative to littermate controls. However, tumor formation in mice pretreated with thapsigargin prior to each treatment with TPA was not enhanced in the PKC alpha transgenics. Activating mutations in the K-ras oncogene, rarely seen in mouse skin tumors, are frequent in rapidly-arising tumors on the skin of mice initiated by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and promoted by mezerein. Only a few K-ras mutations were seen in skin tumors from MNNG-initiated mice promoted with TPA. Mouse skin tumors initiated by 7,12-dimethylbenzaanthracene (DMBA) and promoted by either TPA or mezerein display mutations in H-ras but not K-ras. The mechanism of the selective action of mezerein in the promotion of MNNG-initiated skin tumors may be related to the K-ras and mezerein-activated protein kinase C pathways in skin. We have analyzed skin tumors from this experiment for methylation of the promoter for the gene encoding the DNA repair enzyme MGMT, and found methylation in 41% of papillomas and 51% of carcinomas. Methylation was found more frequently in tumors initiated by DMBA and in tumors promoted by mezerein. Methylation of MNNG-initiated carcinomas was not seen in the earliest carcinomas, but was significantly increased in the later-appearing carcinomas with promotion by either TPA (p=0.007) or mezerein p=0.048). We found no significant association between methylation and the initiating mutations in either H- or K-ras; methylation appears to be associated with the later stage of malignant conversion. MGMT promoter methylation prevented MGMT expression as determined by immunohistochemistry. Individual tumors in which MGMT was not expressed were methylated at only 1-5 CpG sites, indicating that a low level of methylation can prevent MGMT expression. Methylation at the CpG sites at -22 and -122 bases upstream from the transcription start site are critical in reducing MGMT expression. Methylation at CpG sites at -383, -413, and -415 bases did not correlate with MGMT expression. In the same set of tumor samples, p53 mutations were characterized in 132 skin tumors. Mutations, found in about half of benign and malignant tumors, were most frequent in exons 10 (47%) and 4 (22%), with fewer mutations in exons 5, 7 and 8. Mutations in p53 were more frequent 1) in tumors initiated by DMBA compared to MNNG, and 2) in early tumors compared to late tumors. Most mutations involved a base pair substitution, but no single type predominated. The unexpectedly wide spectrum of p53 mutations suggests that they are not the direct result of carcinogen damage.\",\n",
       " 'The goal of this project is to determine the mechanism by which cellular signaling pathways target chromatin with a particular focus on signaling mediated through cyclic nucleotides. At gene promoters targeted by various signaling pathways, histones are often found to be modified in response to activation of these pathways. The changes in histone modification influence the activity of these promoters in a variety of ways. In addition, some histone modifications in bulk cellular chromatin are found to be cell cycle dependent. For example, chromatin-associated histone H3 becomes globally phosphorylated just prior to mitosis and is then dephosphorylated upon exit from mitosis. The signaling cascades which lead to both gene-specific and bulk changes in histone modifications are still largely unknown. In the process of studying histone modification at the MMTV promoter in response to signaling pathways, we determined that cAMP signaling causes a drastic reduction in bulk levels of histone H3 phosphorylation in our breast adenocarcinoma cell lines. Further investigation of this phenomenon showed that it is targeted to the mitotic population of phosphorylated histone H3. In fact, cAMP signaling prevents cells from phosphorylating histone H3 at multiple sites due to G2 arrest and inhibition of mitotic entry. Outside of DNA damaging agents, examples of G2 arrest are rare. Unlike normal cells, many cancer cells have been found to be G1 checkpoint deficient, forcing them to rely heavily on the G2 checkpoint to repair genetic damage. This has led some to propose the development of anti-cancer drugs which abrogate the G2 checkpoint. Tumor cells unable to repair genetic damage would eventually undergo apoptosis. Normal cells, which are G1 checkpoint competent, can repair genetic damage prior to DNA replication, and would be far less sensitive to the effects of G2 checkpoint abrogators. Unfortunately candidate targets for such agents are limited because our knowledge of events which occur during the G2 phase of the cell cycle is relatively incomplete. Study of signaling-induced G2 arrest may elucidate novel regulatory mechanisms for G2 progression and identify additional targets for G2 checkpoint abrogation. Our current and future studies will be directed at understanding the molecular events which lead to cAMP-induced G2 arrest and loss of the ability of cells to achieve mitotic levels of H3 phosphorylation. We are particularly interested in determining how cAMP-induced G2 arrest might be different from that induced by DNA damage. Because of its effects on cell cycle progression, we are very interested in the cAMP-induced pathway which leads to this effect. Protein kinase A (PKA) and Epac are thought to mediate most cAMP effects in non-neuronal cells. Interestingly, specific antagonists of PKA do not inhibit cAMP-induced loss of H3 phosphorylation and specific agonists of Epac do not induce it. In collaboration with Dr. Hans-Gottfried Genieser (Biolog Institute, Bremen, Germany) we took a chemistry-based approach to characterize the cAMP receptor which functions in our pathway by screening a large variety of chemically-modified cyclic nucleotides. Through these results we have reached the following conclusions: 1.) the receptor is cAMP-specific and does not bind cGMP, 2.) the cyclic nucleotide binding properties of the receptor are not consistent with PKA, Epac, or the Cyclic Nucleotide-gated Ion Channels (CNGs), and 3.) the activation of the receptor does not correlate with the membrane permeability of various cAMP analogs. In fact, some analogs considered to be membrane impermeable efficiently induced the loss of H3 phosphorylation. This leads us to hypothesize that the receptor may either be extracellular and bind cAMP outside the cell, or intracellular, but coupled to a cyclic nucleotide transporter or pump. Both scenarios imply that cAMP could be inducing the pathwas through extracellular action. Evidence for extracellular action of cyclic nucleotides in mammals has slowly accumulated over the years but a mammalian homolog of the extracellular cAMP receptor in Dictostylium has never been identified. In humans the liver excretes cAMP into the blood and it is thought to act on the kidney from the extracellular space. In addition, there are reports of extracellular effects of cGMP in neuronally-derived cells and tissues. Our current studies are directed at determining the site of action of cAMP and the localization of the cAMP receptor which mediates G2 arrest',\n",
       " 'The conjugation of proteins with ubiquitin involves the sequential action of proteins known as E1s (ubiquitin activating enzymes), E2s or UBCs (ubiquitin conjugating enzymes), and E3s (ubiquitin protein ligases). We have characterized a family of closely related E2s and gone on to establish that Nedd4, which is related to E6-AP (the E3 that ubiquitinates p53 in the presence of human papilloma virus E6) in its carboxyl-terminus, is an enzymatically active E3. More recently we have utilized an E2 enzyme (UbcH5B) in the yeast two-hybrid system in the hope of isolating novel E3s. This has resulted in the isolation of cDNAs encoding a protein that binds UbcH5B and related E2s both in vivo and in vitro. This protein, AO7, is notable for a RING finger that is required for its E2 binding and to mediate its own ubiquitination. This led to the determination that a number of otherwise unrelated RING finger-containing proteins including BRCA1, Siah-1, and c-Cbl have the capacity to mediate ubiquitination. We also have evidence that the RING finger of Mdm2 provides the molecular basis for the E3 activity of Mdm2 both towards itself and toward p53. Structure-function analysis of RING finger proteins suggests conserved residues other than the zinc-coordinating Cys and His are required for function, and additional analysis suggests that other divalent cations can substitute for zinc in active RINGs. One area of ongoing study is oriented towards the structural characterization of the Mdm2 RING finger and in the identification of both naturally occurring and small molecule inhibitors of Mdm2 E3 activity. Our work on the structure of the Mdm2 has been a technical challenge and has now evolved into attempts to co-purify the Mdm2 RING finger along with that of MdmX, with which it dimerizes. Our studies looking for inhibitors of Mdm2 have resulted in the identification of a family of compounds that inhibit Mdm2 E3 activity both in vitro and in cells. Additionally, our screens have also resulted in the identification of a cell-permeant E1 inhibitor, which should be of great value for experimental purposes and may also serve as the basis for new therapeutics with functions similar to proteasome inhibitors, which are now in clinical trials. In addition to the work on Mdm2 other structure-functions studies are oriented towards understand the function or RNF6 and RLIM and of BRAP2.',\n",
       " \"Infectious diseases in addition to causing acute and sometimes chronic infections are also a leading cause of many common cancers including gastric cancer, cervical cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and nasal pharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and lymphoma. However, the role of host genetic factors in host resistance, chronic infection and pathogenesis leading to disease and or malignancies is not well understood. Variation in genes encoding proteins providing acquired and innate immunity, proteins required for the completion of the viral lifecycle, and tumor suppressors may affect individual susceptibility to the initial infection and the outcome of chronic infection. The investigation of host genetic factors that modify HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and disease progression or that may predispose to NPC or heptocellular carcinoma may lead to better understanding of host resistance and pathogenesis in response to common pathogens and may lead to targeted therapeutic interventions. It is likely that innate immunity is particularly important in retroviral infections since it takes several days for the host to mount an immune response, too late to provide protection against proviral intergration into the genome. We are currently focusing our efforts on host genetic factors that confer innate immunity by blocking HIV-1 replication post-cell entry before productive infection is established. APOBEC3G, a cytodine deaminase belonging to the APOBEC RNA-editing enzyme family, blocks HIV-1 replication by inducing G to A hypermutation in newly synthesized viral DNA; however, this suppression is blocked by HIV-1 Vif (virion infectivity factor). After HIV-1Vif forms a complex with the host protein Cul5, it binds to APOBEC3G preventing the encapsulation of APOBEC3G in the newly formed virion. Wildtype HIV-1 is able to replicate in the presence of APOBEC3G whereas HIV-1 Vif strains cannot. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variants of the APOBEC3G gene may affect HIV-1 transmission and disease progression in 5 HIV-1 natural cohorts. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were screened in the 5'-untranslated region, 8 exons, exon-intron junctions, and 3'-untranslated region and seven SNPs were identified. The homozygous variant allele of H186R, a nonsynonymous change in exon 4 present only in African Americans, was associated with accelerated rate of progression to AIDS and death in African Americans. Two haplotypes carrying the variant allele of 199376G C, located in intron 4, were also modestly associated with accelerated disease progression, separately in European- and African-Americans. The results suggest that APOBEC3G may play a role in the genetic modulation of HIV-1 disease. APOBEG3G is a very strong candidate as a target for therapeutic intervention. The functional basis for these associations is not yet understood; however, we are now testing the hypothesis that these variant alleles are associated with altered gene expression. We are also investigating the evolution of APOBEC family members to determine if other APOBEC RNA editing enzymes are involved in HIV-1 diseases. Recent studies have found that APOBEC3F and APOBEC3B also strongly inhibit HIV-1 activity in vitro. We have genotyped haplotype tagging SNPs in AIDS cohorts and found they were weakly associated with more rapid progression to AIDS, primarily Pneumocytis carinii. In addition, we are investigating the role of RNA editing enzymes in AIDS-related lymphoma. HIV-1 associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is characterized by oncogenic changes in B cell DNA, induced by activation-induced cytidine deaminase AICDA. We have screened over 400 HIV-1-associated lymphoma cases and controls for 6 SNPs in the AICDA gene. The ability of HIV-1 Vif to suppress antiviral activity of APOBEC3G is specifically dependent on Cul5-SCF function, allowing Vif to interact with APOBEC3G and induce its ubiquitination and degradation.\",\n",
       " ' We have identified three new genes expressed in cancer cells: POTE, ankrd26 and NGEP. We have shown NGEP is a cell surface protein expressed on many prostate cancers and promotes the aggregation of LNCAP prostate cancer cells when over-expressed in these cells. In collaboration with Dr Schlom we are working to develop a vaccine for prostate cancer treatment and have identified 2 T cell epitopes as promising vaccine targets. NGEP is a polytopic membrane protein and we have determined its orientation in the plasma membrane. Using this information we are trying to make antibodies to the extra-cellular domains of the protein that can be used to make immunotoxins, immunoconjugates or for other antibody-based therapies of prostate cancer. The other two genes encode intracellular proteins and we are trying to determine their function. Preliminary experiments in which POTE is over-expressed in cells suggest that POTE may promote apoptosis. We have made a strain of mice in which the ankrd 26 gene is partially inactivated and these mice become very obese and also have an increase in organ size. Using the yeast 2 hybrid system we have identified several proteins that appear to associate with ankrd 26 and are using this information to determine the biochemical pathways by which ankrd26 controls obesity. One defect in these mice is that they have very high leptin levels yet continue to eat indicating there is a defect in the brain that makes them leptin unresponsive. We have also prepared antibodies to ankrd26 and are determining which cells in the brain contain ankrd26. ',\n",
       " 'The Ly49 and KIR families are comprised of both inhibitory and activating receptors; the latter interacting and signaling through DAP12. We have continued our dissection of the proximal events associated with DAP12 signaling over the review period. The result of this work includes the definition of an apparent defect in DAP12 signaling in mice of the 129 Sv background that can profoundly effect the analysis of gene targeted mice, delineation of two levels of regulation of DAP12 signaling by CD45 (signal initiation and dephosphorylation of DAP-12 itself), and most recently, dissection of the overlapping use of the non-catalytic adaptor proteins Linker for Activation of T cells (LAT) and the Linker for Activation of B cells (LAB). TREM-1 regulates sepsis whereas TREM-2 can control the development of DC, microglia and osteoclasts. Our studies of the TREM cluster have led to publications regarding; 1) the identification of TREM-like transcript-1 (TLT-1), a protein that does not couple to DAP-12 but instead interacts with SHP-1; 2) characterization of TLT-1 as a platelet specific receptor sequestered in alpha granules; and 3) identification of soluble TLT-1 in serum, and solution of the crystal structure of the extracellular domain. We have also targeted TLT-1 in mice, shown its role in platelet aggregation in vitro, and defined some proteins that interact with it. Although platelets and thrombosis can regulate inflammation, cancer growth and metastasis, and adaptive immunity, we have chosen not to propose further TLT-1 studies under our base allocation here. If however, sufficient resources were available, we would continue biochemical study of TLT-1. We are currently, evaluating our TLT-1- - mice in collaboration with a former fellow from our lab.',\n",
       " \"Annual Report, 9 12 08 paragraph: Our section directs clinical trials of recombinant toxins at the NIH and in the lab studies the interaction of these toxins with the patient's malignant and normal tissues. Therapy of patients with chemotherapy resistant hematologic malignancies has been remarkably effective with Fv-toxins recombinant immunotoxins) targeting CD25 or CD22 in hairy cell leukemia and efficacy is also observed in other hematologic malignancies. The anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin BL22 produces complete remissions (CRs) in a high percentage of patients with hairy cell leukemia who have a low chance for CR with conventional therapies. Patient samples are studied in the lab to better predict and understand recombinant toxin efficacy, to better understand the role of cytotoxic T-cells observed in hairy cell leukemia patients, to study novel and established tumor markers in patients to better quantitate overall tumor burden, and to develop new assays of minimal residual disease. Our goal is to develop bacterial toxins which are engineered to kill cancer cells in patients who cannot be cured by standard therapy. The binding domain of the bacterial toxin, usually Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE), is replaced with a ligand, either a growth factor or an Fv fragment of a monoclonal antibody (MAb), which binds to a tumor associated antigen. Thus the recombinant toxin binds to and is internalized by malignant cells and causes cell death after the catalytic domain of the toxin enters the cytosol of the host cell. BL22 is a recombinant immunotoxin containing an anti-CD22 Fv fused to truncated PE. We had previously shown in the lab that BL22 was capable of inducing complete regressions of human CD22+ tumor xenografts in mice at plasma concentrations tolerated in monkeys and in killing malignant cells freshly obtained from patients with CD22+ B-cell leukemias. We completed accrual of 46 patients in a phase I trial of BL22 in patients with B-cell tumors, 31 of whom had hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Of these 31 HCL patients, 19 (61%) achieved CR and 6 (19%) had partial responses (PR). A phase II study was designed to retreat only those HCL patients not achieving hematologic remission to cycle 1. We observed 25% CRs and 25% PRs after 1 cycle, and 47% CRs and 25% PRs overall. Patients with moderate splenomegaly (up to 200 mm), have a significantly higher response rate (95%) compared to those with prior splenectomy (44%) or those with larger spleens (20%). BL22 has an excellent risk-benefit ratio in HCL since no patients died and all toxicity resolved. BL22 is also being tested in patients with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. HA22, a variant of BL22 with higher affinity for CD22, is also being developed. We have compared this molecule with BL22 against cells ex vivo from patients with CLL and have found significant improvements in efficacy. HA22 has begun clinical testing in 3 separate multicenter phase I trials, for HCL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Major responses included 6 (38%) CRs and 6 (38%) PRs out of 16 evaluable HCL patients. Responses were observed at all dose levels including 3 of 3 PRs at the lowest dose level, and 1-2 CRs at each of the next dose levels. The maximum tolerated dose has not yet been determined since no patient has had severe toxicity. We found that soluble CD22 could be detected in the serum and its level correlates closely with overall disease burden. Another phenomenon studied is expansions of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), associated with limited repertoire of polyclonal T-cells, related to purine analog treatment. BL22 treatment had no adverse effect on T-cells. Monitoring CTLs in patients with HCL after purine analogs may be very useful to gauge the T-cell repertoire and could be used to help decide whether relapsed patients should receive a repeated course of purine analog or instead try biologic T-cell-sparing therapy. It is known that purine analogs cannot eliminate HCL cells. By cloning the cDNA for surface IgG displayed on the hairy cells, we have developed a novel sequence-specific PCR test for HCL. While flow cytometry, currently the most sensitive test of minimal residual disease (MRD) in HCL, is able to detect 1 HCL cell in 10,000 normal, clone-specific quantitative PCR is able to detect 1 HCL cell in 1,000,000 normal. This is by far the most sensitive test yet developed for MRD in HCL. We are prospectively cloning surface IgG in patients treated with BL22 to determine if BL22 can eradicate malignant cells after repeated cycles. We have also accumulated a large database of sequences of surface IgG expressed by HCL cells. We find significant differences in expressed IgG between patients with HCL and the poor prognosis variant, HCLv, with respect to both gene usage and mutation frequency. LMB-2 is an anti-CD25 recombinant immunotoxin which we previously showed in phase I testing was active in HCL, CLL, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), and Hodgkin's disease (HD). We are currently testing LMB-2 in phase II trials in patients with CLL, CTCL and HCL. We have observed clinical responses in these trials. To determine if chemotherapy can prevent immunogenicity of immunotoxins, a trial is opening soon in which patients with adult T-cell leukemia will be treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by LMB-2. We have completed a phase I trial of the anti-mesothelin recombinant immunotoxin SS1P in patients with mesotheliomas, ovarian carcinoma, and pancreatic carcinoma. SS1P was administered by continuous infusion. Targeting solid tumors was much more challenging than targeting hematologic tumors, since patients were more likely to develop neutralizing antibodies, and tumors were less likely to be penetrated by immunotoxin. Nevertheless, evidence of antitumor activity was observed in several patients. Lessons learned in these studies should be useful in improving the treatment of patients with both solid and hematologic tumors lacking effective alternative therapies.\",\n",

       " 'Engagement of multicomponent immunoreceptors such as the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) results in rapid activation of multiple protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) including Lck, Fyn, ZAP-70 and Itk. These PTKs then phosphorylate a number of enzymes and adapter molecules involved in a complex signaling cascade. Our studies have focused on a critical substrate of the PTKs, LAT (linker for activation of T cells), a 36-38kD integral membrane protein. LAT is a critical transmembrane adaptor protein. We have performed studies to characterize how LAT is phosphorylated and binds a number of critical signaling molecules, thus bringing these other adaptor molecules and enzymes to the plasma membrane in the vicinity of the activated TCR. Biochemical, biophysical, genetic and microscopic techniques are currently employed to study the characteristics of LAT-based signaling complexes. A critical pathway activated after TCR engagement and primarily dependent on the LAT molecule is the ERK pathway. A number of our older studies demonstrated how interaction of the enzyme phospholipase C gamma with a particular phosphorylated tyrosine of LAT results in activation of an enzyme cascade leading to ERK activation. Nonetheless in some T cells of mice bearing a mutant form of LAT incapable of binding this phospholipase C isoform, ERK activation can be activated. Studies completed this year demonstrate that an additional adapter molecule, Bam32, is found in T cells. It also is coupled to pathways leading to ERK activation. The role of this molecule in T cell activation in normal and our mutant mice is under investigation. In addition to biochemical and genetic studies of signaling molecules the laboratory has developed new methods of visualizing T cell activation using confocal microscopy. Many of the signaling molecules involved in the early TCR-coupled activation process have been tagged with fluorescent markers and expressed in T cells. The group has used these methods to observe the process of the assembly of signaling molecules into signaling clusters at the site of T cell activation. In studies completed this year we demonstrated that following TCR activation and signaling cluster formation, signaling molecules are internalized in a process dependent on the Cbl molecule, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. An additional study used our imaging techniques to demonstrate how the recruitment of signaling molecules at the point of activation is dependent on small G proteins of the Rab family. The use of imaging techniques to probe intracellular signaling in live, single cells continues to reveal important new facts about T cell activation.',\n",
       " \"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which arises in the epithelial cells of the nasopharynx, exhibits a strong association with Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Although it is a relatively rare malignancy in most populations, it is a substantial source of cancer morbidity in Southern China. NPC occurs among family members of patients and disease risk has been linked with HLA, although the HLA associations differ by ethnic group. We are studying the effects of these genes in a case-control study of NPC involving 618 individuals from Taiwan. These individuals have been typed previously for the HLA-A and HLA-B loci. We have now completed typing HLA-C and the killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) locus in these individuals and the analysis is ongoing. We have proposed that the presence of activating KIR expressed on natural killer (NK) cells may aggravate autoimmune and inflammatory pathogenesis by inducing NK cell-mediated cytokine secretion and cytolysis. Data from our lab that supports this hypothesis was observed in a group of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) attending the University of Toronto Psoriatic Arthritis Clinic under the care of Dr. Dafna Gladman. In a related study, we have genotyped KIR HLA in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a chronic, systemic, inflammatory rheumatic autoimmune disease of the axial skeleton. Although multiple genes are probably involved in susceptibility to AS, HLA-B27 exhibits the strongest association identified to date, with more than 95% of patients being B27 positive. The AS samples have been obtained from Addenbrooke's Hospital at Cambridge University, and the Royal National Hospital of Rheumatic Disease, through our collaborators Drs. Rachel Allen and John Trowsdale (Cambridge University). The chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are idiopathic, inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract that are thought to result from inappropriate and ongoing activation of the mucosal immune system. Recently, our collaborators combined linkage results of genome-wide scans from five independent studies using an algorithm called genome search meta-analysis. A locus at 6p, which contains the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), showed the strongest evidence for linkage to disease across the five studies. In collaboration with Dr. John Rioux (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), we have begun a pilot study in which 200 individuals with Crohn's disease and 200 matched (age, gender, geographic location, and ancestry) controls, as well as 200 sets of mother-father-IBD affected child trios will be typed for the HLA class I and KIR genes to determine whether previously identified HLA associations with IBD can be attributed in part to KIR genetic variation. If associations are identified, then we will confirm these effects with additional samples from the Genetics Core of the Quebec IBD Genetics Consortium, which is directed by Dr. Rioux. Thus far, we have received approximately 500 samples and are in the process of genotyping them. In addition, we are also collaborating with Dr. Kathy Siminovitch at the University of Toronto and have received approximately 1200 samples from her IBD cohort. Genotyping of these samples will begin once the first set of IBD samples is typed. Genetic analysis of HLA KIR in these diseases may provide information regarding a general tendency of predisposition to autoimmune disease among individuals with specific activating KIR.\",\n",
       " 'Epidemiological analysis of syringe sharing behaviors among IDUs are typically based on self-reports and are subject to socially desirable responding. We have developed and applied three short tandem repeat (STR) genetic biomarkers to detect sharing in 2512 syringes exchanged by 315 IDUs in the Baltimore needle exchange program (738 person-visits). Demographic characteristics, direct and indirect needle sharing behaviors corresponding to the closest AIDS link to the intravenous experience (ALIVE) study visits were examined for association with multi-person-use of syringes. Overall, 56% of the syringes exchanged at Baltimore needle exchange program (NEP) had evidence of multi-person-use of syringes. Less multi-person-use of syringes (48 vs. 71%, p less than 0.0001) was seen with more rapid syringe turnaround (less than 3 days). IDUs always exchanging their own syringes (\"primary\" syringes) were less likely to return syringes with evidence of multi-person-use (52%) than those who exchanged syringes for others (\"secondary\" syringes); (64%, p=.0001), and those exchanging both primary and secondary syringes (58%, p=.004). In a multivariate analysis restricted to primary exchangers, multi-person-use of syringes was associated with sharing cotton (AOR=2.06[1.30-3.28]), lending syringes (AOR=1.70[1.24-2.34]) and injecting less than daily (AOR=0.64[0.43-0.95]). These findings support additional public health interventions such as expanded syringe access to prevent HIV and other blood-borne infections. Testing of STRs represents a promising approach to examining and accessing complex behavioral data including syringe sharing.

       " 'The C EBP family of transcription factors consists of six members with similar DNA binding specificity, which can homo- and heterodimerize with each other. The long term goal of this project is to elucidate the developmental and molecular functions of individual C EBP proteins in normal cell growth control and during tumorigenesis. Specifically, we are using mouse models that lack either the C EBPbeta (Cebpb) or the C EBPdelta (Cebpd) gene in research on four organ sites. 1) Ovary: Cebpb-deficient ovarian granulosa cells are unable to differentiate in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) and therefore cause infertility. Thus, we are using hormone stimulated ovarian tissue as a tool to identify target genes of Cebpb by microarray hybridization technology. Furthermore, we found that Cebpd is a target of LH specifically in Theca cells, and that it is overexpressed in these cells from women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.2) Skin: Cebpb-deficient mice are completely refractory to skin carcinogenesis. We are using a mouse model with a conditional null allele of Cebpb in combination with various transgenic mice to further characterize the role of Cebpb in keratinocyte specific tumor development.3) Lung: Cebpd is expressed constitutively in the lung. Using mouse lung epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo we obtained evidence that Cebpd is a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Using mouse embryo fibroblasts as a model we discovered a role of Cebpd in maintenance of genome stability as a potential pathway for its tumor suppressor function.4) Mammary: Cebpb-deficient mice display impaired mammary gland development. We are using a mouse model with a conditional null allele of Cebpb in combination with various transgenic models to further characterize the role of Cebpb in mammary epithelial cell growth, differentiation and tumorigenesis. In the mammary gland, Cebpd is expressed specifically at the onset of involution. We found that the involution process is delayed in Cebpd-deficient mice with specific alterations in expression of apoptosis regulators. Based on this phenotype, we are studying the potential of Cebpd to induce cell death in human breast tumor cell lines, and we are testing the effect of Cebpd mutation on mouse mammary tumor models.In summary, these approaches shall contribute to our understanding of the role and mechanisms of C EBPs in cell growth, survival and death in vivo. This knowledge should enable us to better understand growth regulation in different normal and malignant cell types and possibly lead to the discovery of pathways amenable for diagnostics or therapeutic intervention.',\n",
       " '1) Novel technology was developed to monitor site specific binding of nuclear receptors to response elements with intact cells. Using GFP-tagged receptors and a cell line with amplified gene arrays, relative receptor binding could be correlated with gene output by measurement of the RNA FISH signal. Images were analyzed with a novel automated computer algorithm, allowing acquisition of data from large numbers of cells. 2) Although gene regulation often appears deterministic in the average cell population, transcription was found to be highly stochastic process at the single cell level. We find that regulatory proteins associate with target chromatin via a probabilistic mechanism that produces cell to cell variability in steady-state binding. This highly dynamic and probabilistic behavior of multiple regulators at target chromatin supports the return to template transcription model. 3) NF-kB can control its own activity by inducing inhibitor genes, producing negative feedback loops. We monitored endogenous NF-kB behavior using a GFP knock-in system. Oscillations in nuclear NF-kB were found to be sustained, with several cycles of transient nuclear translocation. Inhibition of negative feedback disrupted the oscillations and genome-scanning activities. This work contradicts widely held assumptions regarding NF-kB function. 4) Circulating glucocorticoids have been shown to be released from the adrenal gland in a highly pulsatile, or ultradian, secretion mode. The dynamics of GR interaction with regulatory elements during these cycles was found to fluctuate in concert with the changes in extracellular hormone concentration. Transcription rates for GR target genes (determined by nascent RNA) were shown to vary markedly between ultradian and constant ligand treatment regimens, leading to the postulate that the ultradian mode of hormone secretion is required for biologically accurate regulation of gene targets by GR.',\n",

       " 'The human papillomaviruses (HPV) are major etiologic agents of several human cancers and have been found in essentially all cervical cancers and a significant number of other anogenital cancers as well as oral, laryngeal, and nasal cancers. Cervical cancers are associated with a high risk subset of HPVs of which HPV-16 is the most common. The E6 and E7 viral oncogenes interfere with the functions of p53 and pRb, respectively, and thus disrupt regulation of the cell cycle and promote genomic instability. The E6 protein has also been shown to induce expression of telomerase. Only a subset of individuals with HPV infection will develop persistent infection, and only some of those individuals will develop low-grade lesions and an even smaller number will develop high-grade lesions and invasive cervical cancer. It is likely that additional environmental and genetic factors predispose individuals to progression. In addition, progression of high risk HPV infection to high grade lesions and invasive cervical cancer requires significantly long lag periods, consistent with the accumulation of additional genetic and or epigenetic changes. These changes are manifested by alterations in cellular gene expression as well as key changes in the biological behavior of the cells. The goals of this project are to use microarray gene expression profiling and other methods of assessing gene expression to: 1) Identify biomarkers that predict which lesions will progress to cancer and which will remain benign or regress. 2) Identify pathways disrupted during cervical cancer progression. 3) Identify changes in cellular gene expression induced by HPV infection.

       " 'Human liver cancer, with increasing occurrence in the United States, is the 5th most prevalent malignant disease in the world. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality, which accounts for an estimated 1 million deaths annually. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major type of primary liver cancer. HCC is considered to be a terminally ill disease and currently, there is little progress toward the discovery of efficient therapies leading to regression. This is due largely to the lack of a method for early diagnosis and the lack of information on the phenotypic changes associated with the development of HCC. Our goals are to identify common gene clusters that are responsible for the genesis of HCC and to discover new genes critical for viral hepatitis-mediated HCC as well as genes necessary for metastasis. For example, by comparing liver samples from chronic liver disease patients with varying degrees of risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma, we have identified unique fingerprints that may be useful in diagnosing patients with early onset of liver cancer. By comparing hepatocellular carcinoma with or without accompanying metastasis, we have identified a molecular signature that can be used to predict liver cancer patients with a potential to develop metastasis or recurrence. In addition, we are examining the role of the liver microenvironment in metastasis and recurrence by focusing particularly on the functions of immune cells and the inflammatory process in liver cancer progression. We have also identified several potential therapeutic targets that may be used to eliminate liver cancer cells or stop metastatic progression. Currently, we are exploring the roles of these genes in liver cancer initiation and metastasis. Our findings have been extremely fruitful as they may not only offer utilities to patient managements, but also challenge the current paradigm of tumor evolution. Clearly, gene expression profiling has expanded our knowledge of the global changes that occur in liver cancer, and has provided numerous insights into the molecular mechanisms of this disease. In addition, these studies will undoubtedly contribute to the establishment of novel markers with potential diagnostic and prognostic value, as well as potential therapeutic targets for direct clinical intervention of this disease.',\n",
       " 'GWAS was initiated with the purpose of identifying new genes, called AIDS restriction genes (ARGs), which influence the likelihood of HIV infection and the time of progression to AIDS. Such a study does not require prior biological knowledge for the identification of new ARGs. Over the last two decades, the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity (LGD) has obtained samples from several patient cohorts that were selected and characterized from particular at-risk groups (men who have sex with men, hemophiliacs, intravenous drug users, and others). In many cases, lymphoblastoid cell lines have been established as a source of renewable DNA. We have identified over 6,000 subjects from these cohorts who are highly informative for HIV infection or progression hypotheses. Currently, 1,808 of these subjects have been interrogated for 906,600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping platform. In addition, 744,000 probes distributed across the genome are being used to detect copy number variation (CNV). We have developed bioinformatics software that can assess the very large data sets produced by this study. Prior to performing genetic association analyses, we evaluate genotype quality by determining: 1) the call rate on both a per person and per SNP basis, 2) accuracy based on an internal replication control design, 3) consistency with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and 4) consistency with Mendelian inheritance. We perform tests for genetic association with infection or rate of progression using categorical analysis or by survival analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model. Change in log viral load and square root CD4 decline are estimated using a linear mixed effects model with random effects included for each individual to account for the longitudinal nature of the data. Dominant, additive, and recessive models are explored for each SNP. Genetic association analysis of AIDS and other complex diseases is both strengthened and complicated by the existence of multiple outcomes. In particular, these complicate correcting for multiple tests in large scale association studies since associations with different outcomes represent multiple correlated tests. We have developed a method using principal component analysis on permuted association data (\"PCPD\", Principal Components of the Permuted Data) that replaces the correlated outcomes with a set of independent outcome principal components. Further, this method generates a single P-value estimate for the overall genetic association. In order to reduce the false positive associations due to population substructure, our study populations are tested for population genetic homogeneity by using the STRUCTURE algorithm and our genetic association analyses are corrected for population stratification by the EIGENSTRAT method. We have developed software tools for the visualization of the large number genetic association results produced by a GWAS. These include ARG-ARRAY which displays statistical significance in a heat map format, ARG-BROWSER which shows candidate ARGs in their genomic context, and the ARG-HIGHWAY program which allows inspection of several million gene association tests spanning large genome segments dispersed across each of the 24 human chromosomes as well as mitochondrial DNA.',\n",
       " 'The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) frequently infected hemophiliacs who received non-heat-treated clotting factor concentrates prior to 1985. In addition, these individuals were universally infected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) with >80% remaining chronically infected. Thus, hemophiliacs represent an important population for studies of the natural history of these chronic viral infections. Moreover, the high rate of co-infection makes it an ideal group for assessing the interaction between the viruses and the relationship between viral-specific immune responses and clinical progression. Co-infection by these chronic viral pathogens is becoming increasingly common, particularly among intravenous drug users, who account for approximately 25% of the epidemic in the United States. We have investigated issues related to HIV-1 and HCV immunopathogenesis by studying children and adolescents enrolled in the Hemophilia Growth and Development Study (HGDS). The HGDS enrolled 333 hemophiliacs of whom 207 are HIV-1 co-infected, between 1989 and 1990 and followed them for 7-8 years. A total of 332 hemophiliacs had 1-8 repeated annual HCV RNA measurements between baseline and 7 years of follow-up. CD4+ cells and plasma HCV RNA were measured annually in all subjects, and plasma HIV RNA was measured annually in the HIV-infected subjects. We have previously reported that high HCV viral load was associated with increased morbidity and mortality in HIV-1 co-infected hemophiliacs and that HIV-1 infection was associated with increased risk of persistent HCV infection. We are now investigating the role of viral-specific immunologic responses in controlling HIV-1 and HCV replication and how these responses are regulated by the immune system. Genetic polymorphisms that affect T cell differentiation may influence Th1 Th2 balance and the effectiveness of the immune system in mounting a cytotoxic response to specific HIV-1 and HCV epitopes. We have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in regulatory or noncoding regions of cytokines known to have a role in determining Th1 Th2 states. These will be analyzed for correlations with the strength and breath of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) immune responses to HCV and or HIV viral peptides. We have completed HCV genotyping on the entire HGDS cohort and are now investigating the role of HCV genotype on HIV-1 clinical progression to AIDS and on HIV-1 RNA levels. We have complete genotyping for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in more than 100 genes, including APOBEC3G and TRIM5, that are involved in immune regulation, viral entry, and the successful completion of the viral life cycle. Host genetic variation in HIV-1 chemokine co-receptors and their ligands have been shown to modify rates of HIV-1 progression by altering surface expression and availability of co-receptors for HIV-1 binding. However, their influence on HIV-1 viral load is less well defined. We have tested the effects of more than 100 SNPs on HCV clearance and have identified several immune response modifiers that influence clearance. The identification of genetic factors that influence HIV or HCV pathogenesis by restricting viral replication may provide targets for potential therapeutic intervention or provide clues to factors involved in successful immune regulation by CTLs.',\n",
       " 'Biological membrane proteins participate in a wide variety of vital cellular functions such as material exchange, energy conservation, cellular communication, and detoxification. As estimated by the pharmaceutical industries, 95% of all available drugs interact with targets that are membrane bound. In the human genome, membrane proteins constitute 30% of open reading frames, yet the number of membrane protein structures determined to date is disproportionally small. Although structural knowledge for this class of proteins is being actively pursued, even more so following the initiative of the NIH road map, structural data for membrane proteins at atomic resolution are only being obtained slowly due to various practical obstacles. The picture gets even worse for eukaryotic membrane proteins; excluding those of mitochondrial origin, only a few eukaryotic membrane protein structures have been determined to date at atomic resolution. My group studies the structure and function of a few selected families of membrane proteins using a combination of biochemical and crystallographic methods. One protein family of particular interest includes those involved in cellular multidrug resistance such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and related ABC family proteins. In collaboration with Drs. Ambudkar and Gottesman of LCB, we are actively pursuing crystallization of P-gp. In addition, my lab has been working on expression, purification and crystallization of various P-gp related proteins for crystallographic studies. Technically, to obtain a membrane protein structure, four major obstacles must be overcome: (1) achieving high-level protein expression, (2) obtaining pure and mono-dispersed proteins in large quantity, (3) growing diffraction quality crystals, and (4) solving crystallographic phase problems, often at relatively low resolutions, for membrane proteins. All these difficulties are due in large part to the fact that membrane proteins have large hydrophobic surfaces. Membrane proteins, especially eukaryotic membrane proteins, are difficult to express in large quantities and in active forms in commonly available expression systems. Successful heterologous expressions of membrane proteins are always achieved in a case-by-case situation. Currently, the most common approach to express large amounts of active membrane protein is to screen for high-level expression of a large number of homologs, mostly those of prokaryotes in various expression systems. Achieving high-level expression of membrane protein is perhaps one or two orders of magnitude more difficult than high-level expression of soluble proteins. Even in the case of very high-level expression, the amount of the target membrane protein is rarely over 30% of the total membrane proteins in cell membrane (2% for P-gp, 5% for LmrA, and 2% for Pdr5p), making purification of a large amount of protein difficult without large-scale fermentation and cell disruption facilities. Furthermore, successful high-level expression in test tubes does not guarantee success when scaling up. Membrane proteins are often associated with each other in a non-specific manner (polydispersity) when purified, which is detrimental to successful crystallization; this problem can sometimes be eliminated by screening for different detergents and solvent conditions. When purified, membrane proteins exist in solution as protein-detergent complexes; the available hydrophilic surface that is useful for specific crystal contact is limited. It is quite common to screen for over 30,000 conditions before a diffraction quality crystal form can be found. It has been successful in a few cases to artificially increase the hydrophilic surface by attaching conformational sensitive monoclonal antibodies to target membrane proteins. Our group is also working towards improving existing or devising new technologies to facilitate crystallization of membrane proteins.',\n",
       " \"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze glutathione conjugation with electrophilic compounds. In preneoplastic and neoplastic cells, specific forms of GSTs are expressed at high levels and to participate in the cells' resistance to anticancer drugs. Class pi GST (GSTP) is of particular importance in biological resistance to alkylating agents. Therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting GSTP to extend the efficacy of alkylating agents have been unsuccessful. However, GSTP-activated prodrugs have shown great potential in targeting specific cancer cells. We have developed a new type of anticancer agents, O2-aryl diazeniumdiolates, which kill cancer cells by releasing nitric oxide intracellularly (Australia Patent Number 733590, 2001; US Patent Number 6610660, 2003; and European Patent Number EP 0 929 538 B1, 2004). Using structure-based approach, GSTP specificity has been achieved with two structural modifications of the prodrug. 6-Hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) is a key enzyme in the folate biosynthetic pathway, catalyzing the transfer of pyrophosphate from ATP to 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (HP). Folate cofactors are essential for life. Mammals derive folates from their diets, whereas most microorganisms must synthesize folate de novo. Therefore, HPPK is an ideal target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents. We have mapped out the trajectory of HPPK-catalyzed reaction by determining the three-dimensional structures of apo-HPPK (ligand-free enzyme), HPPK-MgATPanalog (binary complex of HPPK with one substrate), HPPK-MgATPanalog-HP (ternary complex of HPPK with both substrates), HPPK-AMP-HPPP (ternary complex of HPPK with both products), and HPPK-HPPP (binary complex of HPPK with one product), and obtained a wealth of structural information for structure-based design of novel antimicrobial agents. RNA POLYMERASE-ASSOCIATED TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS Stringent starvation protein A (SspA) of Escherichia coli is a transcriptional activator for the lytic development of phage P1, and is essential for stationary phase-induced acid tolerance. We have determined the crystal structure of Yersinia pestis SspA, which is 83% identical to E. coli SspA in amino acid sequence and is functionally complementary in supporting the lytic growth of phage P1 and acid resistance of an E. coli sspA mutant. The structure reveals that SspA assumes the characteristic fold of glutathione S-transferase (GST). However, SspA lacks GST activity and does not bind glutathione. Functional roles of the structural features of SspA were investigated by assessing the ability of deletion and site-directed mutants to confer acid resistance of E. coli and to activate transcription from a phage P1 late promoter, thereby supporting the lytic growth of phage P1. The results indicate that a surface pocket is important for both transcriptional activation of the phage P1 late promoter and acid resistance of E. coli. The size, shape, and property of the pocket suggest that it mediates protein-protein interactions. RNA-PROCESSING PROTEINS Members of the Ribonuclease III (RNase III) family are double-stranded (ds) RNA-specific endoribonucleases, characterized by a signature motif (ERLEFLGDS) in their active centers and a two-base 3' overhang in their products. While Dicer, which produces small interfering RNAs, is currently considered the most important member, the founding member was bacterial RNase III. Facilitating dsRNA processing, RNase IIIs are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Bacterial RNase III, containing an endonuclease domain (endoND) and a dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD), can affect RNA structure and gene expression in either of two ways: as a processing enzyme that cleaves dsRNA, or as a regulatory protein that binds dsRNA without cleaving it. \",\n",
       " 'Cancer arises when the normal controls on cell survival and proliferation are disrupted as a result of genetic mutations. Recent work has implicated the CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C EBP) family of transcription factors in regulating cell growth and survival and demonstrates their involvement in tumorigenesis. The C EBP family is composed of five members - C EBPalpha, beta, gamma, delta and epsilon - that are expressed in cell-specific patterns and regulate transcription by binding to select target genes. Our laboratory uses knockout mice as well as cell lines derived from these animals to elucidate the functional roles of the various C EBP family members in controlling cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. A major focus of our research is to elucidate the role of C EBPbeta in cellular transformation induced by oncogenic Ras or its downstream effector kinases. C EBPbeta is a widely expressed nuclear protein that is post-translationally activated by Ras signaling, suggesting that it could serve as a nuclear effector of oncogenic signals transmitted via the Ras pathway. In support of this idea, we previously showed that C EBPbeta-deficient mice are completely resistant to the development of skin tumors induced by the carcinogen, DMBA (this project was a collaboration with Robert Smart, North Carolina State University, and Esta Sterneck, NCI-Frederick). Normal mice subjected to this protocol develop epidermal papillomas that carry mutations in the Ras proto-oncogene. Thus, C EBPbeta is absolutely essential for skin tumorigenesis in an experimental animal model. We also found that C EBPbeta null animals display significantly greater numbers of apoptotic cells in the epidermis after carcinogen treatment compared to wild type mice, suggesting that C EBPbeta is involved in suppressing programmed cell death in pre-cancerous cells. To our knowledge, C EBPbeta is the only mutation that completely blocks DMBA-induced skin tumor development. Since C EBPbeta activity is regulated by Ras signaling, we hypothesize that C EBPbeta is an essential component of the Ras-dependent tumorigenesis pathway in epidermal keratinocytes. We are currently investigating whether C EBPbeta is essential for other cancers using a variety of mouse tumor models. If it has a widespread role in growth and survival of cancer cells, C EBPbeta may be an promising target for the development of novel anti-tumorigenic agents. In another study, our laboratory demonstrated that C EBPbeta function is required for neoplastic transformation of macrophages. In contrast to wild-type cells, C EBPbeta- - bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with a Myc Raf-expressing retrovirus (J2) do not display growth factor independence. The ability to survive in the absence of exogenous growth factors (\"self sufficiency\") is a hallmark of transformation in many leukemias and other cancers. We found that J2-transformed, C EBPbeta nullizygous cells require macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) or similar hematopoietic growth factors for survival, whereas wild type cells can evade apoptosis without a requirement for extrinsic factors. Several lines of evidence indicate that the survival defect in C EBPbeta null cells results from impaired expression of IGF-I, a growth factor that has been shown to promote survival of many cancer cells but has not been implicated in myeloid leukemogenesis. Thus, our results demonstrate that C EBPbeta-regulated production of IGF-I provides a critical autocrine prosurvival signal in a myeloid leukemic cell. Since C EBPbeta is a critical regulator of the IGF-I gene in macrophages, we are interested in determining whether C EBPbeta also may control serum IGF-I levels. Circulating levels of IGF-I are known to be a risk factor for the development and or progression of many cancers. Serum IGF-I expression is modulated by environmental factors such as caloric intake. Therefore, we have undertaken studies to determine whether C EBPbeta mediates dietary regulation of serum IGF-I levels and, subsequently, cancer risk. These experiments are currently in progress and are being performed in collaboration with the laboratories of Steve Hursting and Carl Barrett (CCR, NCI). The regulation of C EBPbeta activity by Ras signaling is likely to underlie its role as an effector of Ras-induced transformation and tumorigenesis. Hence, our laboratory is interested in determining the mechanism by which C EBPbeta is activated upon engagement of specific Ras effector pathways. In this regard, we and others have shown that the DNA-binding activity of C EBPbeta is autorepressed. More recently, we observed that C EBPbeta becomes de-repressed and is capable of binding to DNA in cells over-expressing oncogenic Ras or stimulated with growth factors. The sequences responsible for autorepression map to the N-terminal portion of the molecule and involve at least three distinct regions of predicted secondary structure. Studies to determine the structural basis for autorepression are currently in progress as a collaboration with Maria Miller and Alex Wlodawer (NCI-Frederick). We have also identified several sites of phosphorylation on C EBPbeta that are induced by Ras signaling and we are currently investigating how these modifications affect C EBPbeta activity. One novel phosphoacceptor site, Ser64, is a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk\\'s) and becomes phosphorylated in a cell-cycle dependent manner. Mutation of Ser64 to alanine does not affect DNA binding but disrupts the ability of C EBPbeta to enhance Ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Thus, Cdk-mediated phosphorylation of Ser64 during specific stages of the cell cycle appears to be necessary for unimpeded proliferation (or survival) of transformed fibroblasts.',\n",
       " 'Ras is a small, evolutionarily conserved GTPase that functions to transmit signals regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival and transformation. Oncogenic Ras proteins, which are constitutively activated forms of Ras, cause inappropriate cell proliferation and are associated with approximately 30% of all human malignancies. Because Ras plays such a critical role in both normal and abnormal growth processes, our laboratory has focused its research on elucidating the components involved in and the mechanisms regulating Ras-dependent signal transduction. Specifically, our studies can be divided into four main areas: 1. Regulation of the Raf family of serine threonine kinases. The Raf kinase family serves as an essential intermediate in many signaling cascades, functioning to relay signals from activated Ras to the downstream protein kinases MEK and ERK. Moreover, deregulated or constitutively active Raf proteins can themselves cause cell transformation and mutations in the Raf family member B-Raf have been observed in 67% of malignant melanomas as well as in many colorectal, ovarian and papillary thyroid carcinomas. Our goal in this project is to examine the means by which the Raf kinases becomes activated and inactivated during growth, development, and oncogenesis. 2. Function of Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR). KSR was discovered to be a positive effector of Ras signaling by genetic studies performed in Drosophila and C. elegans. Our investigation of the mammalian KSR protein has been to determine the specific mechanism(s) by which KSR functions to transduce Ras-dependent signals. 3. Mass spectrometry analysis of Ras pathway components. Several components of the Ras pathway, such as the Raf kinases and the scaffolding proteins KSR, CNK and SUR8, are found in high molecular weight complexes in mammalian cells. To identify the constituents of these complexes and to isolate other potential regulators of the Ras pathway, our laboratory has begun a comprehensive analysis of these protein complexes utilizing the NCI mass spectrometry facility. 4. Ras signaling pathways in Drosophila. Due to the complex nature of cellular signal transduction, our laboratory has had an ongoing interest in using Drosophila as a model system for studying signaling events. We are currently using this system to identify novel proteins involved in Ras-dependent signal transduction.',\n",
       " \"Intermediates of phospholipid (PL) and sphingolipid (SL) metabolism serve as second messengers for a number of signaling cascades including activation of G-protein-coupled receptors such as adrenaline, thrombin, etc., as well as receptor tyrosine kinases by growth factors. They mediate a number of processes ranging from protein secretion to activation of apoptosis. We have initiated studies to understand different aspects of lipid signaling in Drosophila.Lipid Reservoirs and Signaling. Sphingomyelin (or phosphorylethanolamine ceramide in flies) could serve as a reservoir for several lipid messengers such as ceramide, ceramide 1-phosphate, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate. We have initiated studies to delineate the in vivo role of some of the enzymes of the putative 'Sphingomyelin Cycle'. We have begun by identifying homologous genes in Drosophila. We are using transgenic and mutagenic studies to analyse the importance of such a pathway in Drosophila. We have recently demonstrated that modulation of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway such as targeted expression of ceramidase, rescues degeneration in certain photoreceptor mutants. We have also demonstrated that ceramidase facilitates membrane turnover and rhodopsin endocytosis in Drosophila photoreceptors.Lipid Distribution and Signaling.PL and SL at the plasma membrane play an important role in stimulus-response coupling, cell differentiation, movement, and exo- and endocytosis. They are asymmetrically distributed in biological membranes, and different proteins catalyzing uni- and bi-directional movements of lipids perpetuate asymmetry. Our current efforts focus on scramblase, a protein proposed to be involved in bi-directional transbilayer movement of phospholipids. We have recently completed two genetic screens and obtained Drosophila flies lacking two of the identified scramblase proteins. We have also generated flies lacking both genes (double mutants). Phenotypic analysis of double mutant indicate that surprisingly scramblases do not have a determining role in scrambling of phospholipids that accompany apoptosis, phagocytosis and fusion. Instead, they play a regulatory role in regulated exocytosis. This has implication in a wide range of cellular processes involving digestive system and endocrine and exocrine secretions with clinical relevance in a wide range of diseases such as diabetes, behavior and even tumor metastasis.We anticipate that a combination of genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches in Drosophila will define the important players involved in PL, SL signaling in their normal cellular environment.\",\n",
       " 'Cancer arises through the co-operation of mutations that allow uncontrolled cell proliferation. The loss of cell and tissue homeostasis caused by this proliferation triggers apoptotic cell death in the potential tumor cell. This death serves to limit tumor development. Thus the acquisition of additional mutations that uncouple the pro-apoptotic effects of oncogenes from the apoptotic machinery is a critical step in tumorigenesis. Complex networks of signaling pathways control the apoptotic response, and so cell survival. However, these complex networks converge on a common apoptotic machinery. Central to the death machinery are a family of cysteine proteases called caspases. These proteases are expressed as inactive precursors (zymogens) that are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases can cleave and so activate other caspases but inactive caspases can also undergo autocatalytic activation when recruited into multi-protein complexes. For example, ligands such as Fas or TNF bind to their cognate receptors causing the formation of a protein complex called the DISC that contains and activates caspase-8 or -10. Once active these initiators can, in turn, activate effector caspases such as -3, -6 and -7 that cleave a wide range of cellular substrates. It is this second wave of proteolysis that brings about the morphological and biochemical changes of apoptosis. While in some instances caspase-8 can apparently activate capase-3 directly, in other cases caspase-8 acts indirectly by activating Bid which releases cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. Like caspase-8, caspase-2 which is activated by different apoptotic stimuli, can also generate as yet unknown factors that release cytochrome c. In the cytosol cytochrome c interacts with Apoptotic Protease Activating Factor-1 (Apaf-1), which then binds and activates caspase-9, forming an Apaf-1 caspase-9 holoenzyme. This holoenzyme then activates the effector caspases. Thus activation of the Apaf-1 caspase-9 holoezyme may play a critical role in integrating and amplifying the signals from diverse apoptotic stimuli. The goal of this section is to understand the biochemistry of caspase activation with the aim of using this knowledge to identify novel targets for cancer therapy. To this end, the section is currently studying two areas of the apoptotic process. First, and where most effort is directed, Apaf-1-dependent caspase activation. Second, Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP) stability and caspase inhibition.',\n",
       " 'The bacterium Escherichia coli has a single, circular chromosome that is replicated and segregated with great precision to daughter cells during cell division. Replication proceeds bi-directionally from a single origin and terminates on the opposite side of the chromosome. The relative simplicity of this system and the limited number of cell components required for its propagation make it a model system for DNA replication and segregation in general. We have developed a P1 parS GFP-ParB system for localization by fluorescent microscopy of any desired locus on the E. coli chromosome in living cells. Using similar DNA recognition systems of different specificities, we can now label up to three chromosomal loci simultaneously, using three differently colored fluorescent proteins. The technique works well in living cells and allows us to follow the fate of chromosomal sequences through several generations by time-lapse microscopy. In addition, we have used the technique, in combination with flow cytometry, to determine the spatial distributions of given loci at defined points in the cell cycle in a cell population. This effort has been greatly augmented by collaboration with the laboratory of Flemming Hansen, the Technical university of Denmark. With him, have developed automated methods for the measurement of the positions of fluorescent foci in the cells that permits accurate measurement of thousands of cells from microscopic images. We are also developing rapid methods for the analysis of the large data sets that we are able to collect. These methods provide us with powerful tools for the investigation of the replication and segregation dynamics of the chromosome. So far, we have been able to disprove the currently popular model for chromosome segregation involving simultaneous segregation of the bulk of the DNA. Rather, we show clearly that DNA is segregated progressively as it is replicated. Our investigations are revealing unexpected features of DNA organization and motion, including the fact that the two arms of the circular chromosome lie in opposite halves of the resting cell. We have been able to conclude that DNA segregation proceeds in concert with replication in a process that may resemble the formation of separable sister chromatids in higher organisms. In the past year, we have initiated a study of chromosome segregation at fast growth rates where the initiation of chromosome replication becomes uncoupled from the cell division cycle and the cells become functional diploids. Under these conditions, cell division occurs while chromosome replication is ongoing. We have found that segregation continues to be driven directly by replication so that segregation of chromosome domains can occur in generations previous to the one in which the regions are placed in separate cells by cell division. We are currently investigating many other aspects of the process, and hope to be able to derive a complete description of the segregation process in the near future. The visible properties of DNA replication and segregation need to be linked to the biochemical and structural properties of the macromolecules involved in the key events. To date, we have made significant progress in understanding the role of the SeqA protein that is involved in both replication and segregation of the chromosome. In collaboration with Dr. Alba Guarne (McMaster University) we have solved the crystal structure of the SeqA protein in a complex with its cognate DNA sequence. Using the structure as a guide, we have constructed mutant proteins and have determined their effects on DNA replication and segregation. These studies have lead us to a working model for the roles of SeqA that is currently being tested. We have made progress this year in visualizing the SeqA protein in living cells and studying the dynamics of its localization to the moving replication forks. This should allow us to describe the dynamic behavior of the replication forks within the replicating chromosome and to further our knowledge of the role of the SeqA protein in DNA segregation. Current investigations center around the ability of the bacterial chromosome to undergo overlapping replication cycles at high growth rate. This poses a special problem for chromosome segregation because replication is always ongoing, and the segregating structure has multiple replication forks. We have discovered that the earliest regions of the chromosome are segregated to their future positions soon after replication, and up to two generations before they are placed in separate cells. Thus, regions around the origin of replication are present in eight copies in fast growing cells prior to division, and these copies are already separated in eight \"proto-nucleoid\" structures. This result was obtained by population contour mapping of multiple markers near the replication origin and was made possible by our ability to plot the positions of markers in many thousands of cells by the automated data gathering and processing technique that we have developed.',\n",
       " 'Our research focuses on the regulation of gene expression, in particular the mechanisms controlling cellular and viral mRNA expression. A critical step in the mRNA metabolism is the transport of the mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Analysis of retroviral systems, pioneered by research on HIV-1, have shed light into some important aspects of nuclear mRNA export and these studies have provided critical insight into mechanisms governing cellular mRNA and protein transport. We are utilizing retroviral systems to identify and study mechanisms of mRNA metabolism using a combination of biochemistry, functional genomics, and proteomics. The dissection of the mechanisms of posttranscriptional control and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of macromolecules are relevant to understand processes involved in cellular gene expression as well as virus expression. Since posttranscriptional regulation is an essential step in virus propagation, our studies also focus on the understanding of this regulatory step in pathogenesis of HIV and SIV. Recent data from my lab identified the cellular PSF protein as a factor interacting with distinct HIV-1 mRNAs and inhibiting their expression, hence virus production. The role of PSF in the posttranscriptional regulation of cellular mRNAs is under investigation. The identification of CTE and CTE-related RNA transport elements as well as their receptor, the cellular TAP NXF1 protein, enabled us to further dissect its mechanism of function. NXF1 is also the key receptor for cellular mRNAs, and we demonstrated that this function is conserved in metazoa. We also found that NXF1 binds to the splicing factor U2AF35 which provides a novel link between splicing and export of mRNA. We are currently examining the role of the other members of the NXF family. In collaboration with George Pavlakis (Vaccine Branch), we study a novel RNA transport element RTE. The mechanism of function of RTE is still under investigation but it appears that RTE has hijacked the NXF transport pathway. Interestingly, we found that a combination of RTE and CTE synergistically increases production of poorly expressed viral mRNAs. Since the function of these elements is conserved in mammalian cells, the use of the RTE-CTE combination provides a simple method to improve gene expression to levels otherwise only achieved via more cumbersome RNA optimization.',\n",
       " 'Developmental systems are controlled by modulating gene expression in response to internally programmed signals responding to external signals. Our laboratory is interested in studying the molecular interactions and the signaling that occur to regulate gene expression and the cell cycle. We exploit the genetic systems available in Escherichia coli, its plasmids, and its viruses (e.g., bacteriophage lambda) to help us understand (1) regulation at the levels of transcription initiation and elongation, translation initiation, and cell growth and cell cycle control signals and (2) Recombination and cloning using lambda Red functions. The N gene of lambda is the first gene expressed following viral infection. The function of the N protein is necessary for expression of most other lambda genes by its actions as a positive regulator. Positive activation of other genes occurs by N binding to specific RNA sites called NUT, modifying the RNA polymerase transcription complex. This modified polymerase complex reads through transcription terminators to distal lambda genes. Thus, the expression and action of N are central to the control of lambda development. We have recently determined that N is subject to novel posttranscriptional regulatory circuits. Expression of the N gene is autoregulated by N binding to the NUT RNA site 150 bases upstream of the N gene, from which the translation of N 100-fold over this long distance. The N-modified RNA polymerase complex is required for this translational repression. Thus, antitermination and translation repression by N are coupled. This may be caused by a specific folding of the RNA structure into a long duplex that brings the NUT RNA into close juxtaposition with the N ribosome binding site. RNaseIII, a ds RNA endonuclease, recognizes the stem structure and cleaves it, separating NUT from the N RNA. This cleavage prevents N translational repression but actually enhances antitermination, presumably by releasing the antitermination complex from its interaction with the NUT RNA. The degree of RNaseIII processing of the N-leader controls the amount of translation repression by N. Since RNaseIII expression itself is controlled by growth rate of the cells (see below), the cellular growth rate determines how much N protein will be made during a lambda infection. In rich media, high levels of RNaseIII exist in the cell thereby preventing any repression of N, while in poor media low levels of RNaseIII exist which is insufficient to prevent repression of N levels. The biology and development of lambda depends upon N levels which is modulated by RNaseIII and growth rate. Additionally, we have found that RNaseIII is expressed from an operon in which an essential low-molecular-weight GTP-binding protein, Era, is also encoded. From this operon, RNaseIII and Era expression is coordinately regulated and increases in relation to growth rate. This growth rate regulation of RNaseIII and Era occurs at the posttranscriptional level, but the mechanism remains unknown. The accumulation of adequate levels of Era is essential for cytokinesis to be completed and cell growth to continue. We speculate that a threshold level of Era must accumulate before Era-GTPase is activated by a cellular signal to cause cell division and to allow cell growth to continue. Era binds to precursor RNA and may use this binding as a measure of RNA synthesis and the signal to activate its GTPase. We believe RNaseIII and Era are key components that couple regulation of growth and the cell cycle. The crystal structure of both proteins has now been determined. A model for dsRNA cleavage by RNase III has been postulated from the structures. Because RNase III of eukaryotes is the active component in RNA-inhibition (RNAi), the structure and mechanism of cleavage by RNase III is of critical importance in understanding RNAi.',\n",
       " \"Recently, we have developed an in vivo cloning and gene modification system using lambda-mediated homologous recombination (Red). This system eliminates the need to cut DNA with restriction enzymes or join DNA fragments with DNA ligase. This extremely efficient recombination system will we believe, revolutionize the way in which recombinant DNA work is done. Both ssDNA oligos (as short as 20 bases) and linear dsDNA (as short as 30 bp) can be used to generate recombinants on the bacterial chromosome, on plasmids, or on genomic BAC library clones. ssDNA oligos have been used to create point mutations, to repair mutations, to create deletions, and to create small insertions on the chromosome and in BAC clones. Recombination of ssDNA requires only the lambda phage Beta protein which binds the ssDNA oligonucleotide that is electroporated into cells and anneals that nucleotide to its target homology in the cell. Annealing occurs to the ssDNA intermediates that form during replication. Recombination of long dsDNA (>1000bp) requires lambda phage functions Exo and Gam in addition to Beta. Exo degrades 5' ends of dsDNA generating ssDNA overhangs for Beta to bind. Gam inhibits host nucleases which destroy the entering linear DNA. Various bacterial vectors have been developed to ensure efficient and accurate genetic engineering via this in vivo recombineering technology.\",\n",
       " 'Acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation of the histones and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling turned out to be universal components of this epigenetic gene regulation. Large protein ensembles known as chromatin remodeling complex RSC and histone chaperone FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) alter nucleosomes or their higher order arrays to make chromatin more accessible to transcription. Pol II itself and transcription elongation factors such as TFIIF, TFIIS, elongin, and pTEF-b may also work to establish and maintain the active state of the chromatin. Finally, our own results suggest that transcription elongation factors and chromatin modifiers may cooperate in the elimination of the chromatin barrier to transcription. Based on these findings, Pol II elongation factors and chromatin modifiers re-modelers are considered promising targets for new anti-cancer drugs, which may help to re-gain transcription control of growth-promoting genes, as well as to overcome silencing of genes with the tumor suppressor functions. We establish an in vitro system for dissection of the chromatin remodeling mechanisms associated with transcription elongation and investigation of a crosstalk between Pol II elongation factors and chromatin re-modelers. I plan to dissect these mechanisms using mono and poly nucleosomal templates, yeast Pol II, and the purified transcription elongation factors and chromatin remodeling complexes. The utilization of yeast Pol II to understand gene regulation in higher eukaryotes is justified because: (i) yeast and mammalian RNA polymerases have the same subunit composition, and overall share more than 50% sequence identity and more than 80% sequence similarity; (ii) nucleosome organization is completely conserved in all eukaryotes, and (iii) the yeast allows an easy combination of biochemical and genetic approaches, which is practically impossible in mammalian systems. Thus, the future findings in this single cell organism have very high translational potential.',\n",
       " 'Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) comprise a family of 22 members that govern a wide spectrum of cell biological behaviors such as proliferation, cell death, migration and gene expression. Increased expression of specific members of this family, such as Fgf8, play an important role in the progression of both breast cancer and prostate cancer. To understand how such abnormal Fgf8 expression affects cell function in cancer, our long-term goal is to determine the normal role of Fgf8, during vertebrate embryogenesis, using the mouse as a model system. Fgf8 is expressed in a variety of regions of the embryo that may be termed \"organizers\": regions that are a source of signals that pattern and thus \"organize\" the surrounding tissue. Previously we have generated an allelic series generated at the Fgf8 locus (Meyers et al. 1998 Nature Genetics 18:136), as well as Cre-mediated tissue-specific knockouts (Lewandoski et al. 2000 Nature Genetics, 26:460; Lewandoski 2001 Nature Reviews Genet. 2:743; Lewandoski 2007 Handb Exp Pharmaco 178: 235) and revealed a role for Fgf8 in organizers that control gastrulation, limb, and brain development. Recently we have produced a valuable mouse line (T-Cre) that expresses Cre specifically throughout all embryonic mesodermal lineages, thus allowing us to control gene expression in these lineages. This line is useful to bypass the embryonic lethal phenotypes of genes that affect early development, yet allows the study of the role of such genes throughout much of the embryo (Verheyden et al, 2005 Development, 132: 4235; Wahl et al, 2007 Development, 134; 4033; Dunty et al Development, 135:85; Aulehla, A. et al, 2008 Nat Cell Biol., 10:186; MacDonald S.T. et al 2008 Cardiovasc Res. , 79: 448; Kumar A, et al, 2008 Dev. Dyn., in press) . Inactivation of Fgf8 with TCre has revealed that Fgf8 plays a central role in cell survival and gene expression during kidney development (Perantoni et al 2005, Development, 132: 3859). Another surprising insight emerging from these studies is that Fgf8 is not required for several mesodermal signaling centers that control the process of somite formation, where it was thought to play a role. To investigate this, we are studying mutants in which Fgf8 and each of the other five Fgfs expressed in these regions are simultaneously inactivated. Importantly, we have uncovered a redundant role between Fgf4 and Fgf8 in somite formation. This functional redundancy has implications for cancer as both FGFs have been found to be aberrantly active in testicular tumors. Furthermore this redundancy has implications for evolution as the same FGFs play compensatory roles in limb development. One of the intriguing insights that has emerged from these studies is that at different stages of embryogenesis FGF signaling plays different roles in cell migration, proliferation, patterning, and survival. How is this diversity of response achieved To answer this question, we are studying downstream targets of FGF signaling. One set of such target genes is the homeobox genes Gbx1 and 2. The role of the mouse Gbx2 gene during neurulation and particularly in defining the mid hindbrain organizer has been well documented. We have extended this analysis by studying a hypomorphic (partial-loss-of-function) Gbx2 allele, which has revealed that Gbx2 is required at certain threshold levels for different parts of the brain (Waters and Lewandoski 2006 Development, 133: 1991). Compared to Gbx2 relatively little has been reported about Gbx1. We recently described the cloning and embryonic expression pattern of Gbx1 and defined regions of potential molecular redundancy with Gbx2. (Waters et al 2003 Gene Exp. Patterns. 3:313). We are currently studying mice with an allelic series at the Gbx1 locus to study it\\'s function during development, including its role in FGF signaling and its interactions with Gbx2.',\n",
       " '<I>Rx< I> is target of FGF8 signaling in the developing eye. It is first expressed in mouse embryos at during gastrulation in the presumptive forebrain and becomes restricted to the developing retina, posterior pituitary and hypothalamus. Deletion of the <I>Rx< I> gene revealed that it is required for the formation of these structures, as its loss causes anophthalmia and ventral neural tube defects. To determine the role of <I>Rx< I> later in eye development and in adult retina physiology, we have produced mice that carry a conditional <I>Rx< I> allele so that normal <I>Rx< I> function can be disrupted by Cre-mediated recombination. Inactivation of <I>Rx< I> in the developing optic vesicle causes two defects: the lens doesnt form and the optic vesicle forms retinal pigmented epithelium at the expense of neural retina. Our data supports a model in which <I>Rx< I> is required for <I>Bmp4< I>, <I>Fgf8< I>, and <I>Fgf8 15< I> expression, which in turn is required for proper development of the eye.',\n",
       " 'Our research concerns the mechanism and consequences of Ty (Transposon yeast) element retrotransposition in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ty elements comprise five related families of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons that transpose via an RNA intermediate. The Ty genome contains two genes, TYA and TYB, which correspond to the gag and pol genes of retroviruses, respectively. The retrotransposon is transcribed into a nearly genome-length RNA, which is the template for reverse transcription by the self-encoded reverse transcriptase protein and for translation. Ty protein maturation and reverse transcription take place within Ty virus-like particles (Ty-VLPs), which appear to be essential for the transposition process. Although Ty-VLPs accumulate in the cytoplasm, a sub-VLP preintegration complex containing Ty cDNA, the element-encoded integrase and perhaps other proteins probably is required to transit the nuclear membrane, and mediate integration at preferred chromosomal locations. We are particularly interested in the biology of Ty1 elements because these elements are the most abundant, competent for transposition, and their RNA transcripts accumulate to an exceptionally high level. Despite the abundance of Ty1 RNA, however, mature Ty1 proteins and VLPs are present at low levels, and Ty1 transposition events are also very rare. Although Ty1 elements preferentially integrate upstream of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III, Ty1 insertions can mutate essentially any yeast gene, form large complex multimeric insertions of 100 kb or more, and can also initiate chromosomal deletions, inversions and translocations by homologous recombination with other Ty1 elements in the genome. Information gained from studying Ty elements has been successfully applied to several other areas of biomedical research. For example, understanding how Ty elements transpose in yeast has led to a greater understanding of how retroelements in other organisms including humans function, because many of these elements are related. Over 40% of the human genome is comprised of retroelement sequences, such as LINE and SINE, intracisternal A-type particle, and endogenous retroviral elements. Most importantly, genome rearrangements and insertional events involving these elements have been implicated in human disease and cancer. Further computational analyses of mammalian genome sequences coupled with functional genomic analyses of cancerous cells will likely reveal new roles for retroelements that can be modeled in yeast using Ty elements or their mammalian counterparts. In addition, many aspects of the retrotransposon replication cycle are similar to those of retroviruses, including HIV. Therefore, steps in the process of retrotransposition can be compared and contrasted with similar processes in retroviruses to learn more about both classes of elements. Over the past year, we have made progress in the following areas. In our continuing effort to identify cellular genes that modulate Ty1 retrotransposition, we have surveyed all members of the RAD2 family of nucleases, which are required for genome stability. We have shown that only Rad27 Fen1, a highly conserved structure-specific nuclease important for lagging strand DNA replication, inhibits Ty1 mobility by altering the fate of unincorporated cDNA. We have discovered a novel form of post-transcriptional cosuppression that controls Ty1 element copy number. A decrease in the synthesis of Ty1 cDNA is strongly correlated with post-transciptional cosuppression. Unlike the conserved RNAi pathways that cosuppress transposable elements in a variety of eukaryotes, the level of Ty1 RNA increases with the addition of elements to the genome, yet genomic Ty1 retrotransposition decreases.',\n",
       " 'The availability of complete genome sequences is beginning to have a profound impact on structural biology. For the first time, it is possible to select targets from among many thousands of open reading frames, any of which can easily be retrieved from its genome through the power of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Understandably, this perspective has conjured up visions of structural biology on a grand scale, creating a new field that has come to be known as \"structural genomics\". Yet, transforming this dream into reality will require technical advances that increase the speed with which the three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules can be determined. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated strategy for protein expression and purification that will be suitable for large-scale structural biology initiatives. The term \"high-throughput\" is often used in connection with structural genomics. However, we believe it is more appropriate to think in terms of \"high-output.\" After all, what matters in the end are not how many experiments that one does but how many successful outcomes one has to show for it. Output is a function of two variables: input and efficiency, the latter being a measure of how many targets that enter the pipeline successfully emerge from the other end. In principal, output can be augmented by increasing either of these variables. Our research focuses on trying to maximize the efficiency of protein production. This would be an uphill battle if protein expression were a completely haphazard venture, but we do not believe this is the case. While we recognize that no single method will succeed all of the time, experience has taught us that some approaches are, on average, consistently more productive than others. Our goal is to merge these high-probability approaches into a coherent strategy for \"maximum likelihood\" protein expression and purification that will enable us to increase output by improving efficiency, irrespective of the scale of the project.Central to our approach is the liberal use of genetically engineered affinity tags. The advantages of affinity tags are compelling: they can improve the yield of a recombinant protein, help protect it from intracellular proteolysis, enhance its solubility, and facilitate its purification. We believe that the collective attributes of affinity tags far outweigh their potential disadvantages. Moreover, it is impossible to imagine a generic process for the production of recombinant proteins that does not involve affinity tags. Having committed ourselves to the tagging approach, our objective is to derive the maximum possible benefit than we can from affinity tags. Affinity tags are not all the same; some perform certain tasks better than others do, and so we need to be cognizant of the advantages and disadvantages of various tags in order to use them to maximum advantage.We have been particularly interested in exploring the influence of affinity tags on the solubility of recombinant proteins, because insolubility is a major problem in protein expression and purification, and refolding of proteins seems incompatible with high-output applications. Through trial and error, we have discovered that one tag in particular, E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP), has an amazing ability to improve the solubility and promote the proper folding of its fusion partners. Because we believe this to be a rare and valuable attribute, we have adopted MBP as the cornerstone of our affinity-tagging strategy. One of our ongoing objectives is to understand the underlying mechanism of the solubilizing effect so that we can better manipulate it to our advantage. We also hope to learn something of a more fundamental and general nature about the process of assisted protein folding by studying this model system in detail. Although MBP has some powerful advantages, it is not a particularly good affinity tag for protein purification.',\n",
       " 'Our success in producing large quantities of crystallization-grade proteins led to a small-scale structural genomics project aiming to solve the three-dimensional structures of proteins involved in Type III secretion in Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague. Because the Type III secretion system (T3SS) is essential for virulence, the resulting structural information could be used to develop effective countermeasures for this potential agent of bioterrorism. We have already solved 12 novel structures and are in the process of solving more of them, including several protein-protein complexes. In one case, we have already begun the process of structure-based drug development. One of the cytotoxic effector proteins that Yersinia injects into mammalian cells via the T3SS, YopH, is a potent eukaryotic-like protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase). YopH dephosphorylates several proteins associated with the focal adhesion in eukaryotic cells, thereby enabling the bacterium to avoid phagocytosis and destruction by macrophages. In collaboration with Dr. Terrence Burke Jr. (Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, CCR) and Dr. Robert Ulrich (USAMRIID), we have identified several compounds that inhibit YopH with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. Thus far we have managed to crystallize one of these with the enzyme and solve the co-crystal structure at 2.2 A resolution. The resulting structural information suggested several ways in which the potency of the inhibitor might be improved, and these possibilities are currently being explored. In addition, we have determined a high-resolution structure (1.5 A) of the YopH PTPase in complex with a nonhydrolyzable hexapeptide substrate analog, providing us with yet another starting point for the development of inhibitors. We have recently expanded our range of targets for structural studies to include virulence factors from other potential agents of bioterrorism, including the variola major (smallpox) virus and Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia. Crystal structures of proteins from both of these sources have recently been determined. One of them is currently the focus of another structure-based drug development project.',\n",
       " 'Nucleosomes are \"transparent\" to transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in vivo, but not in vitro. The nature of the strong in vitro barrier to Pol II is unknown. Nucleosomes survive transcription in vivo, but passage of Pol II generates an \"open\" chromatin state where a high-order nucleosome structure is disturbed. During transcription, the individual nucleosomes change their position on DNA, some histones dissociate from the histone octamer, and the histone tails become chemically modified. The relationship between all these alterations and the strength of the nucleosomal barrier is mostly circumstantial. This is due to the lack of an in vitro system where the biochemical details of the process can be analyzed. We accomplished this goal by designing the \"minimal\" in vitro system where core enzymes of the yeast Pol II, Pol III, and E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) transcribe through a positioned mononucleosome.',\n",
       " 'Over the past decade the genetics of development and cancer have converged in the identification of signaling pathways that control embryo patterning and, when aberrantly regulated, lead to cancer. Typically, tumors form in tissues in which the pathways normally operate. Tumors arise due to oncogenic mutations in components of these pathways that lead to ligand-independent constitutive activity. A classic example is the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, an essential developmental pathway that is disrupted in several kinds of tumor. Mouse Wnt1 is a prototypical oncogene first identified when it was shown that activation of Wnt1 by integration of Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus led to cancer of the mammary gland in mice. Mutations in several components of the Wnt beta-catenin pathway have identified both oncogenes and tumor suppressors in this pathway that lead, in particular, to colorectal cancer. Recently, we have shown that aberrant Wnt signaling may lead to cancers of the immune system, specifically T-cell lymphomas. A large-scale survival study has revealed that relatively late-onset lymphomas and thymomas arise in Tcf mutants older than 6 months of age, however when one copy of Wnt5a is removed, severe, early-onset lymphomas arise as early as 3 months of age. These results suggest that Wnt5a has tumor suppressor activity. Our current experiments are aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms and suggest that Wnt5a normally antagonises the canonical pathway ie. Wnt beta-catenin target genes such as the proto-oncogene c-myc. We have also initiated a microarray project to generate a transcriptional profile of tumors so that we can molecularly compare our lymphomas with clinically',\n",
       " 'Our research focuses on the elucidation of three-dimensional (3D) solution structure and dynamics of proteins and complexes, involving protein-protein and protein-nucleic interactions, as a means of understanding the mechanism of action for these systems. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique is unique among biophysical methods in its ability to provide atomic-resolution information on such systems in solution. The primary targets of our efforts are proteins involved in the transmission of signals between and within cells and proteins controlling gene expression. By investigating the structural biology of these systems, our studies can provide insight into the complex regulation of cell replication, which is crucial to the development and proliferation of cancer. Determining 3D solution structures requires state-of-the-art capabilities in multidimensional, triple- and quadruple-resonance NMR spectroscopy and isotopic labeling of proteins and nucleic acids. We devote a part of our efforts to the development of improved NMR techniques and hardware, as well as protein engineering. Recent work in our laboratory includes the establishment of procedures for the preparation of triply labeled proteins (e.g., N15, C13, and H2) both in uniform patterns and with selective methyl protonation in an otherwise N C D background. In this reporting period, our research has involved the transcription antiterminator NusB, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the N-terminal domain of STAT4, and human interleukin-13. Preliminary work is underway on systems related to apoptosis. We have determined the high-resolution structures and investigated backbone dynamics and complexes of these proteins with their respective ligands or receptors.',\n",
       " \"The goal of the Molecular Aspects of Drug Design Section is to discover new approaches to the design of drugs against cancer and viral diseases, especially AIDS. The general strategy is to integrate information obtained from biological and molecular studies of disease development with structural data on potential drug targets to design new drugs with greater effectiveness and lower systemic toxicity. Our specific approach is to combine mechanistic, computational, and synthetic chemistry with biochemical biophysical and biological studies of the candidate drugs. DNA is an attractive target for chemotherapy because of its central role in the life of a cell. The repair of DNA damage is critical to the survival of a cell, whether normal or cancerous. The transcription of DNA into RNA, and the replication of DNA are also essential functions. Thus, in principle, selective targeting of these functions in tumor cells by small molecules may result in novel and highly selective drugs. We have found that the bifunctional agents bisimidazoacridones and the closely related bistriazoloacridones (collectively referred to as BIAs), which were discovered in our laboratory, appear to inhibit the growth human colon cancer cells in tissue culture and in nude mice by blocking the ability of the tumor cells to enter into mitosis. The binding of BIAs to the cellular DNA is recognized as damage that results in a cascade of biochemical events that block the progression of the cell through the cell cycle. If the arrested cells are then treated with inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases, which have the effect of forcing the cells to proceed into mitosis, the tumor cells die. The binding of BIAs to DNA involves both intercalation and minor groove binding. We hypothesized that one of the consequences of this mode of binding is the ability of the complex to capture a critical protein involved in repair of DNA damage or in transcription. Consideration of this hypothesis led us to propose that some Bias may be inhibitors of HIV replication. Indeed, several members of the series, especially one molecule now called temacrazine were found to have very potent anti-HIV activity. It was found that the molecular target for temacrazine is a component of transcriptional initiation. Thus, temacrazine and its congeners represent a novel class of potential drugs against HIV. The mode of binding of Bias to DNA led us to design a new class of compounds, represented by the unsymmetrical molecule WMC79, which retain many of the selectivity properties of the original Bias but are now potently cytotoxic to tumor cells. Again, the sensitive cells respond to a DNA damage signal. If the tumor cells contain un-mutated p53 tumor suppressor gene, the tumors die by apoptosis induced by p53-mediated activation of caspase 3. However, some tumors in which p53 is mutated or is not expressed are also highly sensitive to WMC79. These include some leukemia's and pancreatic cancers. These tumors are also killed by apoptosis, but the signaling pathways that lead to cell death are independent of p53. The targeting of drugs to specific receptors on tumor cells is a conceptually attractive method to enhance specificity and to decrease systemic toxicity. We have chosen the gastrin receptor (GR) as a prototype to test this hypothesis. Our work has shown that GR, a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, undergoes endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits, is transported to the lysosomes, and recycles to the cell surface. Gastrin, the ligand for GR, is a peptide hormone that can be readily modified, because only the C-terminal tetrapeptide is required for recognition by the receptor. We have attached several cytotoxic moieties to various gastrin-derived peptides. Some of these conjugates have been shown to be very cytotoxic in GR+ cells but relatively benign in GR- cells.\",\n",
       " 'In the past several years, our work has concentrated in five distinct areas. Crystallographic studies of proteases Crystallographic studies of proteases have been an important area of research of this Section since its establishment. We have been particularly active in the investigation of structure-function relationship in aspartic proteases, including clinically important retroviral enzymes. Our studies of HIV protease, although no longer a major target of active research, are still ongoing and concentrate on the investigation of drug-resistant variants and their complexes with inhibitors. We have investigated retroviral proteases from several other sources such as FIV, RSV, and HTLV-1. Cockroach allergen Bla g 2 was shown to be an inactive aspartic protease and we solved the structures of two complexes with different specific antibodies. We have established an extensive program of investigating serine-carboxyl peptidases (sedolisins), a family that was first characterized based on crystal structures solved in this laboratory and that is found in many different organisms. We are also investigating a bacterial ATP-dependent protease Lon, finding that is proteolytic domain has a unique fold and thus establishes a new family of proteases with a Ser-Lys catalytic dyad. We have also solved the structure of an aspartic protease from Trichoderma reesei, an enzyme of industrial potential. Lectins with antiviral activity We have been involved in studies of several lectins with antiviral activities, some of them currently being in pre-clinical trials as potential drugs preventing HIV infection. We have solved the structure of griffithsin, as free protein and complexed with a number of mono- and disaccharides, explaining the structural basis for its tight binding to branched mannose-rich carbohydrates. We have also solved atomic-resolution structure of another lectin, scytovirin. Proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and tumor suppression Two related serine protein kinases, Rio1 and Rio2, are involved in processing 20S pre-RNA to 18S ribosomal RNA. Their crystal structures, solved by our Section, established that they belong to a novel family of kinases with a truncated substrate-binding region, although they are capable of both self- and trans-phosphorylation. We have established the sites of autophosphorylation for both of them. We are currently investigating their catalytic properties and a potential biological role. We have also solved the structure of the C-terminal MA3 domain of Pdcd4, explaining how that tumor suppressor factor inhibits translation initiation. Cytokines and cytokine receptors Our Section has been investigating the crystal structures of several cytokines and has made progress in preparing their receptor complexes. We have purified and crystallized complexes of IL-10 with its specific receptor and are studying complexes of several other cytokines related to IL-10, such as IL-19, IL-20, and IL-22. Development of crystallographic methodology We have been investigating the problems related to phasing of diffraction data, deposition of structures in the Protein Data Bank, and improvement of the quality of crystallographic data. Several publications explaining the technique to non-crystallographers have been written.',\n",
       " 'Unlike the majority of genes expressed in mammals, imprinted genes are expressed from only one parental allele- which allele depends on the particular gene. Thus the Insulin like growth factor 2 (Igf2) is expressed almost exclusively from the paternal allele, whereas p57Kip2, a CDK inhibitor is expressed from the maternal allele. This form of gene regulation is, among vertebrates, unique to mammals. Why it exists is still unclear. Much evidence has suggested that imprinted genes are involved in regulating cell proliferation and viability. Androgenetic embryos, in which the entire genome is paternal in origin, exhibit overgrowth of the extraembryonic membranes and in increase in fetal size at mid gestation. Parthenogenetic embryos, where the entire genome is maternal in origin show retarded embryonic growth. To facilitate an understanding of imprinting and to identify novel imprinted genes, we established fibroblast lines which are either exclusively androgenetic or parthenogenetic in origin. The lines show diametrically opposite patterns of growth with the androgenetic cells having a shorter cell cycle time, reaching a higher saturation density and forming tumors, whereas the parthenotes senesced and died. Using mouse lines deficient for imprinted genes such as Igf2, one of its receptors, the Igf2r, and p57Kip2 revealed that Igf2 was a major determinant regulating proliferation and viability of these cells. In addition to these growth studies, we have used these lines to identify novel imprinted genes. Using a suppressive subtractive screen we identified the nuclear receptor cofactor repressor activator Zac1 and epsilon sarcoglycan as being imprinted genes expressed from the paternal allele, as well as an Est that is strongly expressed in the brain, and is transcribed from the maternal allele. Current studies are centered on determining the function of these genes in development and growth regulation. We are developing mouse models for a human congenital disease associated with a defect in imprinting called Prader-Willi syndrome. In this condition, newborns are hypotonic, have breathing difficulties and often fail to thrive. Those that survive develop an eating disorder and frequently become obese. The disease is associated with loss of part of the paternal chromosome 15. A homologous region is found on mouse chromosome 7. We recently described the derivation of mice lacking the paternal allele of a gene Necdin located in the Prader-Willi region. Such mice die shortly after birth due to respiratory problems and have mimicked one aspect of Prader-Willi syndrome. Their respiratory physiology is being studied in greater detail to determine the function of Necdin. We are also analyzing the function of another rclosely linked gene to Necdin, Magel2 , that is also expressed from the paternal allele in certain ket appetite regulatory areas in the brain. Overall, a molecular analysis of imprinting will provide insights into the epigenetic control of gene expression, an aspect that is of increasing relevance to understanding the inactivation of certain tumor suppressor genes in cancer formation.',\n",
       " 'Live-attenuated SIV strains provide an important model to study cellular and viral determinants that contribute to disease development and they also provide a unique tool to study mechanisms leading to protective immunity. We study the regulated expression of HIV which is mediated via the viral Rev protein with the goal to evaluate the role of Rev in pathogenesis. Our discovery of other RNA export mechanisms (mediate via cellular RNA export factors and retrovial RNA export elements CTE, RTE) provided the key tools to generate HIV and SIV variants that have the Rev RRE regulatory system replaced. CTE or RTE provide us also with useful tools to achieve efficient expression of HIV and SIV structural protein in simple DNA vectors used as vaccine approaches against AIDS. Importantly, we found that our Rev-independent SIV strains are not pathogenic in rhesus macaques, which demonstrates that the Rev regulation plays an important role in pathogenicity of SIV. Replacement of the natural regulatory controls of Rev-RRE by the CTE provides a novel approach to lower the virulence of a pathogenic lentivirus. These studies provide critical information about the establishment and maintenance of host immune responses during chronic retroviral infections with distinct pathogenic outcomes. Macaques immunized with attenuated viruses develop persistent humoral and cellular immune responses, able to protect the animals from highly pathogenic SIV challenge. Therefore, these live-attenuated SIV strains provide us not only with a unique tool to dissect cellular and viral determinants that contribute to AIDS development, but are also useful for studying correlates of protective immunity. These studies will provide critical information about the establishment and maintenance of host immune responses during chronic retroviral infections with distinct pathogenic outcomes.To study prevention of AIDS, we have a long-standing collaboration with George Pavlakis (Human Retrovirus Section, Vaccine Branch), and we have generated efficient DNA expression vectors, which are currently evaluated as vaccines against SIV and HIV. This work is based on the previous recognition that RNA elements (called INS) present within the gag pol and env coding regions of HIV are responsible for nuclear retention and instability of the transcripts in the absence of Rev, and that these elements can be eliminated by changing the RNA composition without affecting the amino acid sequence. These RNA optimized gag and env expression vectors mediate the development of protective immune responses in vaccinated macaques when used as DNA only as well as DNA prime vaccine modality. We also found that a combination of DNA vaccine vectors producing native and modified antigens are able to induce immune responses able to protect from high viremia in the rhesus macaque SIVmac251 model. On-going studies focus on evaluating the efficacy of these further optimized DNA based vaccine vectors both as preventive and therapeutic vaccine modalities.',\n",
       " 'Embryo implantation is a critical step in mammalian reproduction. At this point the embryo forms a more intimate connection with the maternal uterine tissues. In many mammals this involves physical attachment of the embryo to the uterus with subsequent invasion of the maternal tissues by the embryonic trophoblast. The uterus responds to the invading embryo by decidualizing which acts to both restrict embryo invasion and to nurture the implanted embryo. In anticipation of implantation the uterus undergoes a series of proliferative and differentiative changes under control of the ovarian steroid hormones, estrogen and progesterone that act either directly on cells or via the induction of locally produced growth factors and cytokines. Among the latter is Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) that we first showed inhibited the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. In mice and other mammals, including humans, LIF is strongly expressed in the uterus at the time of implantation and that in mice this is under the control of estrogen. LIF is essential for embryo implantation, as female mice lacking a functional LIF gene are sterile with the blastocysts failing to implant. We are currently investigating how LIF affects uterine receptivity, what signal transduction pathways are activated and how these are regulated by the steroid hormones. We are also interested in identifying genes that are controlled by LIF in the uterus and are developing tissues specific means by which we can manipulate their expression to determine their function. These studies should help understand some of the major causes of infertility. They may also provide insights as to how epithelial-stromal interactions are mediated by steroid hormones and growth factors. The latter should help understand how and why many cancers arise from epithelial cell populations in the body.',\n",
       " 'The vertebrate nuclear lamina is a protein meshwork associated with the nuclear face of the inner nuclear membrane (INM). It provides anchoring sites for chromatin domains, and is an important determinant of interphase nuclear architecture, DNA replication and chromatin organization. The major components of the lamina are the intermediate filament-like proteins, the nuclear lamins, The lamins are grouped into 2 classes, A-type and B-type. The B-type lamins are encoded by 2 genes and are constitutively expressed whereas the A-type lamins are spliced variants from a single gene (Lmna) and their expression is developmentally regulated. They are not expressed in early embryos or adult stem cell and their expression correlates with the terminal differentiation of various lineages. We derived mice that did not express the A-type lamins. Development of the Lamin null mice was overtly normal, but by 4-5 weeks they developed a severe form of muscular dystrophy, had abnormal hearts and were dead by 8 weeks. In humans different mutations in the Lamin A gene are responsible for at least 8 inherited diseases. These include 2 forms of muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, 2 types of Familial Partial Lipodystrohy, one of which also affects skeletal development, a peripheral neuropathy and most recently, the premature ageing condition called Hutchinson Gilford Progeria. We have derived mice with mutations in the Lmna gene that correspond to most of these diseases. We have produced mouse lines that develop muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and a progeric phenotype. The mice with progeria are providing novel insights into fundamental aspects of aging and how the structure of the nucleus developmentally regulates cell proliferation. The analysis of the laminopathies is providing novel insights into how the structure of the nucleus is important to its function. This is particularly relevant, as in addition to the diseases associated with the lamins (the laminopathies), at least 2 other disease have been linked to mutations in proteins associated with the nuclear envelope. Furthermore, a recent proteomics analysis of the components of the nuclear envelope suggested that an additional 14 diseases might also be linked to altered nuclear envelope proteins. In addition to these diseases we are also looking at what effects Lamin deficiency has on a cells ability to replicate its DNA, chromosome segregation location and chromatin organization gene regulation and whether lamin loss may affect tumor development.',\n",

We have completed the functional dynamics study of the L11-RNA-thiostrepton system, but decided not to pursue the structural determination of the ternary complex of L11-rRNA-thiostrepton as I have originally planed, because the result of our dynamics study appears to suggest that the structures of the ternary and the binary (L11-rRNA) complexes are similar. The results of the functional dynamics study has been written in a manuscript that was submitted to Journal of Molecular Biology. (2). We have nearly completed the \"3P\" (periodicity, Planarity and pixels) method development, and are in the process to program it in C++ in order to interface with the world-wide popular XPLOR-NIH package. The \"3P\" method was born out of a need to find a better way to determine structures like RAP that consists of periodical structural elements, and represents a significant departure from the traditional way of determining the structure using NMR data. One of the \"3P\" articles was selected for the cover page of Journal of Magnetic Resonance. A manuscript, the final installment of the \"3P\" project, has been written for a submission after the completion of the re-coding into C+++. This methodology development has facilitated our structural biology study of RAP, and will be useful for projects of structure determination in the future.The structural biology study of RAP and its interaction with the LRP receptor is an example of my vision as how a structural biology study should be conducted. This study tackled a difficult structural problem with a persistent effort, was aimed at the answering a fundamental biological question and was carried out with multiple collaborations. This project led to the discovery of a novel histidine switch that mediates the release of the LRP receptor in acidic environment in the Golgi, an important process involved in the receptor maturation. The mutants that we have made during the course of the study have potential therapeutic applications in treatment of diseases involved with the LRP receptor. We will apply for a US patent in the near future. The discovery of the histidine switch in RAP, a chaperone protein, trail blazes a new way to sequester the LRP receptor, and potentially other receptors, including LRP5 and LRP6 of the same family. Correct folding of LRP5 6 requires yet another specialized chaperone MESD. MESD can also be engineered to sequester LRP5 6 in the way similar to the mutated RAP to LRP, and this hypothesis sets a starting point to study the structural biology of the Wnt beta-catenin signaling pathway. Looking into the future, to fulfill the research goal, I have setup several key collaborations with intramural and extramural groups. Among those, we plan to crystallize receptors or receptor fragments, whenever approiate, in collaboration with Dr. Ji\\'s group; we plan to work with Dr. Shaprio\\'s group to develop a new method for structure determination of large protein receptors and RNAmolecules; we plan to study the kinetic and thermodynamics in vitro of the interaction between the chaperones and the receptors in collaboration with Dr. Smith-Gill\\'s group. We will continue our on-going collaboration with Professor Dudley Strickland group in the receptor biochemistry and biology.',\n",
       " 'The Genome Recombination Regulation Section focuses on three topics: functions that control the stability of genomes, functions that control aspects of gene expression, and the development of a yeast based system to study HIV-1. Studies on genome instability. This year, we continued our analysis of how DNA palindromes are generated. These head to head sequences are highly unstable sequences. Some tumor cells undergo gene amplification by unknown mechanisms that generate palindromes. The instability of these sequences contributes to the genome rearrangements that occur in tumors. Because palindromes are unstable in bacteria, it is it nearly impossible to clone them. Similarly, the secondary structures that can be adopted by palindromic DNAs make them very difficult to sequence. Last year, we made progress in three important areas related to the study of palindromes. First, we identified yeast strains that tolerate palindromes. Second, we developed a method that allows us to sequence palindromic DNAs. Third, we developed a recombination substrate that generates palindromes and identified a class of recombinants that is almost exclusively palindromes. This breakthrough allowed us to identify recombination functions that are required for the production palindromes. This year, we demonstrated that the palindromes are formed in our system by a novel kind of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) which is independent of some of the recombination functions that are required for most NHEJ events. We recently demonstrated that we can plan isolate palindromic sequences from mammalian genomes, opening the door to the analysis of palindromes found in normal and malignant cells.Studies on gene expression. We are developing methods to monitor the fidelity of transcription and the functions that contribute to the accuracy of that process. One such method involves monitoring the fidelity of retrotransposition. We have isolated mutations in a subunit of RNA polymerase that reduce the fidelity of retrotransposition and have demonstrated that they directly affect the accuracy of transcription. These are the first eukaryotic mutations known to reduce the fidelity of transcription. We also developed a screen for RNA polymerase mutants that increase the frequency of slippage during transcription. This class of transcription error has been shown to occur in bacteria and humans, but the features that avoid such errors have not been determined. We have also isolated the first mutations that increase errors of this type. We are investigating the biological consequences of increased transcription error rates. HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase. Several years ago, we developed hybrid Ty HIV-1 elements (HART) that have HIV-1 RT substituted for the Ty1 RT. These elements replicate in yeast and are dependent on the polymerase and RNase activities of HIV-1 RT. Replication of the HART elements is sensitive to the non-nucleoside class of HIV-1 RT inhibitors (NNRTI) while HART elements containing HIV-1 RT domains from resistant viruses are themselves resistant. This year, we used HART elements to detect RT domains that confer resistant to efavirenz among the viral sequences recovered from patient blood. These studies allowed increased sensitivity in studies that monitor the persistence of NNRTI resistant viruses in patients that have been treated with single doses of nevirapine. In addition to detecting very low levels of well known NNRTI resistant variants, we have been able to detect novel variants with moderate levels of NNRTI resistance which may have a role in the evolution of resistant HIV.',\n",
       " '<B>Research< b>:<BR><BR>The Developmental Genetics Section is mainly interested in the genetics and molecular biology of gene silencing and mating-type switching in <I>Schizosaccharomyces pombe< i>. In this yeast, the mating-type region consists of three loci called <I>mat1< i>, <I>mat2< i>, and <I>mat3< i>. The <I>mat2< i> and <I>mat3< i> loci are always silent and only act as donors of genetic information required for switching the transcriptionally active <I>mat1< i> locus.<BR><BR><B>Studies on Silencing< b><BR><BR>We previously found that silencing mechanism involves a chromosomally heritable epigenetic alteration, presumably of chromatin associated with the <I>mat< i> region. In fission yeast, an epigenetic imprint marking the mating-type (<I>mat2 3< i>) region contributes to inheritance of the silenced state, but the nature of the imprint is not known. We show that a chromodomain-containing swi6 protein is a dosage-critical component involved in imprinting the <I>mat< i> locus. The establishment and maintenance of the imprint are tightly coupled to the recruitment and the persistence of swi6 at the <I>mat2 3< i> region during mitosis as well as meiosis. Remarkably, swi6p remains bound to the <I>mat2 3< i> interval throughout the cell and itself seems to be a component of the imprint. Our analyses suggest that the unit of inheritance at the <I>mat2 3< i> locus comprises the DNA plus the associated swi6 protein complex. Interestingly the silenced domain is bracketed by 1.2KB inverted repeat sequences that block spreading of heterochromatin to adjoining regions of chromosome. We have discovered that mutations in deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis cause spreading of silencing across these heterochromatin barriers. The spreading of heterochromatin across barriers required functional Atf1 Pcr1, ATF-CREB family proteins, but not the RNA-interference Dcr1, Ago1, or Rdp1 factors, previously implicated in silencing. Our work on will continues to define the genetic determinants of silencing. This work has direct implication for explaining eucaryotic cellular differentiation and for cancer development as disruption of epigenetic controls constitutes a prominant mechanism of unwanted cellular growth.',\n",

       " 'The pattern of switching of <I>S. pombe< i> cells is nonrandom when assayed by single cell pedigrees. After two consecutive asymmetric cell divisions, one in four \"granddaughter\" cells undergoes a mating-type switch. Previously, we showed that this pattern is due to <I>mat1< i> imprinting that marks only one sister chromatid in a strand-specific manner, and that is related to site-specific, double-stranded DNA break at <I>mat1< i>. We now show that the imprint is a strand-specific, alkali-labile DNA modification at <I>mat1< i>.<BR><BR>The DNA break is an artifact, created from the imprint during DNA purification. We also proposed and tested the model that <I>mat1< i> is preferentially replicated by a centromere-distal origin(s), so that the strand-specific imprint occurs only during lagging-strand synthesis. Altering the origin of replication, by inverting <I>mat1< i> or introducing an origin of replication, affects the imprinting and switching efficiencies in predicted ways. Two-dimensional gel analysis confirmed that <I>mat1< i> is preferentially replicated by a centromere-distal origin(s). Thus, the DNA replication machinery may confer different developmental potential to sister cells.<BR><BR> Our recent work has discovered biochemical functions of <I>swi1< i> and <I>swi3< i> genes. We found that swi1p and swi3p perform imprinting by pausing and termination of DNA replication at <I>mat1< i>. Our work shows (1) that the factors swi1p and swi3p act by pausing the replication fork at the imprinting site; and (2) that swi1p and swi3p are involved in termination at the <I>mat1< i>-proximal polar-terminator of replication (<I>RTS1< i>). A genetic screen to identify termination factors identified an allele that separated pausing imprinting and termination of functions of swi1p. The results suggest that swi1p and swi3p promote imprinting in novel ways both by pausing replication at <I>mat1< i> and by terminating replication at <I>RTS1< i>. We also showed that Swi1 and Swi3 proteins form a complex in vivo and both bind to the RTS1 and the mat1 replication pause sites on the chromosome. Future studies are designed to define the mechanism of imprinting.',\n",
       " 'Ninety-seven per cent of right-handed (RH) individuals develop speech and language processing in the left (dominant) hemisphere of the brain, while the \"minor\" hemisphere controls emotional behavior. However, this correlation fails in LH (left-handed) individuals; 70% are left-brain dominant and 30% are right-brain dominant. The reason for this complex correlation of handedness with brain lateralization has been the key unanswered question for brain development. We have speculated that a hypothetical gene, RGHT, functions to specify left-brain dominance resulting in developing the right-handed preference. To test these ideas experimentally, we have been collecting blood samples and cheek swabs from specific families with the aim to genetically map the hypothesized RGHT gene. We have collected enough samples and the next stage is to use these samples for mapping by the sib-pair method. We have published our random recessive model in which individuals with the nonfunctional recessive allele on both homologs have a 50:50 chance of either being RH or LH. Recently, we found interesting association of hand use preference with the clockwise vs. counterclockwise scalp hair-whorl rotation. We suggest that individuals with the right gene are RH and develop clockwise hair whorls, but individuals with the recessive allele are 50:50 in hair whorl orientation.',\n",
       " \"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes play an important role in the development of early-onset familial breast cancer. Our goal is to carry out functional dissection of these genes using a mouse model system. Since complete loss of function mutations result in embryonic lethality, we are engaged in generating an array of specific mutations along the length of proteins encoded by these genes. To accomplish this, we have developed a transgenic mouse model system that combines the use of existing Brca1 and Brca2knockout mice and the use of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) containing these genes. Desired mutations can be generated in the Brca1 or Brca2 gene in the BAC and the phenotypic effect of the mutation can be analyzed in transgenic mice that are homozygous mutant for that gene. In a continuing effort to understand the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in various biological processes, we have developed humanized mouse models for functional analysis of human BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. We have shown that wild-type human BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes under the control of their own promoter present in BAC clones are fully functional in mice and can rescue the lethality associated with loss of function mutations of the respective genes in mice. The humanized mouse models provide an experimentally tractable system to generate mutations identified in human breast cancer patients and analyze how they result in tumorigenesis.We have developed a simple but powerful method to generate subtle alterations in the BACs by using recombineering in bacteria. This method is based on the generation of recombinants in the BAC DNA by using oligonucleotides as targeting vectors with as few as 70 bases of homology. We have demonstrated that this technique can be used to generate single base changes, small insertions and deletions. Due to the high efficiency of recombineering, recombinant clones can be identified by a simple PCR based screening method without the use of any selectable marker. We have used this method to generate several cancer causing missense mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the BAC and are examining their phenotypic consequences in mice in a Brca1 or Brca2 mutant background. Based on the expression of BRCA2 on meiotic chromosomes, it has been predicted to be required for normal meiotic progression. Since Brca2 null mutants are embryonic lethal, its precise function in meiosis is unknown. We have generated a mouse model to describe a role for BRCA2 in meiosis. These mice lack the endogenous Brca2 gene but lethality is rescued by a human BRCA2 transgene. However, these mice are sterile due to poor expression of the transgene in testes and ovaries. We have used these mice to describe a role for BRCA2 in meiosis that is sexually dimorphic. We have found that the BRCA2-deficient spermatocytes undergo apoptosis unlike the BRCA2-deficient breast and ovarian epithelial cells that undergo neoplastic growth. This suggests that the cellular response to DNA damage may be tissue specific, which may explain why mutations in this widely expressed gene do not result in cancer in all tissues. A mutation in an evolutionarily conserved domain of BRCA2 has revealed a novel function for the protein in alkyl-DNA repair. Mutant mice develop normally but embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice are extremely sensitive to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine (MNNG), an alkylating agent, which results in the conversion of guanines to O6-methylguanines. The major pathway of repair of this methylated guanine involves removal of a methyl group by the O6-methylguanine-methyl transferase (MGMT) enzyme. Our current research is focused on understanding the interaction between BRCA2 and MGMT function as it may open new avenues for breast cancer therapy.\",\n",
       " \"Function of kinase-deficient Trk receptor isoforms. TrkB and TrkC encode a number of isoforms, including those that lack the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain. Little is known about the function of these kinase deficient isoforms in Trk signaling. In vitro studies, and our own in vivo studies, have shown that truncated Trk receptors can inhibit the function of kinase-active receptor isoforms in a dominant-negative manner or by ligand sequestration. The physiological relevance of this activity is, however, still unclear. The high degree of sequence conservation of the intracellular domains of truncated receptors suggests the potential for specific interactions with cytoplasmic proteins and signaling capabilities. Indeed, it has been reported recently that BDNF induces the production of calcium waves in astroglia through the truncated TrkB T1 receptor. However, the molecular mechanism(s) linking the TrkB T1 receptor to calcium mobilization and its physiological role is still unknown. Interestingly, TrkB T1 is 50% overexpressed in the brain of the trisomy 16 (Ts16) mouse model of Down syndrome and Ts16 hippocampal neurons die prematurely in culture. Neurodegeneration is commonly associated with Down syndrome in humans and TrkB T1 is also overexpressed in Alzheimer's patients. To further investigate the role of TrkB T1 in neuronal survival, we generated a mouse lacking specifically the TrkBT1 kinase-deficient receptor isoform. This mutation caused no gross phenotype and could be used to correct the levels of TrkB T1 in Ts16 mice in vivo. Importantly, hippocampal neurons from TrkB T1 - +; Ts16 mice escaped the premature cell death of Ts16 neurons in vitro (Dorsey et al. in preparation). This is a very exciting result because it contrasts with earlier hypotheses that neurodegeneration occurs due to insufficient supply of neurotrophic factors. Rather, our studies suggest that modulation of cell death and survival can occur at the level of the Trk receptor. We are now investigating the molecular mechanism underlying the detrimental effect of elevated TrkB T1 expression. Specifically, we are addressing both the effects of TrkBT1 on the activity of the full-length TrkB receptor and on the intracellular regulation of Ca++ levels. In this regard we have further investigated the role of truncated TrkB.T1 in vivo under physiological conditions. We found a gain-of function phenotype in TrkB.T1- - mice both in an in vivo assay of gross neuromuscular function (e.g. increased forepaw grip strength) as well as in a direct assessment of nerve evoked muscle performance. The enhancement in performance could not be explained by alterations in muscle fiber plasticity or synaptic function. Instead, we found that one mechanism underlying this phenotype is increased muscle specific contractility and calcium signaling. These novel post-synaptic findings suggest that physiological TrkB.T1 acts to delimit muscle contractility with contributions from a pathway involving Ca2+ signaling. Truncated TrkC receptors, such as TrkC TK-, have never been implicated in intracellular signaling. To identify proteins that might bind the highly conserved intracellular domain of TrkC TK-, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified an adaptor protein (GRASP tamalin) that interacts specifically with TrkC TK- in a ligand dependent manner. Both tamalin and TrkC TK- are expressed in the brain with overlapping anatomical and subcellular distribution. We also found that NT-3 initiation of the TrkCTK- Tamalin complex leads to activation of Rac1 GTPase through the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6). NT-3 binding to TrkCTK- Tamalin induces ARF6 translocation to the membrane, which in turn causes membrane ruffling and formation of cellular protrusions. Thus, we have shown that a truncated TrkC receptor lacking kinase activity can activate a specific intracellular signaling pathway that links NT-3 to key components of neuronal development and plasticity, such as regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. Moreover, we have established NT-3 as an unsuspected upstream activator of ARF6, a regulator of endosome membrane trafficking, endocytosis and actin remodeling at the cell surface; processes that are important for cell motility. To further investigate the function of tamalin in the nervous system, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of tamalin. These mice are viable and are currently under investigation. Our studies showing that TrkC TK- can affect cell motility raise an important question concerning the role of Trk receptors in tumors. While expression of Trk receptors has been found in many tumor types (e.g. neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, etc.), it has been difficult to explain how expression of one receptor in some tumors is associated with a favorable outcome (e.g. TrkC expression in medulloblastoma or neuroblastoma) while in other tumors it is linked to a negative prognosis (e.g. TrkC expression in pancreatic carcinoma). Virtually no attention has been paid to which specific Trk receptor isoforms (kinase active or deficient) are expressed in these tumors and whether they confer specific biological properties to neoplastic growth. Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that expression of truncated receptors alone or in association with the tyrosine kinase isoforms may account for some of these tumor growth characteristics. Thus, we plan to determine whether there is differential expression of Trk receptor isoforms among established tumor cell lines. We also want to determine whether modulating the expression of specific receptor isoforms can influence the proliferative and metastatic potential of tumor cells. Lastly, In collaboration with Dr. Italo Mocchetti (Georgetown University) we showed that BDNF prevents the nigrostriatal degeneration induced by human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) glycoprotein 120 in vivo, since BDNF deficiency in mice causes upregulation of the gp120 receptor, CXCR4. These data suggest that down-regulation of CXCR4 expression may contribute to the neuroprotective activity of BDNF against gp120 toxicity in the basal ganglia and shed light on a possible therapeutic use of BDNF signaling against HIV-induced neurotoxicity. Our mouse models should provide useful tools to test these hypothesis. Taken together, our findings suggest that truncated Trk receptors affect signaling involved in cell survival, vesicular transport and cell motility. These are all key cell biological processes that are altered in pathological conditions. Thus, we plan to continue our dissection of truncated Trk receptor activities in vitro and further extend our analysis in vivo by using the conditional mouse models we have generated.\",\n",
       " 'In the attempt to generate a suitable animal model we have taken a novel approach of \"reverse conditional gene targeting\", in which TrkA is deleted only in non-neuronal cells (Coppola et al.. 2004) With this mutation we could show that the NGF receptor TrkA is not required for development of the immune system. However, TrkA deficiency causes defects associated with a specific class of B lymphocytes and immunoglobulin production as well as degranulation defects in mast cells. Thus, TrkA, appears to modulate functions of the immune system rather than its development. This was a striking result since many studies suggested that disruption of the NGF TrkA system in the immune system would cause dramatic deficits. Currently, we are in the process of performing more functional studies in vivo using this reverse conditional TrkA mutant mouse model. Having validated the use of this new reverse conditional strategy to specifically restore a gene function in a specific organ, we have now generated a similar mouse mutant for the TrkB gene. Analysis of this mutant is underway. These experiments should help elucidate the function of Trk genes in the non-neuronal compartments.',\n",
       " 'We are using inbred mouse strains that develop high spontaneous incidences of retrovirally induced leukemia as model systems for identifying new leukemia disease genes. The expectation is that some of these genes will also represent human disease genes that might not be easy to identify directly in humans. Once these genes are identified, we use gene knockout and transgenic mice, genetic criteria, and cell biological approaches to understand how these genes function in disease induction, to place these genes into different biochemical pathways, and to develop new mouse models for human leukemia. The BXH2 and AKXD recombinant inbred strains have been particularly valuable for this research because they develop high incidences of myeloid or B- and T-cell leukemia, respectively, and the proviral integration sites in these leukemias provide powerful genetic tags for disease gene identification. Insertional mutagenesis studies performed in ours and other laboratories have identified more than 250 candidate cancer gene loci. Several of these loci encode validated human cancer genes, while many others encode novel genes that have not yet been examined for a role in human or mouse disease. These are the most interesting since they represent potential novel new human cancer genes. Many of these genes function in pathways already associated with hematopoietic disease, while others may identify pathways not yet associated with hematopoietic disease. In many tumors more than one disease gene was identified by insertional mutagenesis. These genes are likely to represent cooperating partners in disease. Finally, several genes identified by insertional mutagenesis have been shown to function as key regulators of normal hematopoiesis. Insertional mutagenesis therefore also provides a way to identify new regulators of hematopoiesis.',\n",
       " 'Phage-based Escherichia coli homologous recombination systems have recently been developed that now make it possible to subclone or modify DNA cloned into plasmids, BACs or PACs without the need for restriction enzymes or DNA ligases. This new form of chromosome engineering, termed recombineering, has many uses for functional genomics, including generating transgenic and knockout targeting vectors, and for identifying long-range regulatory elements and functional domains in genes. During the past year we described a new recombineering-based method for generating conditional mouse knockout (cko) mutations that uses gap repair to subclone DNA from BACs into high copy plasmids, and homologous recombination, and Cre or Flpe recombinases, to introduce loxP or FRT sites into the subcloned DNA. Unlike previous methods that use short 45-55 bp regions of homology for recombineering, our method uses much longer regions of homology. We also made use of several new E. coli strains, in which the proteins required for recombination are expressed from a defective temperature-sensitive lambda prophage, and Cre or Flpe recombinases from an arabinose inducible promoter. We also described two new Neo selection cassettes that work well in both E. coli and mouse ES cells. Our method is fast, efficient, and reliable and makes it possible to generate cko-targeting vectors in less than two weeks. In addition, it should facilitate the generation of knock-in mutations and transgene constructs, as well as expedite the analysis of regulatory elements and functional domains in or near genes.',\n",
       " 'Several years ago we showed that the spontaneous mouse mutation dilute (d) was caused by the integration of a retrovirus into the mouse genome. This observation was very exciting because it was the first demonstration of a retrovirus-induced mutation in mammals. dilute mice make normal amounts of pigment but the melanosomes, the pigment-containing vesicles in the melanocyte, are inefficiently transported from the perinuclear region of cell to the dendritic tips. This results in an uneven release of pigment and a dilution of coat color. Subsequently, we showed that d encodes an actin-based molecular motor, MYO5A. Yeast two hybrid studies suggested that MYOVA functions as part of a complex with a microtubule-based motor, KIF5B. This was the first evidence for an integrated motor complex that can move on both microtubule and actin tracks and we are now testing this hypothesis by generating mice lacking KIF5B in melanocytes. We used positional cloning to identify the products of ashen (ash) and leaden (ln), two mutations that phenocopy dilute. In subsequent collaborative studies we showed that the ash, which encodes RAB27A, and the ln, which encodes a RAB effector designated Melanophilin (MLPH), proteins form a complex on the melanosome that functions as the receptor for MYOVA. This was the first molecular description of a receptor for a molecular motor on a vesicle in mammals. Importantly, all three proteins are mutated in human disease. All patients with Griscelli Syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, display hypopigmentation of the skin and hair. Some also show neurological impairment of varying severity, which correlates with mutations in MYO5A; others show immune dysfunction in addition to hypopigmentation and these phenotypes correlate with mutations in RAB27A. Mice carrying various alleles of dilute, which can also display neurological abnormalities, and of ashen, which also display immune abnormalities, are now excellent models for the further study of these human diseases. Patients with mutations in MLPH display only a hypopigmentation phenotype, consistent with the observation that no other phenotypes are detected in mice homozygous for the ln mutation. In studies that have not yet been submitted for publication we succeeded in positionally cloning dilute suppressor (dsu), the first unlinked suppressor mutation to be identified in mammals. dsu is a semidominant suppressor that rescues, at least partially, the coat color dilution of d, ash, and ln mice. Contrary to our expectations, dsu does not encode a motor protein, or a protein (i.e. a transcription factor) that could regulate a motor protein and substitute for the loss of MYO5A. Instead, we found that dsu encodes a small protein with no striking functional motifs. dsu may therefore represent the founding member of a new pathway that regulates directional vesicle transport. We also uncovered surprising effects of dsu, d, ash, and ln in the eye, a subject of future studies.In collaborative studies, we positionally cloned ruby eye-2 (ru2) and ruby-eye (ru), two other pigment diluting mutations that are partially suppressed by dsu. We showed that the proteins encoded by ru2 and ru form a protein complex and are mutated in human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) type 5 and 6 patients, respectively. HPS is a multigenic disorder that affects melanocytes, platelets, and lysosomes, organelles that share a common biosynthetic pathway. Very recently, collaborative studies revealed that the gene encoded by the sandy pigment diluting mutation is mutated in HPS type 7 patients. Again, mice carrying these various diluting mutations are very important models for further studying human disease.',\n",
       " 'This project aims to characterize virus-cell interactions leading to AIDS pathogenesis at the cellular and molecular level; to identify important virus reservoirs and sanctuaries that result in persistent virus infection; and to characterize HIV interactions with cells of the innate immune system. Identification of all cell types persistently infected by HIV is of profound importance for the understanding of AIDS pathogenesis and for the development of better treatment regimens. We have identified a subset of CD56+CD3- natural killer (NK) cells in healthy donors that express CD4 and the HIV coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4. These cells are expanded in the peripheral blood of some HIV infected individuals and can be productively infected by both CCR5 and CXCR4-restricted molecular clones of HIV-1 in a CD4-dependent manner. Direct infection of these important innate immune cells by HIV may be relevant for the defects in innate immunity observed in AIDS patients. The role of cytokines in HIV propagation in primary cells and tissues has been studied further. HIV coreceptor regulation and intracellular mechanisms are important controls for virus propagation. Cytokine regulation of HIV coreceptor expression is cell type specific. The exact function(s) of Vpr, a 96-amino-acid virion-associated protein shown to be important for virus replication propagation in vivo have not reached a consensus. Vpr shows multiple activities such as participation in the nuclear translocation of the HIV-1-preintegration complex, transcriptional regulation of both the HIV-1 long terminal repeat and of cellular genes, cell cycle arrest at the G2 M boundary of cell cycle, and possibly apoptosis. We have found that Vpr interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, a family regulating subcellular localization of many proteins in the cell. 14-3-3 proteins regulate the G2 M transition by inactivating Cdc25C phosphatase. Our results indicate that Vpr promotes cell cycle arrest at the G2 M phase by facilitating association of 14-3-3 and Cdc25C.',\n",
       " 'DNA-protein biding often results in global changes in the DNA topology, such as bending or kinking. For DNA to bend, there needs to be adjustments in the structural units that define the duplex conformation. The overall DNA conformation is defined by many factors, one of which is the \"pucker\" preference of the ribose ring. While the furanose ring of a simple nucleotide is in dynamic equilibrium between a South (S) sugar pucker (2\\'-endo, B DNA-like) and a North (N) sugar pucker (3\\'-endo, A DNA RNA-like), upon incorporation into a DNA strand, the furanose ring adopts a preferred conformation. In a typical B-like DNA duplex, the base pairs involved in a topological adjustment such as a bend assume an altered, more A-like (N) sugar pucker. Prearrangement of the DNA duplex to more closely resemble the bound state (\"bent\" conformation) may increase the binding affinity or decrease the disassociation energy from a protein of interest. As outlined in project Z01 BC 006174, the preparation of unique synthetic nucleotide analogues based on a bicyclo 3.1.0 hexane template system has been refined and the conformation of the monomers studied. This modified scaffold can lock the sugar pucker in either an N or S conformation depending on the relative position of the base on the 3.1.0 scaffold. Modified N- thymidine and N-adenine nucleotides were inserted into the Dickerson Drew dodecamer (5\\'-CGCGAATTCGCG-3\\'), a prototypical B-type DNA. Biophysical data obtained through circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry, and NMR have provided evidence for the effects that the modified sugar unit(s) had on the DNA structure. In the last annual report, we had stated that both NMR chemical shift assignments and comprehensive thermodynamic and CD data for the oligomers where the thymidines were replaced by a locked N analogue were complete. We have also analyzed the residual dipolar coupling (RDC) in the context of a new procedure to rapidly assess bending in an oligomer where a high resolution structure is already known. Our NMR studies at 800 MHz clarified our original data and were then used in the analysis of the bending of the three T-substituted oligonucleotides. We showed that bending of the duplex progressively increases with the number and position of the substituted residues. This technique has the potential to define DNA bending by comparing data of residues that are not affected by the substitution. This will dramatically shorten the analysis time for the resolution of global changes of substituted DNA oligomers. In addition, we have examined the corresponding adenine-substituted oligomers by CD and NMR spectroscopies. Initial data suggest that these oligomers actually are stabilized relative to the native dodecamer. This would be consistent with the idea that preorganization of the nucleotides into a B-like (2\\'-endo) conformation would more efficiently facilitate assembly of the duplex. Along with assistant professor Justin Wu at the Ohio State University, we are starting to fully characterize the global folds of the substituted oligomers through the analysis of a full list of RDCs. We are currently devising a new synthetic procedure to prepare the locked N and S building blocks with specific 13C labeling for enhanced sensitivity in the NMR experiments.',\n",
       " 'Research at the DNA replication group aims at understanding how information from the cell cycle machinery leads to the initiation of DNA replication. Proper cell growth depends on a network of interacting molecules that prevents DNA replication and cell division under unfavorable conditions. Disruptions in the intricate balance between components of this network may lead to cancer; however, interfering with signals transmitted by the cell cycle signaling network is an important tool for cancer therapy. A better understanding of the cell cycle is fundamental to the development of rational, knowledge-based strategies to combat cancer and utilize stem cells to improve human health. To study cell cycle signaling at the chromatin level, we specify DNA sequences that determine whether, where, and when replication will occur. DNA sequences that determine the location of replication initiation are called replicators. Replicators are identified by their ability to start replication when transferred from their original genomic locus to ectopic genomic sites [1]. Genetic dissection of replicators (for details, see Specific Aim 1) allows us to delineate the sequence requirements for starting DNA replication. We had also reported (Specific Aim 2) that the timing of DNA replication during the S-phase of the cell cycle can be altered [2]. We now use the ability to alter replication timing as a tool to elucidate genetic and epigenetic factors that determine replication timing. We have recently started to use single molecule analyses of DNA replication to evaluate the effect of changes in metabolic conditions and exposure to anti-cancer drugs on initiation patterns [3] (Specific Aim 3). The studies outlined provide insights into the interactions of the cell cycle machinery with chromatin to control DNA replication during normal growth and in response to replication-perturbing drugs. Below is a summary of recent findings, summarized briefly for each specific aim. 1. Characterization of replicators, genetic elements that affect the location of replication initiation. For this aim, we have established that the replication initiation region within the human _eta-globin locus contains two independent, non-overlapping replicators and have identified sequence motifs that are required for initiation of DNA replication within these replicators. [4] Although we have shown replicator sequences were not conserved during recent mammalian evolution [5], and that replication often requires interactions with distal sequences [6], replicators share common sequence features [7]. We reported that at the beta globin locus, those sequence motifs interact with each other to determine the location of replication initiation events, implying a modular structure for mammalian replicators [8]. Ongoing studies have begun to characterize proteins that bind critical sequences that affect the location of initiation events using a combination of biochemical techniques and genomic footprinting. 2. Analysis of the effect of DNA sequence and chromatin structure on replication timing. We have identified DNA sequences that affect the timing of DNA replication [2, 9] and have shown that the timing of DNA replication correlates with the status of chromatin condensation and with epigenetic factors, such as methylation of CpG sequences [10] and histone modifications [2, 11]. Tissue-specific patterns of replication timing can be conserved in evolution even in loci that do not conserve replication initiation patterns [5]. We have shown that functional replicator sequences (but not mutated replicators) prevented gene silencing and replication delay and prohibited chromatin condensation [11]. Ongoing studies have analyzed in detail the role of certain DNA sequences that affect chromatin condensation, termed insulators, on the timing of DNA replication. 3. Identification of cellular signalling interactions induced by the perturbation of DNA replication. We have started to investigate how cells respond to perturbation of DNA replication. We have shown that exposure to mild drug-induced perturbation of DNA replication, which is below the threshold of the cell cycle checkpoint response, can rapidly induce DNA breaks. In cells that contain an intact nonhomologous end-joining pathway, those DNA breaks are transient and cells rapidly resume replication in the presence of the inhibitor, albeit at a slow rate. However, DNA breaks persist in cells that are deficient in components of the pathway such as DNA-PK and XRCC4; such cells are unable to resume DNA replication and activate a cell cycle checkpoint response after a mild inhibition of DNA synthesis [3]. Ongoing studies determine the role of other DNA-modifying proteins in the cellular response to perturbed replication. Cited references: 1. Aladjem, M.I., Rodewald, L.W., Kolman, J.L., and Wahl, G.M.

       " 'Cells contain thousands of multimolecular complexes which work together much like miniature factory machines. A detailed understanding of the structure and function of these molecular devices is a problem of great interest in cell biology. Our research efforts focus on electron cryo-microscopic analysis of single particles, a powerful method to determine the three-dimensional architectures of complex cellular assemblies. We have defined and interpreted the structure of an icosahedral pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex, a prototypical example of a multi-step catalytic machine which couples the activity of three component enzymes (E1, E2, and E3) in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to generate acetyl CoA at the junction of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The three-dimensional model for a 11 MDa, icosahedral PDH complex, composed of 60 E2 enzymes and 60 E1 enzymes, was obtained by combining a 28 structure derived from electron cryo-microscopy with previously determined atomic coordinates of the individual components of the complex (Milne et al. EMBO J. 21, 5587, 2002). Analysis of the model provides a number of novel insights into the design and function of this molecular machine. A key feature is that the E1 molecules are located on the periphery in an orientation that allows each of the 60 mobile lipoyl domains tethered to the inner E2 enzyme to access multiple E1 active sites from inside the icosahedral complex. This unanticipated architecture provides a highly efficient mechanism for active site coupling and catalytic rate enhancement, which we propose is achieved by the motion of the lipoyl domain in the restricted annular region between the inner and outer cores of the complex. We are currently refining a second PDH complex comprised of 60 E2 enzymes and 60 E3 enzymes to determine the structural basis of why in vivo the inner icosahedron of 60 E2 molecules is occupied with only 48 E1 molecules and 6 E3 molecules to form the outer protein shell. Our three-dimensional reconstruction this complex indicates that, similar to the E1E2 complex described above, an annular gap of 75 exists between the inner core and the outer shell of E3 homodimers. Image analysis of partial occupancy complexes, formed by decorating the E2 core with 10, 20, 40 or 60 E1 tetramers or with 10, 20, 40 or 60 E3 homodimers, also indicates a 75-95 separation of the E2 and E1 or E2 and E3 densities. Thus, interactions occurring between the enzymes of the outer protein shell are not responsible for maintenance of the size of the complex. Rather, the E2 inner linkers that connect the E2 catalytic domains to the E2 peripheral-subunit binding domains must be fairly rigid radial spokes that provide a scaffold for an organization of E1 and E3 molecules. E3 localizes slightly closer to the core, suggesting that the swinging lipoyl domain can effectively access the active sites of all three enzymes, without leaving the annular space. This architecture provides further evidence of the highly efficient mechanism for active site coupling during both the production of acetyl CoA and the subsequent enzyme regeneration step that is required to initiate a new cycle of acetyl CoA production. We are also working actively to identify conditions that lead to outstanding microscopic images, to develop methods to select and accurately align the best molecular images for three-dimensional reconstructions, to reliably interpret these structures, and to develop automated procedures to facilitate the process of obtaining high quality three dimensional models of macromolecular complexes. To this end, we have 1) developed algorithms to collect data automatically on the Tecnai series of electron microscopes, 2) characterized the properties of a 4000 x 4000 pixel digital CCD camera, and assessed the quality of the three-dimensional molecular models constructed from CCD digital images, 3) developed a \"core-weighting\" method, combined with a grid-threading Monte Carlo approach to enhance the ability to reliably identify the best fit of atomic coordinates of individual components into low resolution maps of larger complexes that are typical of structures determined with the use of single particle electron microscopy and 4) optimized methods for the computational analysis of molecular images . We have demonstrated that the combination of iterative refinement and stringent molecular sorting can be an effective method to obtain substantial improvements in map quality of the 1.8 MDa icosahedral E2 catalytic core. From a starting set of 42,945 images of the core complex, we have shown that using only the best 139 particles in the data set produces a map that is superior to those constructed with greater numbers of images, and that many of the alpha-helices in the structure can be unambiguously visualized in a map constructed from as few as 9 particles. Thus, stringent computational sorting of molecular images may help overcome the significant limitations posed by heterogeneity in image quality and in protein conformation that are inherent to large data sets of images. Application of this method and improved fitting algorithms to facilitate accurate docking of X-ray coordinates of individual component proteins into the density maps obtained by cryo electron microscopy should enhance visualization of important macromolecular complexes present in normal and malignant cells.',\n",
       " '1). Genetic linkage studies mapped a locus for hereditary prostate cancer, HPCX, to the long arm of the X chromosome at Xq27. The candidate region contains two clusters of SPANX genes, a SPANX-A D subfamily including five members, SPANX-A1, SPANX-A2, SPANX-B, SPANX-C, and SPANX-D, and a SPANX-N subfamily including four members, SPANX-N1, SPANX-N2, SPANX-N3, and SPANX-N4, encoding cancer-testis specific antigens. Our previous analysis of the SPANX-B and SPANX-D loci identified several new DNA sequence variants resulted from gene conversion, though none of them was specific for X-linked families (Kouprina et al., 2005). During last fiscal year, we carried out mutational analysis of other SPANX genes (SPANX-A1, SPANX-A2, SPANX-C, SPANX-N1, SPANX-N2, SPANX-N3, and SPANX-N4) localized within the candidate region in the X-linked prostate cancer patients. Sequence analysis of the gene isolates did not reveal any alterations specific for the patients with hereditary prostate cancer. Thus, these and previous results indicate that either a specific combination of SPANX alleles or genomic rearrangements in the SPANX intergenic regions results in the predisposition to prostate cancer in X-linked families.2). Human artificial chromosomes (HACs) provide a unique opportunity to study kinetochore formation and to develop a new generation of vectors with potential in gene therapy. We constructed the first human artificial chromosome with a conditional centromere that can be inactivated by targeted modification of its epigenetic configuration in vivo. The HAC was built up using a DNA array based upon a synthetic alpha-satellite (alphoid) repeat containing one natural monomer, with a binding site for CENP-B (CENP-B box), and one completely synthetic monomer in which the region corresponding to the CENP-B box was replaced with a tetracycline operator (tetO). Binding of the tTA transcriptional transactivator dramatically destabilized the HAC, whilst expression of several other tetracycline-repression fusion proteins had no significant effect on HAC stability. The opportunity to selectively target different proteins into an active kinetochore and thereby regulate centromere function opens the way for an unprecedented mechanistic and structural analysis of the human kinetochore as well as for development of new HAC-based conditional gene expression systems.',\n",
       " 'Our research focuses on intrathymic T-cell development, which, as one of the few developmental programs that continue throughout life, is a privileged model to study cell death survival decisions in mammals. After they have rearranged their T-cell Receptor (TCR) genes, immature thymocytes initiate the process known as T-cell selection, in which their fate, i.e. death vs. differentiation and survival, depends on signals generated by their TCR upon engagement by self-MHC peptide ligands. Our objective is to identify the intracellular signaling and gene expression programs involved in T-cell selection. We have been taking three concurrent experimental approaches to address these issues. First, we have generated mouse models to interrupt TCR signaling in vivo at defined steps of T-cell development. These mouse models were developed by restricting the developmental window of expression of Zap70, a tyrosine kinase required for TCR signal transduction. Using these models, we have shown that the duration of TCR signaling controls CD4-CD8 lineage choice in vivo and we have defined the developmental window during which thymocytes remain open to lineage choice. We have found that, contrary to expectations, late stages of thymocyte development (i.e. after the completion of lineage differentiation but before exit from the thymus) remain dependent on TCR signaling and we are currently investigating the targets of TCR signaling in such late stage thymocytes. Our second approach used high-throughput gene expression analyses to identify genes potentially involved in differentiation and survival during intrathymic selection. We have identified over a hundred genes whose expression is affected by selection signals, including genes with potential \"regulatory\" activity such as transcription factors or membrane receptors. After more detailed expression analyses, we have selected two promising \"candidate\" genes for further studies (currently in progress) using transgenic and homologous recombination approaches. The third strategy we are pursuing uses conditionally active proteins to control signaling in cell populations in a synchronous way in vivo. This approach, which involves the development of proteins with ligand-controled activity, has the advantage over \"conventional\" gene targeting or transgenesis to allow analyses of dynamic responses to perturbations in cells or organisms. Compared to ligand (e.g. tetracycline)-regulated expression systems, conditionally active proteins offer greater time-resolution by by-passing the time lag required for de novo gene expression to achieve sufficient protein concentrations. We have generated a conditional version of Zap70, whose activity can be controlled by small diffusible ligands, and we have validated this approach using transient expression in cell lines. Using this strategy, we have shown that Zap70 has a dual role in TCR internalization: recruitment of Zap70 without kinase activation protects TCR complexes from internalization, whereas kinase activation promotes TCR internalization. We are currently characterizing mouse transgenic lines expressing conditional Zap70 proteins, in order to study signal transduction and gene expression in vivo during intrathymic development.',\n",
       " 'Dissecting the genetic susceptibility to complex human diseases is challenging, due to many constraints in humans, such as genetic heterogeneity, environmental factors, and sporadic occurrence. These constraints greatly diminish the power of modern human genetics tools to discern potential genetic link between diverse phenotypes (variability of disease severity, presentation, age of onset, etc.) to a single genetic locus. The situation is worsened when genetic alterations lie outside of the coding sequence. To overcome these constraints in human and to develop more effective strategy to enhance the resolution of discerning subtle genetic or epigenetic alterations as a mechanism for human disease susceptibility, a reverse population genetics approach, i.e., a population study in a cohort of mice with defined genetic alteration, was developed. The effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated by linking Gdnf locus to Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) susceptibility in a cohort of mice lacking one functioning Gdnf allele. The mutant cohort recapitulates characteristic features of the human disease. This novel model allows us to study the developmental mechanisms of disease pathogenesis that might be relevant to most HSCR patients. In a broader sense, our results establish a general paradigm for dissecting the genetic basis for human disease susceptibility in mice (Am. J. Human Genet.). Using the same population genetics approach, we extended the scope of phenotyping analyses to adult mice of their entire life span. Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its signaling pathway, GFRa1, the ligand binding receptor, and c-Ret, a receptor tyrosine kinase, play a critical role in kidney organ formation and enteric nervous system development. Homozygous mice missing any one component of signaling pathway (Gdnf- -, Gfra1- - or c-ret- -) die at birth due to bilateral renal agenesis and enteric total aganglionosis. While 8-20% of Gdnf+ - mice died of Hirschsprung disease before weaning (3 weeks of age), majority of Gdnf+ - mice appear to be normal and reach to adulthood. However, detailed life-course epidemiology study on a large cohort of 5,000 mice revealed accelerated aging, defined as increased morbidity and mortality, in mice missing a functioning allele at Gdnf or Gfra1 locus or both. Except few adult mice that develop severe polycystic kidney disease before 7 months of age, or exhibit fecal retention, a sign of chronic constipation, Gdnf and Gfra1 deficient mice are at increased risk to develop or more likely to die of many common chronic diseases, such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, type II diabetes, cancer and senile dementia (manscript in preparation). Many confounding factors known to affect disease frequency, such as the genetic background, environmental factors and the parental origin of mutant alleles are excluded. The life course epidemiological study on these mice points to a common link underlying the diverse clinical manifestations in the cohort. Our previous findings on specific kidney and gastrointestinal tract defects in these homozygous mice at birth lead us to hypothesize that the increased risk for chronic diseases and accelerated aging of the cohort may be a result of impaired homeostasis, due to reduced inborn kidney organ reserve, in addition to direct effect of GDNF expression in adult organs. To provide direct experimental evidence that chronic diseases are the diseases of the system, we took a systematic and quantitative approach to trace the genotypic difference in lifespan, frequency of diseases, the age of onset, gender bias, to a subtle difference in renal filtering capacity at birth. We found that the organ reserve at birth is the most predictive of life course as adult. Detailed systematic approach revealed a stereotypic, sequential, dynamic and hierarchical system level integration that can be traced back to inborn renal capacity: The attempt of an organism to compensate for the inborn deficiency increases the risk to chronic diseases in diverse organs in a genotype and time-specific manner. The population genetics study of single gene mutations bridges the gap between longitudinal epidemiological studies in humans and the population studies in other model organisms like yeast, Drosophila and C. elegans. The dynamisms revealed by this systematic integrative approach will yield much needed insight on preclinical diagnoses, prior to clinical manifestation of diseases, and on preventative and therapeutic strategies (manscript in preparation).

       " 'Aging is a major risk factor of human cancers. Our project is to elucidate molecular mechanisms of aging and cancer using cellular and animal models. We have shown that normal human cells have telomerase-dependent and independent pathways for cellular senescence, which both serve as a tumor suppressive mechanism. The senescence genes on chromosome 3p21 (a transcriptional repressor of the telomerase hTERT gene) and chromosome 1q42.3 (which functions independently of telomerase regulation) are to be cloned by the positional and functional cloning methods. To understand a link between cellular aging and organismal aging, we study SIRTs, human homologs of the yeast worm longevity gene Sir-2 encoding a NAD-dependent protein deacetylase. Our data suggest the more complex regulation of aging processes in humans than in yeast or worms and multiple functions of human SIRT proteins at different cellular locations (i.e., nucleus, nucleolus, cytoplasm and mitochondria). We have found that DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) accumulate in mammalian cells during both cellular senescence and in vivo aging, providing important insight into the mechanism by which cellular senescence contribute to organismal aging. We are also examining how various local or systemic conditions (e.g., hypoxia, oxidative stress, obesity, calorie intake) affect the above-mentioned pathways factors to regulate human aging and carcinogenesis processes.',\n",
       " 'All living cells can sense their environment. The term directional sensing refers to the ability of a cell to determine the direction and proximity of an extracellular stimulus. Directional sensing is needed to detect morphogens that control differentiation and attractants that direct cell migration, as in chemotaxis. This fascinating response is critical in embryogenesis, angiogenesis, neuronal patterning, wound healing, and immunity. Chemotaxis is strikingly exhibited during the life cycle of the social amoebae, Dictyostelium discoideum. During growth, these cells track down and phagocytose bacteria. When starved, they move towards secreted adenosine 3\\'-5\\' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) signals, form aggregates, and differentiate into spore and stalk cells. The fundamental role of chemotaxis in this simple eukaryote provides a powerful system for its analysis at both genetic and biochemical levels. Both amoebae and mammalian leukocytes use G protein-linked signaling pathways to respond to chemoattractants. Binding of the attractants to receptors of the seven transmembrane helix class leads to the dissociation of the G proteins into alpha and beta gamma-subunits. In both leukocytes and amoebae, chemoattractants elicit a variety of rapid responses including transient increases in Ca2+ influx, in the intracellular messengers IP3, cAMP and guanosine 3\\'-5\\' cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), and in the phosphorylation of myosins I and II. Chemoattractants also induce actin polymerization, most likely through the activation of the Rho family of small guanosine trisphosphatases. All these events rapidly subside in the presence of persistent stimulation. This rapid inhibition may allow a migrating cell to \"subtract\" the ambient concentration of attractant and more accurately sense the direction of a gradient. Our research program is focused on learning how specific G protein-coupled signaling events translate into complex cellular responses such as cell migration and differentiation. In D.discoideum, genetic analyses have established that the activation of adenylyl cyclase (ACA) requires, in addition to the beta gamma-subunits of G proteins, a novel protein called CRAC (cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase). We have shown that CRAC, which contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at its N-terminus, translocates rapidly and transiently to the plasma membrane upon addition of a chemoattractant. Remarkably, this translocation occurs selectively at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells. In both leukocytes and amoebae, other PH domain-containing proteins such as PKB (Akt) behave similarly. We have proposed that the appearance of specific binding sites for PH domain-containing proteins at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells spatially targets signaling events. My group is interested in identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate these pathways and in particular the role of adenylyl cyclase in chemotaxis. Our research plan is comprised of three interconnected specific aims: (1) Identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of CRAC, (2) Study the spatial and temporal localization of adenylyl cyclases in chemotaxing cells, and (3) Identify the mechanisms of activation of adenylyl cyclases in neutrophils. These studies have direct bearing on our understanding of clinically important processes such leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation as well as cancer metastasis.',\n",
       " 'Members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of peptide growth factors, which include TGF-beta, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and activins, regulate a broad range of cellular processes from cell growth and differentiation to apoptosis. The signaling responses to TGF-beta and other family members are mediated by a heteromeric complex of two types of transmembrane serine threonine kinase receptors at the cell surface, and their intracellular substrates, the Smad proteins. Proper TGF-beta superfamily signaling requires precise control of Smad functions. One of the important mechanisms that control Smad activity is ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. Previously, we and others identified Smurf1 and Smurf2, two new members of the HECT family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, as interacting partners for Smads, but the in vivo function of Smurfs and the selectivity of Smurfs towards Smad in specific signaling pathways remain to be determined. We continued our research interest in this area and began to address these important biological issues. We examined the role of Smurf1 in myogenic and osteogenic differentiation by taking advantage of the in vitro differentiation process of mouse C2C12 myoblast cells, which is subject to control by both TGF-beta and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). We found that increased expression of Smurf1 promotes myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells and blocks the BMP-induced osteogenic conversion but has no effect on the TGF-beta-induced differentiation arrest. Consistent with an inhibitory role in the BMP signaling pathway, the elevated Smurf1 markedly reduces the level of endogenous Smad5 while it leaves unaltered the levels of Smad2, Smad3 and Smad7, which are components of the TGF-beta pathway. Adding back Smad5 from a different source to the Smurf1-overexpressing cells restores the BMP-mediated osteoblast conversion. Finally, by depletion of endogenous Smurf1 through small interfering RNA-mediated RNA interference, we demonstrated that Smurf1 is required for the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells and plays an important regulatory role in the BMP-2-mediated osteoblast conversion. Although Smads are involved in most actions of the TGF-beta superfamily, many reports have suggested that TGF-beta may signal through alternative pathways. In order to characterize the mechanism of TGF-beta signaling through Smad-independent pathways and to understand the function of Smad-independent TGF-beta receptor signaling, we have generated a mutant TGF-beta type I receptor that is unable to activate Smads but retains kinase activity. We found that this mutant TGF-beta type I receptor is able to activate p38 kinase, and the p38 activation is required for TGF-beta induced apoptosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. These results indicate that the TGF-beta receptor exerts its signals through multiple intracellular pathways and provide first hand biochemical evidence to support the existence of Smad-independent TGF-beta receptor signaling. Currently we are working to identify downstream mediators that are responsible for Smad-independent TGF-beta receptor signaling. These studies could uncover novel molecular mechanisms that account for a number of Smad-independent TGF-beta signaling responses. In addition, we are also interested in how TGF-beta signaling converges with other pathways in response to growth factors and consequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK) pathways. We would like to understand the role of this cross-talk in controlling TGF-beta-regulated gene transcription, cell proliferation, extracellular matrix production,apoptosis and tumor progression. In the meantime, a long term research program using mouse genetics to address the physiological and pathological roles of TGF-beta Smad signaling in tumorigenesis has also been initiated.',\n",
       " 'Our objective is to understand the factors regulating de novo DNA methylation in normal cells and during development and determine how these control pathways go awry in tumor cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. DNA methylation, or the covalent addition of a methyl group to the 5-position of cytosine in the context of the CpG dinucleotide, is required for mammalian development, has profound effects on chromatin structure, and has roles in both DNA repair and genome stability. It has become clear that while essential for development, DNA methylation patterns become dysregulated in cancer, with a generalized genome-wide hypomethylation (loss) in combination with region-specific hypermethylation (gain), primarily at CpG islands. In addition, DNA hypermethylation has been shown to efficiently and heritably inactivate genes. When this occurs in the promoter region of a growth-regulatory gene it can give that cell a growth advantage and ultimately lead to cancer.Mechanisms for the establishment or targeting of methylation patterns in normal cells are almost completely unknown and thus we have focused our studies on the regulation of the cellular enzymatic methylation machinery, the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).. Methylation clearly can be targeted since certain genomic regions are always heavily methylated, like pericentromeric heterochromatin (regions of DNA adjacent to the centromere) while regulatory regions for many essential genes are always unmethylated. We have taken a biochemical approach to identify factors that interact with the DNMTs that may alter their nuclear localization and enhance or inhibit their enzymatic activites on particular DNA substrates. Our studies reveal that the most abundant methyltransferase, DNMT1, interacts with the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb). Rb is a critical regulator of cell division and helps a cell decide whether to divide or to go into a semi-permanent resting state. Rb, or other components of the Rb pathway, are mutated in almost all tumor cells. We have determined that cancer-associated mutations in Rb abolish the ability of Rb to interact with DNMT1. Thus we may have identified one mechanism whereby methylation patterns become disrupted in tumors due to an inability of Rb to interact with DNMT1. The identification of factors that interact with and direct methylation in normal cells opens up exciting new possibilities for understanding tumor development and may ultimately lead to novel therapies designed to restore normal methylation patterns and growth control.',\n",
       " 'Hypoxia - a deficiency of oxygen reaching the tissues of the body - occurs during a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including placenta development, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, cerebral and myocardial ischemia, and tumorigenesis. In particular, solid tumors harbor hypoxic regions that are not only critical for tumor development and progression, but also associated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Hypoxic stress also affects cell metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis. Given the essential role of hypoxia for cell proliferation and survival, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms of hypoxic response at cellular and molecular levels. The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) is a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis responsible for transcriptional upregulation of a variety of hypoxia-responsive genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor, nitric oxide synthases, glucose transporters, and glycolytic enzymes. Our research focuses on the mechanisms underlying HIF-1alpha activation, the role of HIF-1alpha in tumorigenesis, and the molecular basis for therapeutic targeting. Previously, we and others demonstrated that HIF-1alpha activation is regulated primarily by posttranslational modifications, resulting in increased protein stability and transcriptional activity. The HIF-1alpha level is controlled by oxygen-dependent proteolysis via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that targets the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of HIF-1alpha. The HIF-1alpha E3 ubiquitin ligase contains the tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, which binds ODD and catalyzes polyubiquitination of HIF-1alpha. The VHL protein interacts with HIF-1alpha via a specific recognition of hydroxylated Pro402 or Pro564, both of which are modified in normoxia by a family of prolyl-4-hydroxylases functioning as oxygen sensors. To gain insights into the molecular determinant of prolyl hydroxylation, we recently identified a leucine residue (Leu-574) downstream of Pro-564 to be crucial for the VHL-mediated degradation of HIF-1alpha. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the leucine residue is required for recruiting a key HIF prolyl-4-hydrxylase. Thus, the identification of Leu-574 may provide a molecular basis for drug targeting of HIF-1alpha activity.Solid tumors contain hypoxic regions that may induce mutations of critical genes, ultimately resulting in genomic instability. The role of HIF-1alpha in tumorigenesis has been implicated by the heightened expression of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, a close member of the family, and by the correlation of their overexpression with poor diagnosis. By taking advantage of our unique understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying HIF-1alpha stability and transcriptional activity, we have begun to explore the role of hypoxia in tumorigenesis, drug resistance, and tumor progression. Recently, we unraveled the mechanism by which hypoxia induces cell-cycle arrest. Moreover, we proposed a novel HIF-1alpha-Myc pathway that accounts for how hypoxia regulates genes involved in drug resistance and genomic instability. We are testing this new pathway by focusing on the role of HIF-1alpha in DNA mismatch repair. Lastly, our mechanistic studies of HIF-1alpha activation may provide a molecular basis for the development of therapeutic agents that could alter HIF-1alpha activity and its downstream target gene expression during tumor development and progression.',\n",
       " 'A POTENTIAL APPROACH TO IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL): ENHANCED IMMUNOGENICITY OF CLL CELLS VIA INFECTION WITH VECTORS ENCODING FOR MULTIPLE COSTIMULATORY MOLECULES. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease of CD5+ B lymphocytes (designated as CLL cells) that are inefficient antigen-presenting cells. Their poor ability to present antigens to the T cells, largely due to an inadequate costimulatory capacity, is manifested as a failure to stimulate proliferation of both allogeneic and autologous T cells. We have investigated the ability of in vitro manipulated CLL cells, via hyperexpression of a triad of costimulatory molecules (B7-1, ICAM-1 and LFA-3, designated TRICOM), to stimulate effective anti-tumor T-cell responses. A recombinant Modified Vaccinia Virus strain Ankara (MVA), which is a highly attenuated, replication-impaired virus variant, was successfully used to infect and deliver the simultaneous expression of the 3 human costimulatory molecules in TRICOM on the surface of the CLL cells. Proliferation of allogeneic and autologous T cells was observed when MVA-TRICOM infected CLL cells were used as stimulators in proliferation assays. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, generated in vitro by stimulation of autologous T cells with MVA-TRICOM-infected CLL cells, showed cytotoxicity against unmodified uninfected CLL cells. Therefore, our findings suggest that the use of CLL cells infected ex vivo with MVA-TRICOM or direct injection of MVA-TRICOM in CLL patients has potential for the immunotherapy of CLL.PHASE I STUDY OF SEQUENTIAL VACCINATIONS WITH FOWLPOX-CEA(6D)-TRICOM ALONE AND SEQUENTIALLY WITH VACCINIA-CEA(6D)-TRICOM, WITH AND WITHOUT GRANULOCYTE-MACROPHAGE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR, IN PATIENTS WITH CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN-EXPRESSING CARCINOMAS. Previous clinical experience with vaccinia and replication-defective avipox recombinant carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) vaccines has demonstrated safety and clinical activity with a correlation between CEA-specific immune response and survival. Preclinical evidence demonstrated that the addition of the transgenes for three T-cell costimulatory molecules (B7-1, ICAM-1, LFA-3, designated TRICOM) results in a significant improvement in antigen-specific T-cell responses and antitumor activity. We have completed the first trial in humans of the CEA-TRICOM vaccines (also including an enhancer agonist epitope within the CEA gene). Fifty-eight patients with advanced CEA-expressing cancers were accrued to eight cohorts that involved vaccinations with the following: replication-defective fowlpox recombinant (rF)-CEA(6D)-TRICOM; primary vaccination with recombinant vaccinia (rV)-CEA(6D)-TRICOM plus rF-CEA(6D)-TRICOM booster vaccinations; and rV-CEA(6D)-TRICOM and then rF-CEA(6D)-TRICOM, plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with vaccines, or with divided doses of vaccine with GM-CSF. Vaccines were administered every 28 days for six doses and then once every 3 months. Reverting to treatments every 28 days was allowed if patients progressed on the 3-month schedule. In this phase I study, no significant toxicity was observed. Twenty-three patients (40%) had stable disease for at least 4 months, with 14 of these patients having prolonged stable disease (> 6 months). Eleven patients had decreasing or stable serum CEA, and one patient had a pathologic complete response. Enhanced CEA-specific T-cell responses were observed in the majority of patients tested. We demonstrated that the CEA-TRICOM vaccines are safe and can generate significant CEA-specific immune responses, and they seem to have clinical benefit in some patients with advanced cancer.COMBINING A RECOMBINANT CANCER VACCINE WITH STANDARD DEFINITIVE RADIOTHERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCER. Many patients with clinically localized prostate cancer develop biochemical failure despite excellent local therapy perhaps due to occult metastatic disease.',\n",
       " 'The activation of T cells has been shown to require at least two signals via molecules present on professional antigen-presenting cells: signal 1 via a peptide MHC complex, and signal 2 via a costimulatory molecule. Studies are being conducted on the impact of hyperexpression of multiple costimulatory molecules in the activation of T cells. Pox virus vectors (vaccinia and avipox) are being used because of their ability to efficiently express multiple transgenes. Murine tumor cells provided with signal 1 and infected with either recombinant vaccinia or avipox vectors containing a TRIad of COstimulatory Molecules (B7-1 ICAM-1 LFA-3, designated TRICOM) induce the activation of T cells to a far greater extent than cells infected with any one or two costimulatory molecules. Despite this T-cell \"hyperstimulation\" using TRICOM vectors, no evidence of increased apoptosis was seen. Studies have shown that dendritic cells infected with TRICOM vectors are rendered more efficient in enhancing T-cell responses. Peptide-pulsed dendritic cells infected with rF-TRICOM or rV-TRICOM induced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity in vitro and in vivo to a markedly greater extent than peptide-pulsed dendritic cells. These studies thus demonstrate the ability of vectors to introduce three costimulatory molecules into cells, thereby activating T-cell populations to levels far greater than those achieved with the use of one or two costimulatory molecules. This new threshold of T-cell activation in vaccine design is currently being studied.Local radiation is an established therapy for human tumors. Radiation also has now been shown to alter the phenotype of target tissue, including gene products that may make tumor cells more susceptible to T-cell-mediated immune attack. We have demonstrated a biological synergy between local radiation of tumor and active vaccine therapy. The model used consisted of mice transgenic for human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and a murine carcinoma cell line transfected with CEA. The vaccine regimen consisted of a prime and boost strategy using vaccinia and avipox recombinants expressing CEA and three T-cell costimulatory molecules. One dose of 8-Gy radiation to tumor induced up-regulation of the death receptor Fas in situ for up to 11 days. However, neither radiation at this dose nor vaccine therapy was capable of inhibiting growth of established tumor. When vaccine therapy and local radiation of tumor were used in combination, dramatic and significant cures were achieved. This was mediated by the engagement of the Fas Fas ligand pathway because Ag-bearing tumor cells expressing dominant-negative Fas were not susceptible to this combination therapy. Following the combination of vaccine and local radiation, tumors demonstrated a massive infiltration of T cells not seen with either modality alone. Mice cured of tumors demonstrated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses specific for CEA but also revealed the induction of high levels of T-cell responses to two other antigens overexpressed in tumor, indicating the presence of a consequential antigen cascade. Thus, these studies demonstrate a new paradigm for the use of local tumor irradiation in combination with active specific vaccine therapy to elicit durable antitumor responses of established tumors.Intratumoral (i.t.) vaccination represents a potential modality for the therapy of tumors. Previous i.t. vaccination studies have focused on the efficacy of i.t. vaccination alone. There are no reports that clearly compared i.t. vaccination with systemic vaccination achieved by s.c., intradermal, or i.m. injection, or combining both modalities of systemic and i.t. vaccination. We have compared the antitumor effects induced by a systemic vaccination regimen (s.c.) and i.t. vaccination, and a sequential s.c i.t. vaccination regimen. We have used a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the transgenes for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and a triad of T-cell costimulatory molecules (designated rV-CEA TRICOM) for s.c. priming and a replication defective avipox (fowlpox) virus containing the same four transgenes (designated rF-CEA TRICOM) for i.t. vaccination or s.c. booster vaccinations. Vaccination was started on day 8 after s.c. implantation with CEA-positive tumors. We compared the antitumor activity induced by these vaccines when administered via the i.t. route versus the s.c. route. Subsequent therapy studies examined the sequential combination of these routes, s.c. priming with rV-CEA TRICOM followed by i.t. boosting with rF-CEA TRICOM. The results demonstrate that the antitumor activity induced by i.t. vaccination is superior to that induced by s.c. vaccination. For more advanced tumors, a s.c. priming vaccination, followed by i.t. boosting vaccinations was superior to either s.c. or i.t. vaccination alone. Both of these phenomena were observed in tumor models where the tumor-associated antigen is a foreign antigen and in a CEA-transgenic tumor model where the tumor-associated antigen is a self-antigen. The cytokine, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor admixed in vaccines, was shown to be essential in inducing the antitumor activity. These studies demonstrate that the diversified vaccine regimens that consisted of s.c. prime and i.t. boosts with CEA TRICOM vectors could induce antitumor therapy superior to that seen by either route alone.',\n",
       " 'ANALYSES OF RECOMBINANT VACCINIA AND FOWLPOX VACCINE VECTORS EXPRESSING TRANSGENES FOR TWO HUMAN TUMOR ANTIGENS AND THREE HUMAN COSTIMULATORY MOLECULES. The poor immunogenicity of tumor antigens and the antigenic heterogeneity of tumors call for vaccine strategies to enhance T-cell responses to multiple antigens. Two antigens expressed noncoordinately on most human carcinomas are carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and MUC-1. We have reported the construction and characterization of two viral vector vaccines to address these issues. The two viral vectors analyzed are the replication-competent recombinant vaccinia virus (rV-) and the avipox vector, fowlpox (rF-), which is replication incompetent in mammalian cells. Each vector encodes the transgenes for three human costimulatory molecules (B7-1, ICAM-1, and LFA-3, designated TRICOM) and the CEA and MUC-1 transgenes (which also contain agonist epitopes). The vectors are designated rV-CEA MUC TRICOM and rF-CEA MUC TRICOM. Each of the vectors is shown to be capable of faithfully expressing all five transgenes in human dendritic cells (DC). DCs infected with either vector are shown to activate both CEA- and MUC-1-specific T-cell lines to the same level as DCs infected with CEA-TRICOM or MUC-1-TRICOM vectors. Thus, no evidence of antigenic competition between CEA and MUC-1 was observed. Human DCs infected with rV-CEA MUC TRICOM or rF-CEA MUC TRICOM are also shown to be capable of generating both MUC-1- and CEA-specific T-cell lines; these T-cell lines are in turn shown to be capable of lysing targets pulsed with MUC-1 or CEA peptides as well as human tumor cells endogenously expressing MUC-1 and or CEA. These studies provided the rationale for the clinical evaluation of these multigene vectors in patients with a range of carcinomas expressing MUC-1 and or CEA. INDUCTION OF HIGHER-AVIDITY HUMAN CTLS BY VECTOR-MEDIATED ENHANCED COSTIMULATION OF ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS. The efficacy of antigen-specific CD8(+) CTLs depends not only on the quantity of CTLs generated but also perhaps, more importantly, on the avidity of the CTLs. To date, however, no strategy has been shown to preferentially induce higher-avidity human CTLs. In these studies, antigen-presenting cells (APC) generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were infected with a recombinant avipox vector (rF-) containing the transgenes for a triad of costimulatory molecules (human B7.1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and LFA-3, designated as rF-TRICOM) and then used to elicit peptide-specific CTLs from autologous T cells. Compared with peptide-pulsed noninfected APCs or peptide-pulsed APCs infected with wild-type vector, peptide-pulsed APCs infected with rF-TRICOM induced not only more CTLs but also higher-avidity CTLs; this was shown by tetramer staining, tetramer dissociation, IFN-gamma production, and cytolytic assays. Peptide-pulsed rF-TRICOM-infected dendritic cells were also shown to induce CTLs with a >10-fold higher avidity than CTLs induced using CD40L-matured dendritic cells; the use of peptide-pulsed CD40L-matured dendritic cells infected with rF-TRICOM as APCs induced CTLs of even greater avidity. To our knowledge, these studies are the first to show a methodology to induce higher-avidity human CTLs and have implications for the development of more efficient vaccines for a range of human cancers. HUMAN B CELLS THAT HYPEREXPRESS A TRIAD OF COSTIMULATORY MOLECULES VIA AVIPOX-VECTOR INFECTION: AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF EFFICIENT ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent of the antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Preparation of sufficient numbers of mature DCs, however, is both costly and time-consuming. We have examined the possibility of using an alternative source of APCs that would be easier to obtain, would not require extensive culture, and thus would be more applicable to human immunotherapy protocols.',\n",
       " \"COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF AVIPOX-GM-CSF VERSUS RECOMBINANT GM-CSF PROTEIN AS IMMUNE ADJUVANTS WITH DIFFERENT VACCINE PLATFORMS. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a potent immune stimulant when administered with different vaccines. Optimal use of GM-CSF resides in its ability to act locally to stimulate the proliferation and maturation of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (i.e., Langerhans' cells) at the injection site. GM-CSF was engineered into a replication-incompetent recombinant avian (fowlpox) virus (rF-GM-CSF) and a single subcutaneous injection resulted in a sustained enrichment of activated dendritic cells within the regional draining lymph nodes. Those changes were attributed to local GM-CSF production at the injection site by rF-GM-CSF-infected cells. Studies were carried out in which mice were administered different types of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal)-based vaccines--whole protein, peptide, recombinant poxviruses--and GM-CSF was administered either as a single injection of rF-GM-CSF or four daily bolus injections of the recombinant protein. The use of rF-GM-CSF either improved the immune adjuvant effect, as observed for poxvirus-based vaccines, or was equivalent to rGM-CSF, as observed with the beta-gal protein vaccine. It is important to note that with either the replication-competent (vaccinia) or replication-incompetent (fowlpox) vaccines expressing LacZ, strong CTL responses directed against beta-gal were induced only when rF-GM-CSF was used as the immune adjuvant. Engineering GM-CSF into a recombinant fowlpox virus offers an excellent vehicle for the delivery of this cytokine as an immune adjuvant with specific vaccine platforms. In particular, delivery of GM-CSF via the rF-GM-CSF construct would be preferred over bolus injections of rGM-CSF when used as an immune adjuvant with whole protein or recombinant poxvirus-based vaccines. The study underscores the importance of defining the appropriate delivery form of an immune adjuvant, such as GM-CSF, relative to the immunization strategy to maximize the host immune responses against a specific antigen.COMBINATION OF A POXVIRUS-BASED VACCINE WITH A CYCLOOXYGENASE-2 INHIBITOR (CELECOXIB) ELICITS ANTITUMOR IMMUNITY AND LONG-TERM SURVIVAL IN CEA.TG MIN MICE. This study was designed to determine whether: (a) chronic administration of dietary celecoxib (Celebrex), a potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which targets the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, negatively impacts host immunity; and (b) celecoxib can be coupled with a poxvirus-based vaccine to impact tumor burden in a murine tumor model of spontaneous adenomatous polyposis coli. Naive mice fed the celecoxib-supplemented diets developed eosinophilia with lowered plasma prostaglandin E(2) levels and reduced COX-2 mRNA expression levels in their splenic T cells. Responses of splenic T, B, and natural killer cells to broad-based and antigen-specific stimuli were, for the most part, unchanged in those mice as well as COX-2 knockout mice; exceptions included: (a) reduced IFN-gamma production by concanavalin A- or antigen-stimulated T cells; and (b) heightened lipopolysaccharide response of naive B cells from mice fed a diet supplemented with 1000 ppm of celecoxib. When transgenic mice that express the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene (CEA transgenic) were bred with mice bearing a mutation in the Apc(Delta850) gene (multiple intestinal neoplasia mice), the progeny (CEA transgenic multiple intestinal neoplasia) spontaneously develop multiple intestinal neoplasms that overexpress CEA and COX-2. Beginning at 30 days of age, the administration of a diversified prime boost recombinant CEA-poxvirus-based vaccine regimen or celecoxib (1000 ppm)-supplemented diet reduced the number of intestinal neoplasms by 54% and 65%, respectively.\",\n",
       " 'SDR GRAFTING OF A MURINE ANTIBODY USING MULTIPLE HUMAN GERMLINE TEMPLATES TO MINIMIZE ITS IMMUNOGENICITY. The humanization of mAbs by complementarity-determining region (CDR)-grafting has become a standard procedure to improve the clinical utility of xenogeneic Abs by reducing human anti-murine Ab (HAMA) responses elicited in patients. However, CDR-grafted humanized Abs may still evoke anti-V region responses when administered in patients. To minimize anti-V region responses, the Ab may be humanized by grafting onto the human templates only the specificity-determining residues (SDRs), the residues that are essential for the surface complementarity of the Ab and its ligand. Typically, humanization of an Ab, whether by CDR or SDR grafting, involves the use of a single human template for the entire VL or VH domain of an Ab. We hypothesized, however, that the homology between the human template sequences and mAb to be humanized may be maximized by using templates from multiple human germline sequences corresponding to the different segments of the variable domain. This could be more advantageous in reducing the potential immunogenicity of the humanized Ab. This study describes the SDR grafting of the murine anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mAb COL-1 using three different human germline V-kappa sequences as templates for the VL CDRs and another human template for the VL frameworks. In competition RIAs, the SDR-grafted COL-1 (HuCOL-1SDR) completely inhibited the binding of radiolabeled murine COL-1 (mCOL-1) to CEA, and showed that its binding affinity is comparable to that of the CDR-grafted Ab (HuCOL-1). The HuCOL-1SDR showed similar binding reactivity to the CEA expressed on the surface of a tumor cell line as the HuCOL-1. More importantly, compared to HuCOL-1 and the \"abbreviated\" CDR-grafted Ab, HuCOL-1SDR showed lower reactivity to patients\\' sera carrying anti-V region Abs to mCOL-1. HuCOL-1SDR, which shows a lower sera reactivity than that of the parental Abs while retaining its Ag-binding property, is a potentially useful clinical reagent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a VL or VH domain of an Ab has been humanized by grafting the SDRs onto a human template comprised of several Ab sequences. We have shown that humanization of an Ab can be optimized using multiple human templates for a single variable domain of an Ab. This approach maximizes the homology between the target Ab and the human templates in both the frameworks and the CDRs by choosing as the template the human sequence that displays the highest local sequence identity to the frameworks and to each of the CDRs of the target Ab.RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY OF HUMAN COLON CARCINOMA XENOGRAFTS USING A 213BI-LABELED DOMAIN-DELETED HUMANIZED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY. We have carried out the first study of a humanized domain-deleted monoclonal antibody (HuCC49DeltaCH2) to be utilized in a radioimmunotherapeutic (RIT) application with 213Bi. An initial study indicated that 111In-HuCC49DeltaCH2 targets the subcutaneously implanted human colon carcinoma xenograft, LS-174T, when injected via a peritoneal route. The HuCC49DeltaCH2 was then radiolabeled with 213Bi, an alpha-emitting radionuclide with a half-life of 45.6 minutes, and evaluated for therapeutic efficacy. Dose titration studies indicated that a single dose of 500-1000 microCi, when injected by an intraperitoneal route, resulted in the growth inhibition or regression of the tumor xenograft. The radioimmunotherapeutic effect was found to be dose-dependent. Specificity of the therapeutic efficacy was confirmed in a subsequent experiment with athymic mice bearing TAG-72 negative MIP (human colorectal) xenografts. A preliminary study was also performed to assess a multiple-dose administration of 213Bi-HuCC49DeltaCH2. Doses (500 microCi) were administered at 14-day intervals after tumor implantation.',\n",
       " 'Progression of cancers to the metastatic state involves multiple cellular and genetic changes. Acquisition of metastatic ability requires loss of metastasis suppressor functions, as well as activation of metastasis promoting functions. Starting from the chromosome mapping of metastasis suppressor genes, followed by a combination of positional and functional cloning strategies, we identified KAI1, a human gene that suppresses the metastatic ability in a rat prostate cancer model. The significance of KAI1 in human tumor metastasis was shown by the marked decrease in KAI1 expression in metastatic tumors of various tissue origins compared with their normal or non-metastatic counterparts, suggesting KAI1 as an excellent diagnostic and prognostic marker. Identification of the KAI1 binding partners (e.g., E-cadherin and catenins) by yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays provided clues to molecular details of the KAI1 function. By using the same experimental system, we have recently cloned another metastasis suppressor gene, termed Tey1, on human chromosome 8p21, where LOH is frequently observed in many types of human cancers. Cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Tey1 suppresses metastasis are under investigation. We are also investigating, by genome-wide gene expression profiling, downstream target genes that are controlled by KAI1- and Tey1-regulated signaling pathways.',\n",
       " 'ResearchThe general focus of my research revolves around the study of the coordination of tissue specific gene expression during differentiation, from the cell surface to changes in gene transcription. To understand this process we have taken a systems level approach utilizing microarray and proteomic methodologies in conjunction with inhibitor and promoter analysis of MC3T3-E1 cells. My studies are currently focused on the role of inorganic phosphate that is generated during osteoblast differentiation, as a novel-signaling molecule capable of ultimately altering gene expression of a number of phosphate responsive genes including the transformation and metastasis associated osteopontin, as well as the Nrf2, a key transcription factor in the response of phase I detoxifying enzymes and putative target for chemoprevention, The study of this model system and the regulation of these genes in particular provide the potential that future results might impact a number of disease states including cancer, bone metabolic disorders, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis and kidney disease.A systems level approach to understanding inorganic phosphate signaling and the regulation of Osteopontin and Nrf2 Our previously published results detailed the discovery that elevated inorganic phosphate results in increased expression of osteopontin not only in MC3T3-E1 cells but also in other cell types including the fibroblast cell line NIH3T3, defines a novel mechanism for gene regulation. Osteopontin is a multi-faceted extracellular matrix protein expressed in most tissues. Studies involving reduced levels of osteopontin have shown that it is required for bone remodeling, wound healing and as a key cytokine in efficient type-1 immune responses. Elevated levels of the osteopontin are associated with various disease states including transformation, metastasis, atherosclerosis and kidney disease. A high level of expression of osteopontin is associated with the poor prognosis of many cancers. Although expression of this gene has been demonstrated in multiple tissue types its regulation is not well understood. We have identified three key signaling pathways in osteopontin expression including ERK1 2, PKC and the proteosome. The proteasome is required for expression of osteopontin not only in response to phosphate but also in response to the tumor promoters, TPA and okadaic acid. This suggests the proteasome may be an important component in the regulation of osteopontin not only in osteoblasts in response to elevated phosphate but in the global regulation of osteopontin expression in response to a host of stimuli. Furthermore, given the correlation between elevated osteopontin RNA levels and the metastatic phenotype of many cancer cells these results may provide insight into evaluating proteasome inhibitors as cancer therapeutics. We are currently defining promoter element(s) and transcription factor(s) that regulate osteopontin expression in response to elevated phosphate. Using Microarray technology we have determined that, in fact, numerous genes are regulated by elevated inorganic phosphate including, Nrf2 a key transcription factor in the regulation of phase II detoxifying enzymes, responsible for the detoxification of carcinogens. Loss of function of Nrf2 has been linked to carcinogenesis. We have identified Nrf2 as an immediate response gene to phosphate stimulation during osteoblast differentiation, and cloning of the promoter confirmed that Nrf2 is transcriptionally regulated by increased inorganic phosphate. We continue to study the Nrf2 promoter with the goal of understanding how this key factor in chemoprevention is regulated.The goal of fully understanding the cellular response to a given stimuli or changing environment is currently limited by the inability to fully evaluate the proteome. The ability to conduct an analysis of changes in both protein abundance and RNA levels on a systems scale sufficient to entirely enumerate the response of a cell will undoubtedly be a powerful tool in assessing not only complex cellular processes such as differentiation but should also provide clues as to how to manipulate the cell phenotype by intervention. To this end we haveconducted a coordinated proteome and microarray analysis of inorganic phosphate treated pre-osteoblasts. The results from these studies describe one of the largest proteome databases derived from differentially treated mammalian samples. A comparison of the cICAT derived protein data with microarray samples has lead to the determination that analyzing RNA levels at numerous time points leading up to a given proteome time point may give a more accurate picture of the transcription translation relationship. Furthermore this type of comparison can lead to novel methods of data extraction including the identification of posttranslationally regulated proteins as evidenced by Fra-1. The data presented here reveal not only novel insights into the role of inorganic phosphate in altering cell function but also provide an initial glimpse at the power of combining large scale protein and RNA analysis for a systems level understanding of the cell. The swi snf complex and adipogenesis.A related project in the lab revolves around the role of Smarcf1 (SWI SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily f, member 1) in differentiation. Smarcf1 is an integral member of human SWI SNF complexes. These complexes are chromatin modifying machines that play fundamental roles in the regulation of gene expression during cell growth and development in all organisms. Sequence analysis revealed that Smarcf1 has a group of four LXXLL (L is leucine and X is any amino acid) motifs located towards the C-terminus of the protein. This motif has been demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for interaction with liganded nuclear hormone receptors. The function of other LXXLL containing proteins is to assist in the formation of a complex between upstream transcriptional activators enhancers and the basal transcriptional machinery, including TBP. The potential interaction between various nuclear hormone receptors and Smarcf1, a protein associated with a complex that contains chromatin-modifying activity suggests a role for Smarcf1 as an integrator of hormone signaling and transcription initiation. We are currently using a model of adipocyte differentiation to examine the potential role(s) of Smarcf1 and the SWI SNF complex in differentiation.',\n",
       " 'A major goal of this project is to identify and study important new therapeutic options for patients with metastatic breast cancer. These options include biologics and molecularly targeted therapy such as erlotonib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Description of the progress on several of these trials is discussed below. Also two new therapeutic agents will be place in clinical trials under this project. These include pertuzumab and lapatinib.ErlotinibThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed in several solid tumors, including breast cancer. Its expression in breast carcinomas is reported to be in the range of 14% to 91% and has been associated with poor prognosis, increased risk of recurrence, and poor response to hormonal therapy. Upon ligand binding, EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) is activated. It is this tyrosine kinase activity that is the target of several EGFR-TK inhibitors, such as erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva; OSI Pharmaceuticals, Melville, NY). Erlotinib represents a class of compounds that can prevent EGFR activation and interrupts downstream signaling, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase AKT pathways, both of which are important in tumor cell proliferation. Erlotinib has been shown to inhibit EGFR-TK in vitro (IC50 of 2 nM) and reduce EGFR autophosphorylation in intact tumor cells (IC50 of 20 nM). Because of problems inherent in evaluating tumor-specific activity of EGFR-TK inhibitors, there is a need for an appropriate surrogate tissue for evaluating activity. The skin is one such tissue because it expresses EGFR, is readily accessible, and is a site of frequently occurring toxicity. EGFR has also been shown to be present in human buccal mucosa. The pharmacodynamic effects of erlotinib and gefitinib, another EGFR-TK inhibitor, have been described in pre- and post-treatment normal skin specimens. Therapy directed at EGFR-TK represented a potentially novel therapeutic approach in metastatic breast cancer. Because erlotinib targets the EGFR-TK, we hypothesized it would have inhibitory effects on intermediate points in the EGFR signaling pathway. We conducted a pilot study in 18 patients, in which we treated them with erlotinib 150 mg daily and performed serial biopsies on tumor, buccal mucosa, and skin. We evaluated levels of Ki67, EGFR, phosphorylated-EGFR (phospho-EGFR), -MAPK (phospho-MAPK) and -AKT (phospho-AKT), in all three tissues.We also determined drug pharmacokinetics pre- and post-treatment with erlotinib. We found that the stratum corneum layer and Ki67 in keratinocytes of the epidermis in 15 paired skin biopsies significantly decreased after treatment with erlotinib (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.0003, respectively). No significant change in Ki67 was detected in 15 tumors and no responses were observed. Only one of 15 tumors expressed EGFR, and this tumor displayed heterogeneous expression of the receptor. In the EGFR-positive tumor, levels of phospho-EGFR, phospho-MAPK, and phospho-AKT, but not Ki67, were reduced after treatment. We concluded that erlotinib had inhibitory biologic effects on normal surrogate tissues and in the one EGFR-positive tumor. The lack of reduced tumor proliferation may be attributed to the heterogeneous expression of EGFR in this patient and absence of an appropriate drug target in this cohort of heavily pretreated patients. In addition, 1 of 10 patients had an EGFR-positive tumor. Eroltinib down-regulated MMP-3 and collagen type 1 alpha 2. Gene changes in EGFR-negative tumors were attributable to those of G-protein linked and cell surface receptor linked signaling. Ixabepilone(NSC 710428), an investigational agent, is a semi-synthetic analog of the natural product epothilone B.',\n",

We have examined the variable regions of the porB gene from the 13 serotype strains expressing class 3 OMP, and have developed a panel of oligonucleotide probes for identification and classification of strains using genetic techniques. We have used this system of molecular analysis in several ongoing projects: 1) Molecular epidemiology of meningococcal meningitis in Brazil using PCR amplification of the porB gene directly from cerebrospinal fluid and subsequent genotyping using oligonucleotide probe hybridization. 2) Examination of serotype 15 strains obtained from cases of meningococcal disease among vaccine recipients and controls in the Norwegian outer membrane protein vaccine trial. 3) Epitope mapping of serotype 4 and serotype 21 monoclonal antibodies by comparison of antibody binding and variable region probe hybridization among a variety of type 4 and type 21 strains. 4) Investigation of an unusual strain sent to us from the CDC which binds both type 4 and type 15 Mabs. Using both probe hybridization and direct sequencing, we identified which regions of the porB gene from this strain were similar to each of the two prototype serotype strains We are currently investigating the antigenic properties of the class 3 OMP from this strain in rabbit immunization studies.

       " 'A sensitive HPLC method has been developed for the quantitation of polysaccharide (PS) in Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines. Hib PS is readily depolymerized in 0.1 N sodium hydroxide into its subunit. The major depolymerized product (82%) was isolated and characterized by composition analysis and 31P NMR to be a single repeating unit of the PS, ribitol-ribose-phosphate. The single repeating unit in NaOH-treated vaccines was analyzed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography using CarboPak PA-1 column and quantitated by pulsed amperometric detection. The PS contents of three conjugate vaccines and three PS vaccines from different manufacturers were determined. Their contents were in the ranges of expected values. This method is particularly useful for a vaccine with a sugar stabilizer such as lactose which would interfere with the colorimetric orcinol assay currently used for the determination of the PS. The HPLC method can quantitate 0.1 microg of the PS and its sensitivity is at least 30-fold higher than that of the orcinol assay. It may be used for stability studies of the conjugate vaccines since as little as 5% breakdown of PS from the PS-protein conjugates would be detected. ',\n",
       " 'A method was developed for coupling carboxylic acid-containing oligosaccharides (OS) to proteins. The OS was isolated from Neisseria meningitidis group A strain A1 lipooligosaccharide (LOS). This LOS has no human glycolipid-like lacto-N-neotetraose structure and contains multiple immunotypes including L8 found in group B and C strains. The carboxylic acid at 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid of the OS was linked through adipic acid dihydrazide to tetanus toxoid (TT). The molar ratio of the OS to TT in three conjugates ranged from 11:1 to 19:1. The antigenicity of the OS was conserved in these conjugates as measured by ELISA and inhibition ELISA with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to A1 LOS. These conjugates induced IgG antibodies to A1 LOS in mice and rabbits. The immunogenicity of the conjugates in rabbits was enhanced by using monophosphoryl lipid A plus trehalose dimycolate as an adjuvant. The resulting rabbit antisera cross-reacted with most of 12 prototype LOSs and with LOSs from two group B disease strains 44 76 and BB431 by ELISA and by Western blot which revealed a 3.6 KDa reactive band in these LOSs. The rabbit antisera showed bactericidal activity against the homologous strain A1, and the heterologous strains 44 76 and BB431. These results indicate that conjugates derived from A1 LOS can induce antibodies against many immunotype LOSs from different serogroup organisms including group B. OS- protein conjugates derived from meningococcal LOSs, therefore, may be a candidate vaccine to prevent meningitis caused by this pathogen. ',\n",
       " \"A number of pneumococcal polysaccharide (PS)- protein conjugate vaccines are in clinical studies. We have therefore continued studies on various aspects of antibody assay standardization. Different methods of coating the pneumococcal polysacccahrides to different polystyrene ELISA plates were compared and the optimum binding for each type PS was determined. Co-mixing with mHSA was found to be better for most types tested except for type 3 PS. Pre-coating wells with mHSA is best for type 3, because the specificity of antibodies binding were much more type 3 specific. Lot 89SF, the reference standard serum was therefore reassayed for this type. The IgG value was within 20% CV of that assigned by Lederle-Praxis research laboratories. Better inhibition also is achieved using this method of attachment. Column chromatography in Sephacryl S-500 for molecular sizing was done using several pneumococcal PS types including types 3, 4, 14, and the common C PS. Fractions were assayed by inhibition of binding to immune serum to C Ps and type PS. The phosphorous assay was performed as a marker for C PS. The C PS appears to be associated with the high molecular weight type PS's, and we are investigating whether the C PS is covalently bound to the type PS. Monoclonal antibodies to Types 9V, 14 and 3 are currently being used to study the multiplicity of epitopes present on a given PS. Phagocytosis assays will also be done to study correlation of pneumococcal antibodies to protection. \",\n",
       " 'Endotoxin (or lipopolysaccharide; LPS) is a main cause of lethal septic shock. Its toxicity is primarily mediated by the host overproduction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-(). Identifying agents that neutralize endotoxin and inhibit TNF-( production represents, therefore, a logical approach to prevention or treatment of the disease. To this end, we have used two independent assays (Limulus assay and TNF-( bioassay) to quantify the endotoxin-neutralizing activity of potential anti-LPS agents. Here we report a nonionic detergent Triton X-114 and a novel synthetic antibacterial peptide corresponding to the 33-mer at the N-terminus of human lactoferrin as new anti-LPS agents. The peptide inhibited Limulus coagulation and induction of TNF-a secretion by 4 different types of LPS and lipid A with equivalent or higher potency than polymyxin B. The anti-LPS potency of Triton X-114 was comparably lower than that of the peptide. The peptide neutralized LPS by binding to the lipid A portion. The first 6 residues (including 4 cationic residues) at the N-terminus of the peptide were crucial for the anti-LPS activity. The anti-LPS activity of Triton X-114 occurred above its critical micellization concentration (0.3 mM). Premixing of E.coli LPS (125 nanogram) with the peptide (2.5 microgram) or Triton X-114 (100 microgram) completely prevented the lethality resulting from endotoxic shock in the galactosamine-sensitized mouse model. Combination of the peptide with Triton X-114 gave a synergistic, significant protection even when they were injected intravenously 10 min after intraperitoneal injection of LPS. The protection was correlated with the reduction of the mouse serum TNF-a level. These results demonstrate the potential use of the lactoferrin-derived peptide and Triton X-114 as novel therapeutic agents against endotoxic shock. ',\n",
       " \"The major aim of this project is to develop and standardize an ELISA assay that measures IgG antibody to the Group B streptococcus (GBS) capsular polysaccharide (PS). In order to select the optimal assay, four published methods were compared for sensitivity and specificity. We choose to measure only IgG, because IgG antibodies are able to cross the placenta and provide protection for the newborn. Four of the GBS types, Ia, II, III and V, will be examined in these studies. To determine the best method for measuring specific IgG antibody to GBS PS, we are comparing four different ELISA methods to measure IgG antibody to GBS type III PS. The relative assay sensitivity was examined, and all four methods measured 0.1 ug ml or less of GBS-III PS antibody. Specificity of immune GBS-III antibody was evaluated for all the ELISA assays by competition inhibition assay using GBS and pneumococcal type PS's. Using 5 ug of type III PS, 100% inhibition was achieved for the mHSA method while the inhibition was approximately 85% for the biotin and HSA conjugated methods. We will also determine the specificity of all assays using non immune sera. The group specific PS antigen, common to all GBS types, purified from a nonencapsulated GBS strain did not inhibit type III binding. We are presently comparing the avidity of both vaccine induced and normal GBS type III antibodies using three ELISA methods. Since we are interested in measuring GBS IgG antibodies that are protective, we will determine which ELISA method best correlates with functional antibodies using opsonophagocytosis. \",\n",
       " 'Research was conducted to investigate the biosynthesis of pertussis toxin (PT) as well as the structure function relationships of the toxin. While the current dogma in the field is that only B. pertussis produces PT, recent clinical trials have provided provocative results which may suggest otherwise. A number of clinical investigators have reported that sera from children infected with either B. parapertussis or B. bronchiseptica can show antibody rises to PT. It has been known for some time that both B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica contain ptx genes but the genes were thought to be transcriptionally silent. We asked the question of whether the ptx genes of B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica could produce functionally active PT, if the genes were expressed. We constructed strains of both B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica which had the B. pertussis ptx promoter inserted immediately in front of the ptx- ptl regions of those strains. We found that both species produced active PT as well as at least certain of the Ptl proteins. The S2 subunit was confirmed to be prematurely terminated in B. parapertussis. Nonetheless, an active toxin was produced, although this toxin appeared to be more labile that PT. These results suggest that, if the ptx-ptl genes of B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica were expressed during the disease process, they would be functionally active and might contribute to pathogenesis. Moreover, these data illustrate that a significant number of amino acid changes can occur in PT without destroying biological activity. These results have implications for the future of acellular pertussis vaccines and suggest that we must remain vigilant to ensure that clinical isolates of B. pertussis do not exhibit alteration in PT sequence that might affect the efficacy of acellular pertussis vaccines that contain an inactivated form of this protein. We are currently using genetic and molecular biological techniques to determine whether the ptx genes of B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica are ever expressed in vitro or during the course of infection in vivo.

       " 'Tetanus toxin and botulinum toxins are neurotoxins which have similar structures and modes of action. The toxicity of both of these toxins results from proteolytic cleavage of so-called SNARE proteins. While inactivated forms of the proteins are used as vaccines, botulinum toxin is being used more as a therapeutic against disease involving muscle spasms. The work on this project is directed toward defining how tetanus toxin action blocks the targeting and fusion of intracellular transport vesicles. As a model system, tetanus toxin action is being studied for CHO cells which lack receptor for the toxin using a chimera of tetanus enzymatic domain and anthrax receptor domain. While the chimera is cytotoxic for CHO cells it is not active toward the expected SNARE protein, VAMP. Efforts are underway to identify isoforms of VAMP in CHO cells which may explain this phenomenon. ',\n",
       " 'The current diphtheria epidemic in the former Soviet Union has resulted in a heightened interest in the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent diphtheria. With the exception of diphtheria toxin, no studies have been done to identify virulence determinants in this important bacterial pathogen. Additionally, little is known on how C. diphtheriae invades, colonizes and survives within the human host. The acquisition of iron is an important virulence determinant for many bacterial pathogens, and numerous virulence factors including diphtheria toxin are regulated by iron. In the current study, C. diphtheriae was examined for the capability to utilize various host compounds as iron sources. C. diphtheriae C&(-) acquired iron from heme, hemoglobin, and transferrin. A siderophore uptake mutant of strain C7 was unable to utilize transferrin, but was unaffected in acquisition of iron from heme and hemoglobin which suggests that C. diphtheriae possesses a novel mechanism for utilizing heme and hemoglobin as iron sources. Mutants of C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans that are defective in acquiring iron from heme and hemoglobin were isolated. A clone obtained from a C&(-) genomic plasmid library complemented several of the C. ulcernas and C. diphtheriae mutants. The nucleotide sequence of the gene (humO) required for complementation was determined, and it was revealed that the predicted product, HmuO, has 33% identity and 70% similarity with the human heme oxygenase enzyme HO-1. It is proposed that the HmuO protein is essential for the utilizatino of heme as an iron source by C. diphtheriae and that the heme oxygenase activity of HmuO is involved in the release of iron from heme. This is the first report of a bacterial gene that has homology to heme oxygenases. ',\n",
       " 'The expression of virulence factors in the bacterium Bordetella pertussis is regulated in an environmentally responsive fashion under the control of the two-component system encoded by the bvgAS locus. In recent years we have focused research efforts on understanding the mechanisms of gene regulation in this important human pathogen - specifically focussing on the genes encoding pertussis toxin (ptx) and filamentous hemagglutinin (fha). Within the past year we have elucidated some details regarding the interaction of the BvgA response regulator protein with RNA polymerase at the promoters for these virulence genes. We have studied DNA-binding of BvgA and mutants which either do not express the ptx genes, or which express them at elevated levels and have documented their activities in in vitro transcription assays. In addition we have examined interactions of BvgA with RNA polymerase, both genetically, by isolating mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase which affect virulence gene regulation, and biochemically, by determining which amino acids on the alpha subunit contact BvgA at the ptx and fha promoters. Interestingly, these contacts appear to differ at the two promoters. Other studies in the laboratory have addressed the genomic structure of natural isolates of B. pertussis from a recent outbreak. We found that gene order in the chromosomes of these strains was variable. ',\n",
       " \"Many bacterial pathogens of the intestinal tract have as an early and necessary step in initiation of disease the ability to penetrate gut epithelial cells. My lab's work in the early 1980's established that Shigella's genetic machinery to trigger invasion is encoded on a large virulence-associated plasmid. More recent studies have shown that the invasion ability of other enteric bacteria is chromosomally encoded. This project is aimed at understanding the prokaryotic and eukaryotic requirements for bacterial internalization, with the ultimate aim being a thorough molecular definition of the events involved in bacterial invasion of eukaryotic tissues. Current experimental approaches involve the use of assays measuring bacterial entry into cultured lines of human epithelial cells of various tissue origins. Biochemical inhibitors of prokaryotic structure function or of eukaryotic cell processes are employed in these tissue culture invasion assays to examine the requirements for bacterial uptake. Direct visualization of bacterial entry is measured via transmission electron microscopy, video microscopy, fluorescent microscopy, and confocal microscopy. In addition to the mechanistic approaches described above, genetic techniques are employed to clone the responsible bacterial genes. Eukaryotic receptors for bacterial ligands and specific eukaryotic cell responses to bacterial invasion are measured via inhibitor competition assays, ligand binding assays, and mRNA analyses of infected eukaryotic cells. The information gained from each of these approaches is integrated to provide a mechanistic understanding of bacterial entry for each pathway studied. \",\n",
       " 'These studies are directed at utilizing specific cloned virulence gene regions of Shigella as DNA probes or their sequence information in polymerase chain reaction assays to detect Shigella in stools. Our early studies showed that DNA probes were very sensitive, quick, and effective in detecting Shigella in the stool of diarrheal disease patients in Peru. In more recent studies utilizing polymerase chain reaction analysis of stools of healthy (i.e. asymptomatic) nonhuman primates and their healthy human caretakers, we have found a high rate of chronic, low level( i.e. below bacteriologic detection) asymptomatic carriage of Shigella. Our specific objectives are to determine (1) if these Shigella have full virulence potential,(2) the exact state in which Shigella are residing in these carriers( e.g. inside mucosal epithelial cells in the colon), (3) the immune status of the carrier to Shigella, and (4) if this chronic low level carrier state is responsible for maintaining Shigella endemicity in the U.S. where there are now over 25,000 cases per year.

       " 'Genetic and biochemical studies of Escherichia coli over the past 5 years have revealed novel mutations, termed adaptive mutational events, that occur at high frequency (i.e. generally 3 to 5 logs higher than mutations occurring during logarithmic growth), only under special adaptive conditions, and in the stationary phase of bacterial growth. Our recent studies of Shigella indicate that this organism also undergoes adaptive mutations in a large variety of oligosaccharide utilization pathways and in other metabolic and virulence gene regions. This project is aimed at characterizing genetically and biochemically adaptive mutational events in Shigella at various metabolic and virulence gene loci for frequency and chemical nature. Involved loci will be DNA sequenced to examine the precise nature of the mutational event, with an emphasis on understanding the mechanisms involved in stimulating these high frequency ( e.g. 10-3) mutational events in stationary phase cells. Similar studies of other related enteric bacteria will be conducted to determine if adaptive mutations are a cause of misidentification of pathogens, via altered biochemical pathways, or a method by which bacteria modulate their virulence.

       " \"Brain damage due to intrauterine perinatal virus infection is a significant congenital health problem. In addition, the CNS continues to develop during the first year of postnatal life, providing for continued susceptibility of the infant CNS to damage by viral infection after birth. Since the developing nervous system is uniquely sensitive to damage following virus infection, administering neurovirulent vaccines to infants also places the child's CNS at increased risk for injury. However, little is known about specific cellular components that support preferential replication of neurovirulent wild type and vaccine viruses in neuronal cells. Wild type mumps virus, and some strains of mumps vaccine virus (Urabe Am9, Leningrad 3), are among the most neurotropic of the early childhood viruses, and new MMR combinations continue to be proposed that include new strains of mumps vaccine virus. Thus, identification of the specific cellular characteristics that lead to enhanced susceptibility to damage by neurovirulent viruses will lead to the development of molecular biological, in vitro and or small animal models of neurovirulence. Development of these non-simian models will lead to cost saving and improved predictability of neurovirulence testing. Identification of intracellular and cell surface molecules responsible for susceptibility to neurovirulent wild type and vaccine viruses will also provide information to help genetically engineer non-neurovirulent vaccine virus strains. Notably, information obtained in these studies about mumps virus vaccines will likely be useful in generalizing to other potentially neurovirulent vaccines (e.g., measles, Japanese encephalitis). Previous studies comparing virus growth in neuronal and non neuronal cell lines have suffered from problems related to the comparison of virus replication in cells of different lineage, strain and, sometimes, species. We have a human cell line (NT2) that can be differentiated from fibroblastic to neuronal cell type using retinoic acid. By comparing virus replication in these cells before and after differentiation to neuronal cell type, we can identify specific cell features important in neurovirulence using only one human cell line. Before and after differentiation, NT2 cells will be infected with parent or neurovirulent variants of non-neurovirulent (e.g., Jeryl Lynn vaccine), or parent or non-neurovirulent variants of neurovirulent (e.g., Kilham wild type) vaccine and wild type mumps virus. Differences in virus replication (e.g., binding of virus, titer of infectious virions, and viral proteins and RNA) will be compared between wild type and vaccine viruses and their variants before (fibroblastic) and after (neuronal) differentiation. Cell surface analysis, cell fractionation experiments and gel shift analysis will be used to identfy specific cellular components that interact with neurovirulent viruses before and after neuronal differentiation of cells. Once specific neuron-linked cell components that support neurovirulent virus replication are identified, we will identify the viral sequences responsible for this interaction. Using this information, virus vaccines can be developed with altered neurovirulence sequences to generate safer vaccines. \",\n",

Notably, the information obtained in these studies will not only be useful for the development of non-neurovirulent mumps vaccines, but will likely be generalizable to other potentially neurovirulent vaccines (e.g., measles, Japanese encephalitis). We study the mechanisms by which wild type and vaccine strains of mumps virus selectively target the central nervous system and may cause damage the developing infant brain. Vaccine and wild type mumps strains are passaged in inbred neonatal rats in order to study anatomical damage to areas of the brain that undergo postnatal development (e.g., cerebellum and hippocampus). Mechanisms responsible for this damage are evaluated, including the death and functional damage to neurons and other brain cells, changes in expression of surface molecules and neurotrophin secretion important in neuronal migration and growth, and inflammatory mediators (e.g. cytokines, chemokines). Behavioral correlates of this damage are measured by specific neurobehavioral testing (e.g., activity levels, motor skills, spatial learning and memory). Neurovirulent revertants of non-neurovirulent and non-neurovirulent revertants of neurovirulent vaccine and wild type mumps virus will undergo sequence analysis to identify molecular genetic correlates of neurovirulence. Jeryl-Lynn (JL, vaccine strain, non-neurovirulent) has been plaque purified to two plaque phenotypes (small and large plaques). The JL vaccine will be passaged in neonatal Lewis rat brain, and the animals will be studied at each passage to identify the growth of a neurovirulent variant. The neurovirulent variant and nonneurovirulent parent strain will undergo sequence comparison to identify genomic changes associated with neurovirulence. Correlation between genomic changes and specific neuroanatomical and behavioral damage will be identified and mechanisms for this damage elucidated. \",\n",
       " 'In adult women polyarthraliga and arthritis are common complications associated with Rubella live virus vaccine. We have recently showed that cellular autoantigens (calreticulin and La) are necessary for RV replication and interact with cis-acting elements of RV RNA. Antibodies to autoantigen RNP complexes are commonly found in autoimmune diseases. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to devise new strategies for developing rubella vaccine which is free of such adverse reactions. We are constructing a RV infectious plasmid that has altered sites regions that interact with either calreticulin or La antigens. This infectious RNA can replicate at suboptimal level and be eliminated by dilution effect after a few cycles of replication. Further such a \"replication-crippled\" RV vaccine can invoke immune response and not result in vaccine related adverse reactions. We will test such a vaccinefor safety and efficacy in monkeys and eventually be used in humans. Our research deals with understanding the molecular mechanism of adverse reactions associated with rubella virus. We have for the first time showed that host autoantigens are necessary for replication of live virus in the cell. Autoantigen interaction with RV RNA can result in the generating autoimmune response which could cause arthritic symptoms associated with RV vaccine. Research dealing with the development of recombinant rubella vaccine will have significant impact on our understanding of the safety of currently licensed live virus vaccines as well as advising manufacturers in the development of future viral vaccines. Outcome of this research will have added impact on the development of assays and methodologies that are useful in evaulating the purity of biologics during manufacturing process and lot release testing. It will also provide impetus in the development of streamlining regulatory policy to evaluate manufacturing process for recombinant viral vaccines. ',\n",
       " 'Group A rotaviruses (RV) are the major etiologic agents of severe dehydrating diarrhea in children under 5 years age, leading to 870, 000 deaths annually in the developing world. One potential cause of virus-related adverse reactions is due to the interaction of certain host proteins with the viral nonstructural proteins and or nucleic acids. Often the outcome of virus-host interaction determines the viral pathogenesis, persistence and host range. RV has the ability to establish persistent infection like the other members of reovirus family and orbiviruses. In addition, one of the viral nonstructural proteins, (NSP4) is known to cause cell death by interacting with host protein(s) another NS protein, NSP1, determines the host range.Thus the objective of the proposed study is to initiate investigations into the molecular pathogenesis of RV to identify and characterize the host factors that interact with viral nonstructural proteins to establish their role in the viral replication persistence and possible adverse reactions. Understanding the mechanism by which the host factors (proteins) determine rotaviral replication, host range and pathogenicity would help evaluating the safety and efficacy of rotaviral vaccines, as well as potential adverse reactions. Further, to address the possible adverse reactions following the public use of the candidate vaccines, there is a need for setting-up an infrastructure for the rotavirus research in our division (DVP). This would complement and enhance the lab-based review of RV vaccines for safety and efficacy. ',\n",

(3) Major Findings: - Our study demonstrated that HIV-1 mediated cell fusion and syncytia formation followed different kinetics. Furthermore, fusion occurred unde conditions (i.e. cell ratios) which did not favor syncytia formation (similar to the in vivo situation). - This assay was used to re-examine the role played by the adhesion molecules LFA-1 ICAM-1 during HIV-1 env-mediated cell fusion. It was foun that the LFA-1 adhesion molecules do not play a role during the early events of HIV-1 env-mediated cell fusion, but do contribute to later events leading to syncytia formation. - We also studied the fusion between human B cell lines end HIV-1 env- expressing cells. We identified a fusion mechanism which is initiated by CD4-gp120 interactions, but greatly enhanced by the Ig receptors on B cells, providing they bind to the CD4-binding-region on the gp120 envelope. This study provides a mechanism for the selective fusion and elimination of B-cells expressing anti-gp120 Ab receptors. - Currently, we are studying a new receptor required for HIV-1 fusion which can be down-modulated by the PKC activator, phorbol ester (PMA).

Both PCR and biological assays were used. (3) Major findings: - Antibodies generated in mice against gp120-Ba and against V3-Ba were foun to be predominantly of the IgG 2a 2b subclasses. They neutralized several HIV-1 lab strains in a syncytia inhibition assay. - From a safety point of view, Ba or its LPS are much less toxic to animal than E.

       " 'Chimpanzees can be infected with HIV-1; however, since this species is endangered their maintenance cost is very high and the number of animals limited for experimental research. Thus a better model is sought. We have pursued HIV- 1 infection in pig-tailed macaques. Initially, we infected 2 monkeys with LAV LAI, a laboratory strain of HIV-1 and 2 monkeys with a primary isolate of HIV-1. Analysis of the LAV-inoculated monkeys indicated that both monkeys were infected and contain viral sequences long-term. Current studies are underway to pursue host factors and viral determinants which control the establishment of infection, the level of virus production and the eventual progression to disease. The results from such studies will hopefully enable the pig-tailed monkeys to become a useful animal model for human AIDS. In addition, analysis of HIV-1 primary isolates in monkeys is also being carried out. Since the latter are representative of the natural infection in people, an animal model utilizing primary isolates will be valuable for the development and safety testing of effective HIV-1 vaccine(s) and therapeutic(s). There is a current epidemic of human AIDS. Major efforts and resources have been directed towards development of vaccines and therapeutics against HIV-1 and AIDS. The availability of a non-human primate model for AIDS is critical for evaluating the safety and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics developed for human AIDS intervention and treatment. Furthermore, an animal model for HIV-1 infection will enable a better understanding of the mechanism of virus infection and development of disease. This information will provide better review of product submitted to FDA for evaluation. ',\n",
       " 'Murine retrovirus-based packaging cell systems have been shown to spontaneously and sporadically generate infectious murine retroviruses (RCRs). Such viruses possess a broad host range and can infect a wide variety of primate cells including human. Thus, rigorous and sensitive testing is currently required by the FDA for manufacturers to evaluate potential contamination of gene therapy products for murine retroviruses. We initiated studies to evaluate the potential risk of RCRs in primates. Rhesus monkeys were inoculated with an RCR preparation and blood and tissue samples were taken regularly to monitor for retroviral infection. Our results indicated that normal, juvenile monkeys could be infected with RCR. Although infectious virus could only be isolated early post-inoculation, retroviral sequences have persisted over 1 year . We are currently investigating host and viral factors which may activate the latent sequences and its consequences on the host monkey. Retroviral-based gene therapy is an effective delivery system for a therapeutic gene. However, replication-competent retroviruses (RCRs) have been shown to arise spontaneously and sporadically from such packaging cell systems. Due to the infectivity of RCRs in primate cells, including human cells, there is an increased safety concern regarding retroviral-based gene therapy products. Thus the FDA has required rigorous and highly sensitive testing of these products. To support these extensive and fairly expensive requirements, we undertook to evaluate potential risk of RCRs in primates using a monkey model system. Our results have thus far indicated that even normal monkeys can be infected with a relatively low amount of RCR thus confirming the FDA position on the testing requirements. Current work is directed towards long-term effects of potential infection of RCR in primate cells. These studies have also led to development of sensitive assays for RCR testing and guidelines for patient monitoring. ',\n",
       " 'Because the virus that causes AIDS, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is almost always lethal, the development of attenuated virus vaccines for AIDS presents serious medical, scientific, and ethical issues. For example, a major concern would be the possibility, albeit theoretical, that an attenuated HIV may revert to a pathogenic form and thus cause disease. One approach that has been explored in the monkey model system for AIDS has been to attenuate the virus by deleting some of the genes not obligatorily required for virus replication. We are pursuing this approach for HIV, and as a first step are trying to determine how these genes are functioning during the life cycle of the virus. It is clear that in the future the FDA will have to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of several live vaccines against HIV, and it is likely that attenuated HIV will be among them. Thus, our work will directly assist in this assessment. In addition, the genes that are likely to be deleted in any attenuated HIV vaccine are also themselves likely to be targets for future therapeutics, and therefore our work on their function will be pertinent to this aspect as well.

       " 'We are trying to understand why certain HIV isolates enter and infect some cell types but not others. For example, some HIV isolates are able to infect primary T cells, while others are able to infect both primary T cells and macrophages; some isolates have the capacity to induce the formation of large multinuclear cells (syncytia) while others cannot. Furthermore, we have found that certain viruses can alter their biological characteristics by passage in tissue culture, and the genetic changes that permit this to occur are in the HIV envelope, the protein involved in the initial binding and uptake of the virus. Thus, part of the understanding of HIV tropism involves understanding the biochemical events involved in virus binding and uptake. Because binding and entry is not the whole story of viral tropism, we are investigating determinants of tropism in other regions of the viral genome. Our work involves using assays to measure virus growth, virus amounts, and virus neutralization. A familiarity with these assays and methods is important to the FDA review process, where such assays are used to ascertain the efficacy of vaccines against HIV. ',\n",
       " 'Development of Antisense HIV-1 Plasmid DNA (M. Shahabuddin and T. Bryan). In an effort to achieve efficient and long-term inhibition of viral replication and propagation, we have engineered a recombinant plasmid DNA containing several genes of HIV-1, that can trancribe antisense RNAs. HIV-1 pNL4-3 DNA was used for the construction of the recombinant antisense plasmid DNA. Intitial studies to evaluate effect of the antisense DNA against HIV-1 were performed by co-transfecting various concentrations of the anti-sense DNA with infectious viral DNA into 293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line, by the calcium phospate procedure. The results indicated inhibition of RT acitivty from the infectious HIV-1 DNA due to the presence of the antisense DNA. Studies are ongoing to evaluate the inhibitory effect of the recombinant anti-sense DNA in infected cells using primary HIV-1 isolates as well.Development of an HIV-1 DNA Vaccine (T. A. Galvin). The most commonly used promoter in HIV-1 vaccine plasmid DNAs are from MMTV and CMV. DNA vaccines using these promoters to express HIV-1 genes have not resulted in successful high-level and long-term immune responses. We have constructed an HIV-1 plasmid DNA containing the gag and env genes from pNL4-3 DNA and a murine retroviral promoter enhancer. The in vitro analysis of a variety of cells transfected with the HIV-1 vaccine DNA construct indicates: correct size RNAs are transcribed from the construct by Northern blot analysis; viral proteins by Western blot analysis; and particle formation by EM. Studies are ongoing to analyze the immune responses of the HIV DNA construct in vivo in mice and monkeys. ',\n",
       " 'Biological products including vaccines and therapeutics can potentially become contaminated by retroviruses primarily from the cell substrate due to the presence of endogenous retroviral sequences which reside as a part of the host genome. In some cases infectious virus may arise due to induction of an infectious, latent virus or by generation of a novel virus via recombination between endogenous viral sequences. Thus retrovirus detection assays need to be used for demonstrating the absence of known as well as novel retroviral contaminants in the cell substrate and products. Furthermore, mammalian organs tissues which can be used in xenotransplantation protocols must also be demonstrated free of infectious agents. We have directed our initial efforts towards standardization and utilization of the reverse transcriptase (RT) assay which is a relatively simple, quick and inexpensive assay for the general detection of retroviruses. Although not highly sensitive this assay is useful for the detection of known and novel retroviruses. We assessed the sensitivity and reproducibility of a new RT assay for the detection of HIV-1 and SIV. Our data indicates that the new RT assay is 10-fold better than a published RT assay (Willey, et al., 1988) in a 2-hour incubation period. The new RT assay can be useful for direct detection of retroviruses in virus isolation studies as well as for screening biological products for viral contaminants, subsequent to amplification thru susceptible cells. We are currently optimizing RT assays for the detection of other retroviruses including simian retroviruses which can potentially contaminate vaccines grown in monkey cell substrates. Current efforts are also directed towards developing and optimizing infectivity assays for the detection of potential retroviruses which may arise in primate cell substrates or in simian tissues used in xenotranplantation. Our present focus is simian foamy virus (SFV) which is widespread in monkeys and has a broad tropism for mamalian and avian cells. We have discovered that SFV can replicate very efficiently in Mus dunni cells. We have compared the replication kinetics of SFV in Mus dunni cells with its growth in other currently used cell lines for SFV replication, including dog, monkey and human cell lines. Our data based upon CPE and RT analysis indicate that SFV replicates most efficiently in Mus dunni cells. Thus these cells may be useful for the detection of SFV contamination in biological materials. We are also developing sensitive PCR assays for the direct detection of SFV in tissues. This approach will be used to evaluate the potential risk of SFV infection in man by studying SFV infection and interaction with other retroviruses using a monkey model. ',\n",
       " \"These studies focus on the safety of vaccine and protein immunogens. We are interested in learning what forms of immunization can initiate, perpetuate or magnify autoimmune responses. Our work uses normal and disease-prone animals to monitor the effect of various vaccines on autoantibody production and disease severity. We are also interested in learning what changes in immune system function contribute to the development of systemic autoimmunity. Thus, we are analyzing the effect of cytokines and sex hormones on the level and type of immune activation in normal individuals and those with autoimmune disease. Finally, our lab is examining potential therapies for established autoimmune disease. A critical element in the assessment of vaccine safety is their potential to induce or augment the development of autoimmune disease. Our studies are directed towards identifying those factors that are responsible for eliciting systemic autoimmunity. In addition, our studies of patients with lupus are of particular importance to the FDA Office of Woman's Health, which selected this project for support. \",\n",

Our research is directed towards understanding i) the mechanism by which the new form of vaccine induces a protective immune response, ii) whether such vaccines can induce deleterious autoimmune responses and iii) whether such vaccines induce protective immunity or tolerance when administered to newborns. DNA vaccines represent the cutting edge in vaccine development. A number of INDs for DNA vaccines have already been submitted to CBER, and considerably more are under active development. The FDA critically needs expertise in this field, including an understanding of the benefits, mode of action, and potential side effects of DNA vaccination. ',\n",
       " 'We are establishing, modifying, and developing at CBER sensitive assays for the detection of retroviruses. With the recent publication of three extremely sensitive assays to measure reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and the finding that certain licensed vaccines contain RT activity, it became necessary that CBER set up and investigate these assays biochemically in order to ascertain what precisely they were measuring. Because RT is usually associated with a retroviral particle, it was possible that those vaccines in which RT activity was found were contaminated with low amounts of a retrovirus whose presence was only revealed by the new and more sensitive assays. In fact, these sensitive RT assays do detect minor activities of cellular enzymes, and part of our program at CBER is to develop assays capable of discriminating between the two. This will be important in order to be able interpret any positive signals found in biological products destined for human and veterinary use. Our work involves using applying and developing assays to measure the presence of very low levels of retrovirus contamination in vaccines and cell substrates. The use of such methods is critical to the mission of the FDA in ensuring the safety of the products we regulate. Because of the ever-present possibility that new viruses that are pathogenic to humans will emerge, it should be obvious to all that CBER must be able to respond quickly to contingencies as they arise. To do this, it is necessary to have in-house expertise capable of applying, modifying, and developing new assays. ',\n",
       " \"Both proliferative and CTL responses of patients with chronic HCV infections to peptide antigens and antigens expressed by recombinant DNA systems.Several CTL epitopes have been defined in the core protein, NS3,NS4 and NS5. CTL responses to these epitopes are being investigated in patients to understand the relationship of CTL to the pathogenesis of hepatitis C.It is important to know if these CTL responses are related to disease induction or to recovery from. A new HLA A2 restricted CTL epitope CTL epitpope was identified in the NS3 protein. This epitpoe was found by a novel technique that did not require synthesis of peptides nor prediction based on known A2 motifs. This epitope indeed was not a known A2 motif. Naked DNA vaccines expressing all the structural genes and the NS3 gene have been prepared and shown to be antigenic in mice. The hypervariable region has also been studied as a source of T cell epitopes ad a helper epitope has been identified in a relatively conserved region of the so called hypervariable region. This helper epitope may be important in regulating the immune response to that region. New approaches to in vitro neutralization are being studied including a binding assay for HCV envelope glycoproteins to cells, reduction in viral replication as measured by CTL assays usiing specific T cell lines and detection of intracellular HCV enzyme systems as a measure of HCV replication. Several of these assays should also be useful for antiviral screening. Hepatitis C is a major public health problem for which control is at a preliminary stage. CBER is actively involved in the licensing of new diagnostic tests that can be used to improve the screening of blood and source plasma. CBER ihas responsibility for biologic based therapeuticssuch as interferon. Experimental vaccines have already been described and the first IND's are expected shortly. Therapeutic vaccines based on CTL epitopes are also being actively pursued by several laboratories and companies. Understanding the immunobiology of hepatitis C has a direct relationship to the products that we have already licensed and are presently reviewing for screening blood and plasma products as well as therapeutics that have been licensed and are under review such as interferons. Again understanding the immunology of HCV infections and immunopathogenesis will be vitally important for our reviews of these projects. \",\n",
       " 'Research on Hepatitis C (HC) has followed several lines. Following cloning and sequencing the genome of the H strain of HCV, we have constructed a putative full length cDNA clone of the genome. We have been evaluating tha clone in cell culture systems as well as by direct transfection of RNA transcripts of this clone into chimpanzee liver. To date this clone has no proved to be infectious and we are in the process of modifying it with the hopes of having an infectious clone. Using recombinant baculovirus expresse protein we are developing an anti-HCV core specific for IgM. We hope to us such an assay to distinguish between patients who have recovered from patients who are asymptomatic but chronically infected. Such an assay may also prove useful in following patients on treatment protocols. In collaboration with C. Rice we have characterized the NS3 protease, identified the enzymatic active site, determined the processing of the entire HCV polyprotein and determined the precise cleavage sites of the NS3 protease. We have shown that all the cleavages downstream of the NS3 are performed by that protease, that all the cleavages in the structural protei region are performed by host peptidase probably signalase. However the cleavage between NS2 and NS3 was not performed by either signalase or the NS3 protease. Viral proteases may serve as targets for antiviral drugs and since the NS3 is a rather typical trypsin-like serine protease, inhibitors may not be viral specific. The NS2 protease however seems to be unique and therefore may be sensitive to specific inhibitors. We also have very preliminary evidence for further processing of the core protein that may be an autocatalytic event similar to what has been found in pestiviruses. We have a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the entire open reading frame of the HCV genome which we will evaluate in the chimpanzee model as a potential vaccine. ',\n",
       " 'Expression of the approximately 70 herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genes is regulated primarily at the level of mRNA transcription, and can be conveniently divided into three phases based on the temporal order of mRNA synthesis. Immediate-early genes are expressed soon after virus infection, and their gene products are required for the expression of early genes, many of whose gene products are involved in viral DNA replication. Expression of viral late genes requires viral DNA replication and functional immediate-early gene products. Understanding the regulation of HSV gene expression is necessary for the development and evaluation of successful vaccines. In addition, the development of HSV as a gene therapy vector requires an understanding of the regulation of foreign gene expression in HSV vectors. One aspect of this research project is designed to study the temporal expression of herpes simplex type 1 late genes, those genes expressed only after viral DNA replication. Most of the products of these genes are structural proteins of the virion and include at least 15 glycoproteins and 7 different capsid proteins. Extensive mutational analysis of the promoter regions of several glycoprotein genes has identified three separate sequence elements that are involved in expression. These elements are interchangeable from one promoter to another, and include a TATA element, an initiator-like region at the start of transcription, and a downstream element necessary for maximal expression. Currently, we are investigating the function of the initiator region and the downstream activation region by construction of hybrid viral promoters containing similar regions from other eukaryotic promoters. A second aspect of this work investigates the expression of foreign genes in herpes simplex vectors. Currently, we are investigating the use of the HIV LTR as an inducible promoter for foreign gene expression in an HSV vector. Foreign genes under the control of the LTR in an HSV vector are inducible by the HIV Tat regulatory protein which suggests that this promoter may be useful for regulated expression of therapeutic genes in HIV infected cells. The third aspect of this research project is designed to evaluate various HSV gene products as potential components of subunit vaccines. Expression plasmids have been made that express different HSV glycoproteins and these are being used for direct injection into mice to determine which proteins or combinations of proteins provide optimal protection against HSV infection.

       " 'Poxviruses provide a unique system for studying the replication of DNA. Required enzymes and factors are encoded within the viral genome and DNA synthesis and processing occurs within the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell. Therefore, it has been possible to apply genetic and biochemical approaches to the study of DNA replication. Our effort has been directed towards ascertaining the structure and mode of replication of the poxvirus genome with particular emphasis placed on understanding the processing of the replicative intermediates including the telomere-like hairpin structure and the enzymes involved in its replication. The replication of vaccinia virus proceeds through concatemeric intermediates that are resolved into unit length DNA molecules. Mutational analysis has demonstrated that a cis acting DNA sequence highly conserved among poxviruses as well as the palindromic structure of the concatemer is essential for resolution and that resolution occurs by a process involving conservative strand exchange. A model for resolution involving site-specific recombination and oriented branch migration is consistent with this data. Our present efforts are directed towards determining the trans acting protein components that participate in resolution. We have identified one open reading frame in vaccinia that encodes for a gene with homology to site-specific recombination proteins. This gene is essential for viral growth, synthesized in small amounts after DNA replication, and myristilated. Presently we are trying to determine the function of this gene during vaccinia virus replication. We have also detected an activity in virion extracts that cleaves and cross-links DNA. This activity is dependent on DNA structure, independent of ATP and metal ion concentrations and is similar to reactions observed for other proteins that process DNA structures. We are attempting to purify and identify the protein responsible for this activity and investigate its role in vaccinia virus DNA processing. ',\n",

The capacity to incorporate large amounts of DNA coupled with their wide host range allows for the expression and correct processing of a great variety of proteins in many cell lines. High level expression vectors have been constructed by expressing bacteriophage RNA polymerase genes in vaccinia. These vectors express high levels of any gene located behind the bacteriophage promoter. We have developed a conditionally lethal vaccinia virus which expresses the T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase. Under the restrictive conditions of elevated temperature the virus undergoes an abortive infection where greatly reduced amounts of the vaccinia late or post-replicative genes are synthesized. We are quantitating the absolute level of expression of foriegn genes in this system and comparing its utility to presently available vaccinia T7 expression systems.

       " 'In the first section we describe mutagenesis of the proposed substrate binding domains of the viral protease NS3. Last year we described the construction of an infectious full-length cDNA clone of DEN2, and further characterization of this clone is described in the middle section. Finally, we describe the introduction of selected mutations in NS2B into the DEN2 genome. Mutagenesis of NS3. Two of the four domains in NS3 with sequence homology to trypsin-like serine proteases (\"homology boxes\" 3 and 4) contain residues predicted to be important for substrate binding (aa 1604, 1605, 1625, 1627 and 1628). We have begun a limited mutagenesis of some of the residues in these two boxes in order to characterize their requirement for protease activity and to identify mutants with partial cleavage defects. To date, 34 mutations have been analyzed. Most mutations in box 4, including those in aa 1625, 1627, and 1628, abolish protease activity. This is consistent with the hypothesis that box 4 forms part of the substrate-binding pocket. In contrast, many of the mutations in box 3, including those in aa 1604 and 1605, retain significant protease activity, even wild-type activity in a few cases. Surprisingly, asp 1604, predicted to contact a positively charged residue at the cleavage site, can be changed to lys or arg with significant residual activity. Analogous mutations in trypsin abolish cleavage. Other mutations in box 3, clustered around the catalytic serine, abolish protease activity. This confirms that some resisues in box 3 are important for protease function, but is inconsistent with the proposed role for aa 1604 and 1605 in substrate binding. Control mutations outside of the homology boxes were well-tolerated. Our plan is to introduce some of the mutations in NS3 which permit significant residual protease activity back into the dengue genome, in an effort to confirm the observed effect on protease function and possibly to attenuate the virus. Characterization of the DEN2 infectious clone. By plaquing directly after RNA transfection we find that the specific infectivity of transcripts is 10-100 fold less than virion RNA. The DNA sequence of our infectious clone was determined, and found to differ from our lab strain by only two silent mutations, one of which had been put in intentionally to create a restriction site. Thus, we presume the reduced specific infectivity of transcripts vs virion RNA is caused by errors during transcription of the 11 kb template and or inefficient capping. Introduction of mutations in NS2B into the infectious clone. A series of mutants were made in which increasing portions of DEN2 NS2B was replaced by DEN4 NS2B. Only the mutant with the least amount of DEN4 NS2B grew at all, and it grew slowly and made small plaques. We plan to further characterize this mutant with regard to its growth properties in cells and in animal models. ',\n",

(2) Interaction of the flavivirus C with other viral proteins during virion morphogenesis. Full-length chimeric D2 cDNAs containing appropriate mutations of the internal hydrophobic domain in the D2 C were constructed. The internal hydrophobic domain in C was shown to be strictly required for virus replication. Substitution of Arg 55 by hydrophobic aas, including Leu, was lethal in the context of D2 replication. We infer that Leu in the YF sequence context is required for interaction of C with another YF protein during virion morphogenesis.(3) Effects of mutations in the 3\\'-SL on replication of dengue-2 virus. Flavivirus genomic RNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure (3\\'-SL) within the 3\\'-noncoding region. A mutant containing a substitution of the 3\\'-terminal 7 nt of the D2 sequence by analogous WN nts, was severely restricted for growth in mosquito cells. This is a desireable property of a live, attenuated vaccine virus, and this mutation is being incorporated into vaccine candidate mutant viruses. INDs exist for the development of new live, attenuated virus vaccines against several flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and arenaviruses. These are all positive-stranded RNA viruses that employ analogous mechanisms of replication involving the processing of a polycistronic protein or \"polyprotein\" precursor. Our studies of possible attenuating mutations in the dengue virus genome aid in the critical analysis of these potential new products, as well as being relevant to the development of a live dengue virus vaccine in our laboratory and adding to scientific knowledge of the biology of flaviviruses. We are interested in determining the effects of mutations upon replication of dengue virus in the context of our full-length \"infectious\" cDNA copy of the dengue-2 genome. In this way we hope to develop attenuated mutant viruses that might be useful in vaccine development and or in understanding dengue virus virulence. ',\n",

Using immunoelectron microscopy we have found that transfection of the MHC Class I H-2Kb, but not the Class II H-2IAk gene results in the virtual elimination of two actively produced endogenous retroviruses, a budding ecotropic C-type particle and an intracellular intracisternal A-type particle (IAP). In H-2Kb-positive cells, the loss of IAP was due to a lack of IAP-specific mRNA while the loss of C-type retroviral particles was associated with deletions in their proviral DNA. b) Transfection of the MHC Class I H- 2Kb gene into cells of a pigmented subclone of the B16-F10 melanoma cell line results in the loss of melanin production. Electron microscopy showed that melanosomes, the organelles in which melanin is synthesized, were completely absent in transfected cells. Northern blot analysis showed that transfected cells lacked mRNA for the critical tyrosinase enzyme as well as mRNA for the Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone receptor. Expression of the H-2Kb gene in BL6 melanoma cells thus results in down- regulation of the entire melanogenic pathway including the inhibition of tyrosinase and MSH receptor gene expression and melanosomal biogenesis.

       " 'Last year we reported our success in making a full-length cDNA clone of dengue virus type 2 (DEN2) from which infectious transcripts could be made. This year we have begun a collaboration to repeat this with another dengue serotype, DEN1. The work accomplished so far is described below. The left-hand 2.6 kb and right-hand 0.5 kb of DEN1 were amplified by RT-PCR using DEN1 virion RNA as template and a thermostable DNA polymerase with a low error rate. The primers used for the PCR incorporated an SP6 promoter just upstream of the DEN1 5\\' end and a unique Sac II site just downstream of the 3\\' end. These two cDNA fragments were cloned into the polylinker of the yeast shuttle vector pRS424, oriented properly. This DNA was linearized with an enzyme that cuts in the polylinker in between the two DEN cDNAs. Meanwhile, an 8 kb cDNA was made from DEN1 RNA by RT-PCR, using a more error-prone polymerase capable of long PCR. This \"stuffer fragment\" represents the middle of the DEN1 genome and overlaps both the left- and right-hand cDNAs contained in the pRS clone. The stuffer fragment and the linearized pRS DNA were used to cotransfect competent trp- yeast to TRP+. This selects for circular forms of the pRS plasmid, which carries theTRP1 gene necessary to confer the TRP+ phenotype. In yeast, double homologous recombination between the stuffer fragment and the left-hand and right-hand cDNAs creates a circular pRS plasmid containing the full-length DEN1 cDNA. TRP+ yeast colonies were screened by PCR to confirm the structure of the pRS plasmids they harbored. Plasmids apparently containing full-length DEN1 cDNA were transfected into E. coli, and large scale DNA preps were done. The structures of four of these E. coli derived plasmids were confirmed as correct by restriction analysis. Transcripts made from these four clones were electroporated into mammalian cells, but were not infectious. Subsequent analysis by transient expression using the vaccinia virus - T7 RNA polymerase system showed that these four clones did not make the expected pattern of DEN1 proteins. Sequencing of selected regions of two of these clones has been done, and shows that there are errors in the stuffer fragment sequences, including a stop codon in one case. Thus, our long PCR product may not be a faithful copy. We will continue to screen for more full-length clones to seek ones that might make infectious transcripts. Meanwhile, we plan to fully sequence one or more of the noninfectious clones, and then try to repair the mistakes, using cDNA made with the low error rate polymerase as the source of the cDNA for repair.

Our studies of activated killer cells are in two areas: (A) Effect of aging on cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) activity, using a murine model in vitro and in vivo, and (B) Activation of natural killer (NK) cells to produce lymphokine activated killer (LAK) activity, using a human model in vitro. Project (A), CTL and aging: (1) Interleukin (IL)-12 augments the generation of alloantigen-specific CTL through a pathway not independent of the stimulation of interferon-gamma. The effect is dependent upon T cells, and independent of NK cells. IL-12 augments the development of CTL by spleen cells from aged mice in vitro to the level of that generated by spleen cells from young mice in the absence of IL-12. (2) The effect of IL-12 vivo was determined in tumor-bearing and normal mice of varying ages. Although IL-12 treatment retarded tumor growth in young and aged mice, it reduced the ability to generated primary and secondary CTL ex vivo. The reason for this was primarily due to the peripheral expansion of immature cells because mature CD4 and CD8 T cells were completely functional. (3) Studies are underway to examine alterations in expression of T cell antigen receptor components with aging, and the potential impact on signaling pathways. Project (B), NK and LAK: (1) Studies on the \"reverse killing\" by NK-sensitive \"target cells\" of IL-2-stimulated but not native NK cells has revealed the involvement of leukocyte integrins. (2) Signaling through Fas can also induce apoptosis of IL-2-activated but not native NK cells. (3) Signaling by IFN-alpha, IL-12 and IL-2 in primary human NK cells involves differential use of JAK kinases and STAT proteins, and the differential use of these signaling molecules may explain the different but yet overlapping effects of these cytokines on NK cells. (4) IL-12 and IL-2 can synergize in the augmentation of NK activity, and the augmentation is associated with increased transcription of genes encoding for perforin and granzymes.

Viral and plasmid vectors are currently being tested for two major uses in human health care: as vaccines and as gene therapy vectors. The induction of immune responses to gene products expressed by a vector determines the success of vaccination. Immune mechanisms responsible for protection by some vaccines are not well understood, and some immune responses can even be harmful, leading to more severe disease upon subsequent exposure. In the case of use of vectors for gene therapy, immune responses can be a limiting factor, especially in the context of readministration. Such immune responses can block efficacy, as seen in clinical trials already, or can cause immunopathology. Immunity to the transgene product of a gene therapy vector could also result in autoimmune-like pathology in some cases. Better understanding of vector-induced immune responses, as studied in this program, can help select predictors of clinical adverse events, and thus can contribute to improved regulatory decision-making. Better definition of the specificity and potency of responses to these products, and identification of the immune mediators that are protective or harmful in specific systems, will help in evaluation of new viral vaccines and gene therapy vectors.

       " 'Antigen specific immunity is mediated by B and T lymphocytes. This characteristic has allowed their use in development of novel therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies and cancer killing LAK and TIL cells. These cells may also play a role in limiting the efficacy of gene therapies since expression of a novel gene product may result in stimulation of immunity and consequent rejction of cells expressing the therapuetic gene product. Also, neoplastic transformation of these cells results in a large proportion of human leukemias and lymphomas. Because of the importance of these cells as therapuetic tools and in disease, we have been studying molecular mechanisms governing lymphoid cell differentiation and neoplasia using several approaches. (1) We use tumors representing different stages of differentiation to further understand the process of lymphoid cell development and to compare and contrast the oncogenic events leading to tumors in different cell lineages. Tumorigenesis can be targeted to the B or T cell lineage by overexpressing the myc oncogene using enhancers specific for immunoglobulin genes or the T cell receptor genes. We have been studying the process of neoplastic transformation in precursor B cells using an RT-PCR assay capable of quantifying expression of 20 candidate oncogenes. We have isolated normal, preneoplastic, and neoplastic preB cells using tissue culture methods and preB cell tumors. We have found that RNA levels of several oncogenes including c-myc, p53, and c-myb increase in level of expression as the cell undergo sequential steps in tumorigenesis and become more fully malignant. (2) Genetic background influences susceptibility to cancer. Recombinant retroviruses carrying two oncogenes cause tumors in Balb c mice but do not give tumors in DBA 2 mice. We investigate the genetic differences in these two strains using in vitro infection of normal preB cell lines from DBA 2 or Balb c mice. In contrast to in vivo results, preB cell lymphomas can be established from mice of both strains. These tumors are preB cells but lose IL-7 and stromal cell dependence. They yeild solid tumors with a 10 to 20 day latency when injected into both strains. These results demonstrate that preB cells from both tumor resistant and tumor susceptible strains can indeed be infected by virus and suggests that the genetic differences between strains may be external to infected preB cells so may include immune surveillance differences. (3) We have used Ebeta-myc mice (myc gene expression conttrolled by the TCRbeta enhancer) to determine the influence of the myc gene on T cell development in the thymus by examining effects on positive selection, negative selection, and co-receptor determination. Myc gene overexpression seems to leave negative selection intact, to disrupt positive selection, and to favor differentiation into the CD4 lineage. ',\n",
       " 'Flow cytometry is an emerging technology that has become the method of choice of measuring the binding of monoclonal antibodies to cells. Early studies have established several candidate methods that might be used to regulate the actual flow cytometry devices. These methods not only can compare qualitative analyses of antibody binding, but can also provide quantitative measurements to directly compare devices from manufacturers. Other aspects of this collaborative project involve quality assurance measurements of these candidate methods among the individual laboratories of the Flow Cytometry Consortium, as well as selected outside laboratories involved in flow cytometry research. Early results suggest that of the devices may not be major factors for the source of variation. Rather it is theneed for a standard calibration curve, unified setup, compensation controls, whole blood controls and control of fixation. Flow cytometry technology is rapidly expanding as a clinical tool that is used to classify AIDS patient categories, to define the disease of AIDS, to follow surrogate endpoints in many diseases, to prepare bone marrow stem cells and to define clinical correlates of disease. Because of its widespread use in clinical diagnosis and treatment, it is imperative to insure that the technology is reproducible and that the measurements and performance of such machines can be calibrated to standards. Because this technology crosscuts products regulated by CBER, CDER and CDRH, an interagency Flow Cytometry Consortium has been formed to pool resources and to develop methods for quantitative flow cytometry standards, and methods of quality assurance. The Consortium members include four FDA centers, the NIH and the CDC. Calibration curves for CD4 and CD34 are being prepared. ',\n",
       " \"1) Interleukin-4(IL-4) and its soluble receptor are being tested in the clinic for rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and cancer by systematic injection or by gene transfer using viral vectors. Studies are underway to characterize structure, function, signal transduction and targeting of IL- 4 expressed on immune and cancer cells. The structure and function of receptor for IL-13, another IL-4 related interleukin, is also being investigated. Reconstitution studies have demonstrated that IL-13R' chain is a novel component of IL-4R in non-hematopoietic cells and the common IL-2R chain is a component of IL-4R systems in hematopoietic cells. It is also demonstrated that IL-4R chain is a necessary component of IL-13r system. Thus, IL-4R and IL-13R share more than one chain with each other. These studies help explain the mechanism of efficacy and toxicity seen when unusually low concentrations of IL-4 are used in cancer patients. 2) To understand the molecular mechanism of signal transduction by the IL-4 AND IL-13 receptor, we have studied the phosphorylation and activation of JAK kinases and signal transduction activator of transcription (STAT) intracellular proteins. Our studies demonstrate that both IL-4 and IL-13 utilize similar tyrosine kinases and same STAT6 for signalling in cancer cells and this pattern is different from immune cells. IL-4 can utilize either IL-13R' or IL-2R chain with IL-4R chain for its signal transduction. IL-13 also utilizes IL-4R and IL-13R' chain for signal transduction. These studies explain why IL-4 and IL-13 have redundant effect on a variety of cell types. Additional reconstitution experiments are underway to examine which kinases associate with various chains of IL- 4 and IL-13R complexes. 3) The IL-4 and IL-13R directed targeting of a Pseudomonas exotoxin, Diphtheria toxin, or alternatively receptor directed gene transfer is also being investigated. The receptors for these two interleukins are expressed in abundance on human tumor cells that offer an attractive target for toxin therapy for gene therapy. In vivo experiments in nude mice using human brain tumor has demonstrated complete responses in 100% of the animals in response to circular permuted IL-4 toxin. Pre- clinical experiments including pharmokinetics and toxicology in mice, intracerebral administration in rats and intrathecal and i.v. administration in monkeys have been performed. Based on these results, our phase 1 clinical trial was approved by CBER. We have treated one patient at John Wayne Cancer Institute, Santa Monica, CA at the lowest dose with no evidence of toxicity. Additional patients are being enrolled. These clinical studies will help elucidate safety profile of this and other chimeric toxins in clinic under various INDs. \",\n",
       " 'Proteins can become oxidized under a variety of conditions in vitro and in vivo. Specific polypeptide changes include formation of aldehyde (carbonyl) groups, generation of methionine sulfoxide and dityrosine, rearrangement of disulfide bonds, cleavage of peptide bonds, and protein aggregation. The consequences of protein oxidative modifications are varied. Some modifications lead to differential susceptibility of a protein to proteolytic cleavage while others cause gain or loss of biological activity. For example, we have found that oxidative modification of fibrinogen inhibits ability of the protein to undergo clotting. Conversely, oxidation of plasma protease inhibitors can lead to an increase of clotting activity. Our research involves examination of the conditions under which proteins acquire oxidative modifications and development of assays that provide a correct assessment of the types of modifications incurred. We determined that the carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins do not undergo oxidative modification to carbonyl groups under conditions that oxidize amino acid side chains. In addition, we validated the use of a Western blot assay for protein carbonyls for use on glycoproteins. Current studies are aimed at developing an appropriate in vitro model for studying protein oxidative modification in cells exposed to varying growth conditions, including oxidative stress. Because cellular lipids are also targets for oxidative attack and can modify proteins through conjugation reactions, it is important to distinguish between lipid-derived protein modifications and direct protein oxidative modification. We have chosen to work with lymphoma cells that express different levels of the oncogene bcl-2 because resistance to oxidative processes is thought to correlate with expression of high levels of the Bcl-2 protein. The biological consequences of oxidative reactions will be explored by comparing the effects of H2O2 treatment on cells that are either sensitive or resistant to this oxidant. ',\n",
       " 'Autoimmune diseases result from the inappropriate recognition of self antigens by T cells. While recent treatment strategies have focused on modulating signals through the antigen specific T cell receptor (TCR), the complex nature of the TCR has impeded the development of such approaches. A better understanding of the TCR components and the development of animal models in which the TCR components can be qualitatively and quantitatively manipulated will aid in the development and testing of new treatments for autoimmune disease. The TCR is composed of at least 6 different chains involved in antigen recognition or signal transduction. The zeta chain of the TCR is a particularly potent signaling molecule due to the 3 repeated activation motifs (ITAMS) in its intracytoplasmic tail. To study the role of zeta-chain in T cell responses, we have created mice in which the gene encoding zeta-chain has been inactivated by homologous recombination (zeta- -). We have also generated mice expressing transgenes encoding normal or truncated forms of zeta (missing all three or particular ITAMs). Alternatively, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the gamma chain of the FcR, that is homologous to zeta and which has been found associated with the TCR in certain T cell populations. The ability to breed these zeta related transgenes into the zeta- - background makes it possible to specifically examine the role of zeta in T cell response in vivo. Moreover, since zeta controls the amount of TCR complexes on the cell surface, this system also allows us to address the relation between TCR levels (extent of signalling) and specific T cell responses. Using a combination of approaches we are examining the role of zeta-chain and zeta-related molecules in T cell tolerance, activation and development. Future experiments will involve breeding these zeta-related molecules into mice bearing transgenes encoding TCRs with autoreactive specificities. Such studies should result in a better understanding of T cell tolerance and provide important animal models for testing new TCR-directed therapies for autoimmune disease. 1. Shores, E.W. and P.E.

       " 'We are studying the immunoglobulin isotype switch induced by interleukin-4 (IL-4) in human and murine B lymphocytes. In the human system we are focussing on the switch to IgE (epsilon heavy chain), the isotype of allergy. Our earlier evidence for a sequential mu-gamma-epsilon switch in a cloned cell line prompted us to explore this phenomenon in normal lymphocytes switching in culture under the influence of IL-4. From such cells we have cloned nine composite switch regions reflecting mu-gamma- epsilon sequential switch and have determined that all of these involve the switch region of gamma. This determination required the complete sequences of the switch regions from all four of the human gamma genes, which we have not obtained. These studies of composite switch regions on the chromosomal DNA are being complemented by analysis of the reciprocal products amplified from circular DNA. In the murine system we are collaborating on several studies of IL-4 induced switching to IgG1. We have employed our Digestion-Circularization-Polymerase-Chain- Reaction(DCPCR) assay to show that the percent of cytokine-induced cultured splenocytes expressing surface IgG1 can be accounted for by the amount of DNA switch recombination detectable in the cultured cells, so non-recombinational switching mechanisms (e.g. trans-splicing) need not be postulated. DCPCR was also used to show that when splenocytes are cultured with IL-4 along with anti-delta-dextran (as a stimulus for proliferation), addition of IL-5 is required for significant DNA switch recombination. To explore the mechanism of the switch event we have initiated studies on the role of the B cell-specific protein BSAP, encoded by the Pax-5 gene, which binds to several cultured murine splenocytes with a BSAP antisense oligonucleotide that reduces the detectable BSAP protein causes a decrease in cell proliferation and in IgG1 surface expression, suggesting an important role of BSAP in these cells. With our UCLA collaborators we have been studying human immunoglobulin epsilon mRNA isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. We now have evidence for nine different isoforms, encoding six distinct predicted epsilon proteins. We are exploring which of these proteins exist in significant amounts and how they may differ in parameters of binding to the Fc-epsilon receptor. ',\n",
       " 'Characterizing the molecular pathways used by HIV-1 during virus infection is important to understanding both the pathogenesis of HIV and to evaluating and developing new therapies and vaccines for AIDS. We have been studying the early molecular events involved in HIV-1 cell attachment and infection of human cells. We are investigating: 1) the role of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans in T cell tropic HIV binding and cell penetration, and 2) the molecular events mediating primary monocytotropic virus entry.1. Role of cell surface proteoglycans in HIV infection. Following initial HIV binding to the CD4 receptor, the virus envelope is thought to bind to other cell surface molecules during the attachment and fusion process. We have observed that heparan sulfate proteoglycan(HS) mediates some the second steps in virus entry by interacting with an oligomeric form of envelope gp120 through a specific subregion of the the V3 region or \"principal neutralizing domain\". This interaction controls the kinetics of virus entry and is critical for rapid virus entry and infection. Regulation of HS synthesis is important for determining the extent of virus entry through this pathway. Our results also indicate that other molecules interact with the V3 region in close approximation to the HS binding site. 2. Identification of co-receptors for HIV. We are characterizing cell surface molecules which are required for infection of primary and T-cell tropic HIV isolates. We have generated monoclonal antibodies to cells competent to growth primary viruses and are screening these antibodies for HIV blocking activity. MAbs which specifically react with HIV binding structures will be biochemically and functionally characterized. Genetic approaches are being developed to clone genes encoding molecules which mediate primary HIV infection. Identifying the molecular targets of HIV infection is important to understanding and developing new therapeutics and vaccines for AIDS. ',\n",
       " 'Chemokines are important for normal immune function and have potent anti-HIV effects. We have been studying cell surface molecules which regulate chemokine structure, secretion and function. Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been identified as initial cell binding sites for chemokines with anti-HIV activity and are necessary for efficient blocking by the CC-chemokine RANTES. Cells expressing low levels of proteoglycans show reduced sensitivity to chemokine antiviral effects. Cell surface proteases have been characterized that regulate the activity of chemokines. Protease cleavage of susceptible chemokines results in changes in the structure and receptor specificity of the proteins. The results of these studies indicate that activity of chemokines depends on multiple factors including; the concentration and structure of the chemoattractants, the level of proteoglycan expression, and the number of specific chemokine receptors on target cells.

       " \"Murine myeloid leukemia M1 cells undergo terminal differentiation to mature macrophages after stimulation with IL-6. This cell line serves as a unique model for studying the molecular and cellular events occurring during the process of myeloid differentiation. One marker of myeloid differentiation is the expression of the inducible enzyme nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). This enzyme catalyzes the production of nitric oxide (NO) which is involved in anti-bacterial and anti-tumor actions of macrophages. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of transactivation of the iNOS gene expression. Our studies showed that iNOS expression is transcriptionally regulated by IL-6 in M1 cells and therefore, we focused on the role of transcription factors in the induction of iNOS gene expression by IL-6 during differentiation. Our studies targeted the proximal 5' region of the iNOS promoter since this region has been shown to contain several important transcriptional regulation sequences and was shown to directly mediate iNOS gene activation. We have identified several DNA-binding complexes which are induced by IL-6 and bind to several regions of the iNOS promoter. The induction of these DNA-binding complexes correlated with the kinetics of expression of iNOS mRNA induced by IL-6. In addition, we identified an octamer consensus sequence in the iNOS promoter. Methylation interference studies demonstrate two specific guanine residues within the octamer region which are essential for IL-6-induced octamer binding protein interaction with DNA. \",\n",
       " 'Activation of macrophages by LPS results in production of various mediators, such as IL-1, IL-6, TNFa and GM-CSF, which are involved in regulating hematopoiesis, inflamation and immune responses. Recently it has been shown that agents that interact with microtubules, such as taxol and colchicine, can induce production of some of these mediators. In an effort to clarify the role of microtubules in the regulation of GM-CSF, we examined whether depolymerization of microtubules will affect GM-CSF production in macrophages. The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was treated with colchicine (1 micromole) and LPS (50 ng ml) and GM-CSF mRNA and protein expression examined. Colchicine did not induce GM-CSF expression in RAW 264.7 cells. However, pretreatment of the cells with colchicine resulted in a time-dependent down-regulation of LPS-induced GM-CSF steady-state mRNA expression and protein production. Maximun inhibition of LPS-induced GM-CSF expression was observed when cells were pre-treated for 4 hours with colchicine. Actinomycin D chase experiments revealed colchicine pre-treatment did not alter GM-CSF mRNA half-life.Studies using stable transfectants containing the GM-CSF promoter and the lucifersae reporter gene coding region showed that colchicine pre-treatment inhibited LPS-induced transcription of luciferase. In addition, to GM-CSF, colchicine also inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA expression but not iNOS expression. Using b-tubulin mRNA expression as an indirect measure of tubulin depolymerization, colchicine treatment of RAW264.7 cells decreased b-tubulin mRNA expression in a time dependent manner and correlated, temporally, with the decrease in GM-CSF mRNA expression. Thus, LPS and colchicine regulate GM-CSF expression at the level of transcription and the de-polymerization of microtubules can differentially affect LPS induced gene expression. ',\n",
       " 'The overall objectives of this project is to establish a hemopoietic stem cell model which can be tested to study and understand the mechanism of self renewal and or commitment to differentiated cell types by a primitive cell. A high incidence of lineage, undifferentiated cells was identified in the spleens of female NZB mice. Phenotypic, morphological, histochemical, genomic and functional characterization of the purified population suggested that these may be very primitive cells of the hemopoietic system. In Vitro, these cells were found to differentiate in response to a few early-acting lymphokines and a bone marrow stromal cell conditioned medium. In that culture system, both myeloid (adherent Mac- 1+), and lymphoid (CD3+, surface Ig+) cell types were detectable. In vivo, these cells reconstitute immunodeficient SCID mice into fully functional immunocompetent mice. Similar splenic stem cells from BALB c mice also. In the present reporting period (October 1992 thru september 1993), the comparative reconstituting potentials of bone marrow vs spleen derived stem cells was examined in neonatal NFS X NZBF1 mice model. Neonates were bred in house and were injected with in 24 hrs of their birth with graded dose of splenic stem cells and bone marrow cells. The recipient F1 mice were being typed for all the lineages of the donor origin by two-color FMF analyses. A dose dependant reconstitution of stem cells of donor origin was observed. Both marrow-derived and splenic stem cells exhibited similar reconstituting abilities. Further, marrow derived and splenic stem cells from SCID mice reconstituted primarily (either with the marrow-derived or splenic stem cells) successfully reconstituted the secondary SCID mice, confirming the self renewal potential of splenic stem cells. The SCID-NZB mice reconstituted with marrow derived and splenic stem cells were examined for the development of antierythrocytic antibodies and proteinurea, the indicators of Lupus disease. At the that time results were negative, suggesting the splenic or marrow derived stem cells in a non-autoimmune microenvironment develop into functional normal immune cells. ',\n",
       " 'The objectives of these studies is to analyze the regulatory mechanisms implicated in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and, specifically, the determinant peptide sequence of the FcgammaRI involved in the regulation of the receptor in monocytes and cells of the monocytic lineage. To study the nature of putative cytolytic molecules involved in ADCC by monocytic effectors, cells were induced to differentiate with either gamma-IFN or PMA, and new protein synthesis was inhibited at various time points with cycloheximide. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide during the early stages of differentiation, resulted in diminution of ADCC against antibody-coated SRBC. Partially or completely differentiated cells were resistant to the effect of protein synthesis inhibition. Unstimulated U937 cells demonstrated FcgammaRI, II and III surface receptors, but were unable to mediate cytotoxicity. Stimulation with gamma-IFN increased FcRI expression and allowed the cells to mediate ADCC. Surface FcgammaRI expression was not increased when cells were induced with PMA. Nevertheless, U937 cells were able to exert cytotoxicity against antibody-coated SRBC. These results provide evidence that in the monocyte linage, two dissociable components are implicated in the antibody-mediated cytotoxic mechanism against SRBC: the high affinity receptor for immunoglobulines (FcgammaRI), and an inducible protein-based lytic mechanism. These two elements developed independently during \"in vitro\" differentiation, as suggested by the difference in their respective induction time. The inability of cycloheximide to block ADCC in more differentiated cells, suggests that preformed lytic molecules mediate cytotoxicity and that FcgammaR mediated signals activate them without the need for new protein synthesis. We have also developed a retroviral construct encoding for the FcgammaRI. We are testing several cell lines(FcgammaRI negative ADCC positive) to be use as targets for transfection. These will permit further study of FcRI-mediated ADCC, by deletion and or point mutation of specific amino acid sequences to determine the sites involved in intracellular signaling. ',\n",
       " 'The immune response to polysaccharide (PS) antigens is highly regulated and has several distinguishing features including restricted subclass, variable region gene usage, fine specificity, and avidity. Simple PS not conjugated to protein (such as bacterial levan (BL) or Neisseria meningitidis group C (MCPS)) elicit a thymus-independent (TI) response. PS conjugated to proteins (such as MCPS coupled to tetanus toxoid, (MCPS-TT)), on the other hand, elicit a different type of response, termed thymus-dependent (TD). Recent studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies (mAb) derived from mice immunized twice with a TI polysaccharide antigen, BL, can exhibit somatic mutations and affinity maturation, features previously thought to be properties only of responses to TD antigens. Among BL mAb, a single mutation encoding amino acid 53 in CDR2 correlated with increased antibody avidity. Ongoing studies involve site-directed mutagenesis and chain recombination to prove that this single site can alter the antibody avidity and to determine if it contributes to binding specificity. Dot blot and Northern analyses of anti-MCPS mAb reveal that VH gene family usage is dominated by VHJ558 (the largest VH gene family). These antibodies were not derived from a selected germ-line gene. The VHJ558 gene for 1705.18 resembles more closely the VHJ558 belonging to the anti-Dextran 19.1.2 group. 3006.18 and C2 974.1 resemble those anti-Dextran of group 9.14.7. The other mAb may represent a possible third group. Four of the mAb sequenced to date belong to the Vk4 5 family denoted VkOX1. This gene family is utilized in response to the hapten 2-phenyloxazolone. The sequences for the 1705.18, 1863.5 and 2055.5 mAbs are closely related. The 1922.2 mAb represents a different germ-line gene of the same family. Fine specificity and VH family usage do not seem to correlate with the exception of VH3609 mAbs which are specific for MCPS and are only found in response to the TI form. These antibodies are encoded by the VH3609.3 germline gene with very few changes. One Vk23 gene has been found to combine with VH3609 to bind MCPS. DNA sequence data indicated that several genes produced in response to MCPS are utilized also by auto-antibodies. Sequence analysis in progress will determine if somatic mutation can account for the increased diversity and increased avidity of the immune response to MCPS-TT over MCPS alone. ',\n",
       " \"Antibody producing cells are the terminally differentiated cells of the B lymphocyte lineage. Throughout the differentiation process, B lineage cells display cell surface molecules which, in addition to providing specific functions, serve as landmarks for the developmental stage of a B cell or can divide B cells into functional subsets. One cell surface marker which divides mature B cells into subsets is the Lyb5 antigen. The subset of B cells expressing Lyb5 matures later than Lyb5 cells and responds to thymus independent type 2 antigens which are largely bacterial polysaccharides. The antiserum which originally defined the Lyb5 antigen was a polyclonal antiserum which, unfortunately no longer exists. Because of this lab's interest in the immune response to bacterial polysaccharides, we are particularly interested in studying the development of the Lyb5 B cell subset. To do this, we attempted to recreate the anti-Lyb5 antiserum by generating hybridomas made with spleen cells from C57BL 6 mice which had been hyperimmunized with DBA 2 spleen cells. (C57BL 6 mice have a different Lyb5 allele than DBA 2 mice.) This follows the original protocol used to generate the anti-Lyb5 specificity. Once hybridomas were established, they were screened for binding to splenic B cells from a variety of mouse strains by flow cytometry. While the anti-Lyb5 specificity has not yet been duplicated, we have identified 5 anti-B cell monoclonal antibodies of potential interest. These antibodies are being further characterized to rule out other known specificities and those with unique specificity will be studied in depth to determine the role that the cell surface molecule plays in B cell development and function. \",\n",
       " 'There is a great deal of information regarding the minimal requirements for activation of primed T cells. T cell clones can be stimulated to release granule contents and produce lymphokines by anti-CD3 antibody or purified antigen-MHC proteins. T cell hybridomas can also be stimulated to produce lymphokines by anti-CD3 antibody or purified antigen-MHC proteins. Activation of these primed T cell lines can occur in the absence of specialized presenting cells and their accessory molecules. This project is to define the minimal requirements for activation of naive T cells and to evaluate the effects of additional stimuli on the magnitude and type of T cell activation elicited. We have been successful in the activation of T cells using different activators such as: anti-CD3 antibody and purified allo-MHC molecules. The relevant cell populations in the activation are being evaluated by fluorescent activated cell sorting. We are presently studying different T cell activation parameters (lymphokine production, anergy, induction, signal transduction, and gene expression) in this sytem. We will then evaluate changes in these T cell responses caused by the deletion or addition of antigen presenting cells, lymphokines, adhesion molecules or costimulatory molecules to T cell stimulus. We have generated a recombinant soluble immune ICAM-1 for use in our experiments and will pursue the generation of other soluble adhesion costimulatory molecules. The molecular requirements for T cell activation and the varying phenotypes of this activation are very basic to the generation of successful immunity and the modulation of aberrant immune responses.

       " \"Perturbation of the T cell receptor (TCR) by antigen MHC or by anti-receptor antibodies (Ab) initiates a cascade of events which include protein tyrosine kinase activation and the phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cg-1 (PLCg1). PLCg-1 contains a number of src-homology (SH) domains. These domains function as protein docking sites and are likely to play a role in coupling PLCg-1 to the TCR CD3 complex and in regulating its activity. Our goal is to establish a structure-function relationship for PLCg1 activation in T lymphocytes. Specific aims of this project are: 1). The identification of T-cell proteins that interact with PLCg1 SH domains. 2). The identification of the functional role of PLCg1 SH domains in T-lymphocyte activation. The project's strategy is as follows: 1). Expression of PLCg1 domains as GST- fusion proteins, as a screening tool for the identification of candidate binding proteins. 2). Demonstration of the interaction between native proteins. 3). Characterization of the function of individual domains by mutational anlaysis of an epitope-tagged PLCg1. PLCg1 GST-SH2(N) domain bound a phosphoprotein of about 38 kDa, while the SH2(C) domain bound phosphoproteins of about 38, 75, and 120 kDa and, to a lesser extent, 60, 85 and 100 kDa phosphoproteins. The GST-SH3 domain bound a prominent tyrosine phosphorylated protein of 120 kDa. Phospho- proteins of about 38 and about 120 kDa were coprecipitated with native PLCg1 from CD3-activated cells and a phosphoprotein of about 75 kDa was observed in cells treated with pervanadate, a strong inducer of protein tyrosine phosphorylation used for mimicry of T-cell activation. The 120 kDa SH3 domain-binding phospho- protein was identified as cbl, a protein of unknown function, but rapidly phosphorylated in response to mitogens or Ab-mediated ligation of the receptor. A constitutive interaction between native PLCg1 and cbl was shown by co-precipitation in Jurkat cells and displacement by a peptide encoding an SH3-binding motif of cbl. The function of cbl in T cell activation is addressed as a separate project (Z01 BO 04002-02 LIB). Single amino acid mutations of PLCg1 SH domains were performed on the basis of loss-of-function mutations of conserved amino acids in the SH domains of Grb2. A prominent defect in CD3-induced PLCg1 tyrosine phosphorylation was associated with the mutation of the SH2(N), but not the SH2(C) or SH3 domains. The SH2(N) domain binds exclusively to a about 38 kDa phospho- protein, suggesting that this protein, likely to be the recently cloned protein, Lnk, may be critical for phosphorylation of PLCg1 in response to CD3 ligation. Mutation of PLCg1 SH2(N) domain did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation in response to treatment with pervanadate, suggesting that the mutated PLCg1 could be phosphorylated by alternate mechanism(s). \",\n",
       " 'Induction of HIV from a latent state was studied using the U1 cell line. Specifically, the effect of various chemical carcinigens and environmental mutagens was examined for their ability to induce virus from this cell line with the objective of identifying risk factors of physiologic relevance that may affect disease progression in AIDS. U1 cells were treated with 2 different concentrations of various carcinogens. Virus production was measured by p24 antigen, RT, DNA and RNA analysis. Enhances virus production was seen in cells treated with benzopyrene, NNK and aflatoxin B. Viral induction was accompanied by an increase in NF- KB activity and production of cytokines such as TNF- alpha. In the case of aflatoxin, virus induction appeared to be a TNF- alpha independent mechanism. The role of other cytokines, second messengers and cellular signaling pathways in the induction of HIV by these agents is currently under investigation. These experiments are also being performed in chronically infected cells that produce low levels of virus. ',\n",
       " '1) Primer pairs that permit detection and discrimination of HIV-1 and HIV-2 by PCR have been designed for use with clinical samples. We have also optimized a multiplex PCR assay for the detection of HIV-1, -2, HTLV-I, -II. The performance of the assay has been evaluated on clinical samples from patients with co-infections. 2) A sensitive RNA-PCR assay was developed for the detection of viral RNA in body fluids. and applied to the detection and quantitation of virus in body fluids and infected cells from patients. This method was used to assess the presence of HIV in saliva of infected individuals and in commercial products. 3) A novel, viral capture assay based on magnetic beads coated with HIV env antibodies has been developed for detection of viral RNA in body fluids. The assay has demonstrated high sensitivity in HIV positive individuals. A non isotopic format has also been optimized. Future applications include studies on the infectious \"window\" period, a primary concern to blood safety and virus load assessment in HIV disease and antiviral therapy involving patients. One of these studies involves an evaluation of primary infection and progressive vs. non progressive infection where virus will be quantitated by PCR and characterized by nucleotide sequencing of virus isolates and phenotypic culture assays. A multiplex format of the assay will also be optimized for HIV and HCV RNA for detection in the window phase. Since multiplex formats may be the cost-effective approach to implementation of these techniques for blood screening, these studies will allow us to be familiar with issues in optimization and standardization of such assays. 4) Efforts are in progress to generate standards for quantitation of HIV RNA in plasma. QC-PCR and Q-PCR are being evaluated using virus stocks containing known amounts of HIV p24 antigen spiked into HIV negative plasma. These reagents will be assessed in collaboration with the International Working Group on Gene Amplification techniques and used to quantitate HIV RNA in plasma (Ag+ve Ab+ve or -ve) from HIV positive individuals.

       " 'Cytokines play an important role in HIV pathogenesis. We have previously shown that treatment of monocytes with interferon-g (IFN-g), a cytokines produced by activated T lymphocytes, prior to exposure with HIV results in complete inhibition of HIV infection of monocytes. We have extended this study to obtain information on the mechanism(s) underlying IFN-g-induced inhibition of HIV infection of monocytes. We examined the effect of IFN-g on HIV entry into monocytes, the first event in the infectious cycle of the virus. Virus entry into monocytes was examined by PCR amplification of HIV-gag sequences in the genomic DNA and RNA of monocytes exposed to HIV after IFN-g treatment. The results from these experiments showed no evidence of either proviral DNA or HIV RNA sequences, and were consistent with the absence of intracellular virus particles either in latent or actively replicating state as determined by flow cytometric analysis of HIV-exposed monocytes. In addition, no HIV-induced cytopathic effects, such as multinucleated giant cell formation or cell death were observed in IFN-g-treated monocytes. Stimulation of IFN-g-treated monocytes 6 days post-infection with tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), which is known to augment HIV replication in HIV-infected cells, did not result in the induction of HIV indicating the absence of latent HIV infection in IFN-g-treated monocytes. Treatment of monocytes with IFN-g, TNF-a, or with a combination of the two agents which is known to induce antimicrobial free radical nitric oxide (NO2-) in the murine system, did not induce NO2- production in human monocytes suggesting the antiviral activity of IFN-g to be independent of NO2--mediated killing of HIV or HIV-infected monocytes. IFN-g substantially down-regulated surface CD4 expression on monocytes and was directly related to intracellular HIV-p24 levels. These results indicate that IFN-g-mediated inhibition of HIV infection of monocytes was not due to virus latency or killing of these cells, but was primarily due to down-regulation of CD4 expression resulting in the inhibition of HIV entry into monocytes, and thus provide a mechanism of IFN-g-mediated inhibition of HIV infection of monocytes. Antiviral activity of IFN-g was also associated with the reduction of soluble factors that are involved in HIV pathogenesis and the inhibition of monocyte invasion through basement membrane matrices. Two manuscripts describing these studies are \"in press\". Further studies on the production of cytokines and other cellular factors are in progress to understand viral gene expression that may more clearly define the interplay of these events in the regulation of virus-cell interactions.

       " 'In our studies of the biology of HIV macrophage infections we ask the following two questions: What cellular genes are regulated by HIV infection of macrophages What viral determinants contribute to macrophage tropism The first question we have addressed by using PCR-based subtractive hybridization methods to make libraries of genes up or down regulated by HIV infection of normal human macrophages in tissue culture. We have isolated several novel, previously unreported genes specifically upregulated by HIV infection of macrophages when compared to LPS treated controls. We are now analyzing the regulation of these genes by HIV infection of T cells and are following their expression in AIDS patients. The second question we are addressing by using a new saturation mutagenesis method called \"genomic footprinting\". In this technique, retroviral integrase is used to scatter defined primer insertions randomly throughout the HIV genome, theoretically hitting every position. Paired with primers homologous to known locations in the HIV genome, the primers can be detected by PCR. When a library of mutants is subjected to PCR and the products displayed on a sequencing gel, a ladder is seen, each position representing one primer insertion. When the library is passed through a biological or selective system and redisplayed, defective mutants drop out and are detected as bands missing from the ladder. We plan to make a library of HIV mutants in the dual tropic strain, DH12. We will passage this library through T cells and macrophages in parallel, running the displays side by side to detect differences. ',\n",
       " 'Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and a continuing regulatory challenge for ensuring the safety of the blood supply. The Miyazaki Cohort Study is an ongoing study of 973 people in an area of Japan where both HCV and the human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) are highly prevalent. Between 1985-1995, there were 14 seroconverters to antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) in this population (3.6 seroconverters per 1,000 person-years in previously seronegative persons). HCV-RNA was detectable in 10 of the seroconverters, and it remained detectable for greater than one year in eight of them. Both HCV and the hepatitis B virus may lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in some patients, often in association with mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Detection of mutations by direct sequencing provides more information than immunohistochemical (IH) staining, but the equipment needed and the time required make it less practical for use in large-scale studies or in studies in developing countries. In a study of 28 HCCs, 19 (68%) had 50 to 95% of cells stained. Mutations in p53 exons 5-8 were found by direct sequencing in 17 (61%), indicating a high level of sensitivity and specificity of IH compared to direct sequencing to detect mutant p53 in HBV-infected patients with HCC. ',\n",
       " 'Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important blood-borne infection; it is mainly through continued screening of blood donations and inactivation procedures for plasma derivatives that it is excluded as a transfusion complication. The close association between HBV and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) makes these measures even more significant. Recently, genetic variants of HBV have been discovered; the mutations found in these may explain more severe clinical findings in some patients. The HBV X protein has been shown to transactivate a variety of cellular and viral genes and it may play a part in the pathogenesis of HBV-associated HCC. We extracted DNA from HCC tissues and adjacent nontumorous livers from 20 patients and from the sera of 18 residents of the same county in China who were chronically infected with HBV without HCC. A 228-base pair segment of the X gene was amplified by nested PCR and sequenced. Point mutations were found at X gene codons 130 and 131 in 17 20 HCC tissues (85%) compared to 2 18 sera of persons chronically infected with HBV without HCC (11%) (p<0.0001). Both mutations are located in the enhancer-II-core promoter region of the HBV genome; both are upstream and adjacent to codons 132 to 139, a region essential for transactivation by X. It is possible that mutations at codons 130 and 131 may affect HBV replication or X gene transactivation. ',\n",
       " 'The objective of this project is determination of the clinical significance of data derived from a previously developed device (Fratantoni, et al, Quantitative assessment of platelet morphology by light scattering: A potential method for evaluation of platelets for transfusion. J Lab Clin Med 103:620, 1984). The device measures the degree of disc-like morphology of platelets, a parameter believed to correlate with normal platelet function. The measurement is made without violating the integrity of the platelet container. The device will be used to obtain measurements on platelet units intended for transfusion into patients. A sample of the platelet suspension will also be tested in an in vitro device that emulates a bleeding time measurement. This is accomplished by forcing the platelet suspension through an orifice in a membrane that has been coated with collagen and noting the time required for a platelet plug to form. Clinical measurements of hemostasis will also be obtained from the patients for 48 hours following transfusion. The data will be analyzed to determine whether the light scattering device provides any predictive information on the behavior of the platelets. If this is the case, the device may have value in routine blood bank use. ',\n",
       " 'Several studies have shown that recombinant FVIII products often have discrepant potencies when different assay methods are applied. In the case of one recombinant product, use of the chromogenic assay, mandated in Europe, would mean that 30% less FVIII would be delivered to patients on a molar basis than if one applied the standard one-stage clotting assay used in the United States. In contrast, a B-domain deleted recombinant FVIII gave about 1.25 fold higher potency in the one-stage clotting assay than in the chromogenic assay. It is important for us to discern the mechanism responsible for such discrepancies, to achieve standardization of potency measurements for recombinant FVIII. Results: The activity of FVIII from six different recombinant and plasma-derived FVIII preparations were examined with either one-stage clotting or chromogenic assays. We found that one recombinant FVIII product had discrepancy in its activity when assayed by the two different assay methods. The chromogenic assay gave significantly higher activity than the one-stage clotting assay (Chromogenic one-stage=1.445, n=7, 0.001>p>0.0001). By immunoprecipitation and Western-blotting analysis, we found that this FVVIII had more polypeptide species that contained the B-domain of FVIII compared to plasma-derived FVIII. In addition, we found a >200 kDa band not observed in plasma-derived FVIII. Antibody mapping suggests that the >200 kDa polypeptide is an N-terminal truncated single polypeptide FVIII. Thrombin catalyzes the activation of FVIII by cleaving several peptide bonds located on the heavy and light chains of the FVIII molecule. To evaluate the effect of the B-domain and other acidic regions of FVIII on thrombin-catalyzed activation, we first asked whether there is a complementary binding site(s) on thrombin in addition to the catalytic site for FVIII. a-Thrombin, blocked at its active site by D-Phe-Pro-Arg Chloromethyl Ketone (PPACK), inhibited thrombin activation of FVIII. This suggests that a site(s) on thrombin, other than the active site, is needed for FVIII activation. Thrombin-catalyzed cleavages of both the heavy and light chains of FVIII were inhibited by a sulfated polypeptide segment of the FVIII heavy chain, residues 714-740 (F8II). F8II did not inhibit either the amidolytic or the clotting activity of thrombin. This further supports the involvement of sites on thrombin, other than the active site, in FVIII activation. To investigate the potential importance of the fibrinogen-recognition exosite of thrombin on FVIII cleavage, the C- terminal dodecapeptide of hirudin named Hirugen, which binds to the exosite, was tested as an inhibitor of thrombin proteolysis of FVIII. The peptide only partially inhibited the digestion of FVIII, mainly on the light chain, by a-thrombin. Furthermore, g-thrombin, which lacks the fibrinogen-recognition exosite, cleaved both the heavy and light chains of FVIII, at positions similar to those cleaved by a-thrombin. We conclude that a novel recognition site on thrombin, in addition of the fibrinogen- recognition exosite and the active site of thrombin, is involved in activation of FVIII. An acidic region (residues 714-740) of FVIII binds to one of the sites on thrombin involved in the rate-limiting step of the reaction. Future studies: 1) Identify the novel secondary binding site on thrombin for FVIII activation. 2) Characterize the effect of such binding on FVIII activity and the impact of the binding on the discrepancies between the one-stage clotting and chromogenic assays. 3) Identify and characterize the FVIII-binding site(s)on FXa. We will also evaluate the effect of the N-terminal truncated greater than kDA FVIII or other proteins, such as von Willebrand Factor, on the FVIII activity assays. ',\n",
       " \"At pH 8.6 and low ionic strength, unblocked (i.e. containing 1 free SH) bovine albumin (BA) shows 3 denaturation peaks by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); these correspond to the unfolding of discrete regions within BA. In contrast, blocked BA, prepared by reaction of the free SH with L-cystine, exhibits only 2 peaks, which have denaturation temperatures (Td's) corresponding to those of the second and third transitions seen with unblocked BA. We have demonstrated that this observation is a manifestation of the linkage between protein denaturation and disulfide linked dimer formation, which involves S-S bond formation between free SH groups of fully and or partially unfolded (but not native) monomers. In blocked BA, 2 regions have the same Td with the third region having a higher Td (i.e. Td(1) = Td(2) < Td(3)). In unblocked BA, Td(1) is shifted downward from Td(2) due to the stabilization of the partially and fully unfolded species through coupling between the unfolding and dimerization equilibria whereas the other Td's are essentially unperturbed. We have begun a study of human albumin (HA) at pH 7.0. At low ionic strength, both unblocked and blocked HA show 3 thermal transitions by DSC (with 2 transitions below 80 ~C); however, urea unfolding shows only 2 transitions by UV difference spectroscopy (UV-DS) and only 1 transition by changes in intrinsic tryptophan (trp) fluorescence, which corresponds to the transition observed by UV-DS at lower urea concentrations. Monitoring the heat induced unfolding of the unblocked and blocked proteins up to 80 ~C by means of circular dichroism, UV-DS, and intrinsic trp fluorescence also shows 2 transitions, which can be detected by taking the first derivative of the progress curve and which correlate with Td(1) and Td(2) determined by DSC. The result of the fluorescence experiments is unanticipated since HA contains a single trp in domain II. However, crystallographic data show contacts between it and residues in other domains thereby making the perturbation of this chromophore during the unfolding of different regions feasible. These data also suggest burial of the trp; this is affirmed by our inability to oxidize this group with N- bromosuccinimide. Recently, we commenced a study of the effects of the binding of Cl- on thermal denaturation. Albumin undergoes a number of pH induced transitions (i.e. N-F, F-E, N-B, and B-A), and a major goal of this work is to elucidate the regions of the molecule involved in these transitions and the energetics of the interactions among these regions. \",\n",
       " 'Colloidal volume expanders are used to maintain normal plasma volume and blood pressure in patients. Each of these expanders, e.g. dextran, has a distribution of molecular weights (MW\\'s). Mn determines oncotic pressure. Until now, Mw has been easier to determine than Mn, and, thus, has been used primarily. A new SEC-HPLC method permits facile measurement of both MW\\'s. Some clinicians erroneously attribute the expansion properties of dextran to \"water binding capacity\" and claim that oncotic pressure is independent of Mn. To clarify the issue, we have used osmotic pressure data from CBER and the literature to show that the oncotic effect of dextran is correctly predicted by Mn. The dextrans for which osmotic pressures were considered range in Mn from 24,000 to 375,000. 3 osmotic or virial coefficients (Mn, B2, and B3) provide a sufficient mathematical representation of the osmotic properties of each of these dextrans alone. We have found that B2 is a function of Mn, in accord with theory, whereas B3 is independent of Mn thereby yielding universal values for B2 and B3. These universal virial coefficients successfully reproduce experimental osmotic pressures for all these dextrans over a concentration range of 5-60 mg mL with a small RMS deviation. These Mn values, concentrations, and pressures include those dextrans (and concentrations) for which a water binding mechanism has been ascribed. Such a mechanism is clearly not only superfluous but incorrect. Furthermore, with limited data for the Dextran 70 and 40 products, we have been able to reproduce the experimental MW distribution, i.e. the SEC-HPLC elution profile determined during MW determinations, from Mw and Mn values only thereby providing a further rationale for using both Mw and Mn to characterize these products. Additionally, with reliable clinical data indicating average volumes of each product per kg of body mass required for fluid resuscitation, the universal virial coefficients may permit a determination of the nominal MW cut-off of the vascular bed for the dextrans. Such cut-off information would be useful in estimating the effective in vivo Mn values and, therefore, the oncotic pressure that develops as the result of the infusion of the drug product. In addition, we are, currently, endeavoring to improve a non-linear least squares fitting program that is a critical part of the SEC-HPLC methodology that is to be used to determine Mw and Mn. ',\n",
       " 'Cytokine Release as a Mechanism Mediating IGIV Adverse Reactions Basil Golding, M.D., Medical Officer, Plasma Derivatives Laboratory, OBRR T helper cell can be divided into different subsets based on the cytokines they secrete following stimulation. Thus ThO cells secrete IL-4 and IFNg, Th1 cells release IL-2 and IFNg and Th2 cells produce IL-4, and IL-5. In addition to T cells, monocytes macrophages secrete cytokines such as IL-12, TNFa and IL-1. These cytokines play important roles in immune responses but have also been implicated in adverse effects following the use of immunoglobulins (IG) and antibodies against T cells used to induce immunosuppression. We have studied these cytokines during immune responses to different conjugates in mice. Peptides or proteins were covalently linked to heat-inactivated Brucella abortus (BA) and to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). BA induced IL-12 and IFNg, whereas KLH elicited IL-4. Consequently the IgG isotype patterns evoked corresponded to the cytokines such that KLH immunization was associated with IgG1>IgG2a ratio, whereas BA elicited IgG2a>IgG1. Similar patterns were observed when BA was administered together with ovalbumin (ova) and alum. In contrast to ova + alum given alone, the combination of BA and ova + alum was associated with IL-12 and IFNg mRNA and protein induction. The isotype patterns observed following ova + alum were high titers of IgG1 and IgE, whereas in the presence of BA, IgG2a predominated and IgG1 and IgE levels were suppressed. BA was also studied for effects on human cells in culture. It had been shown to induce IFNg from human T cells. BA induced IL-12 from human monocytes as shown by increased p40 mRNA and protein. Functional IL-12 was elicited since supernatants from BA-stimulated monocytes caused T cells to secrete IFNg, and this could be blocked by addition of anti-IL-12 antibody. BA also increased expression of B7.1 and B7.2 on human monocytes. These molecules are costimulatory molecules involved in stimulation of T cells. IG preparations were shown to induce IL-1, TNFa and IL-6 from human monocytes. This ability was abrogated by passage of these preparation over polymyxin columns which were shown to remove lipopolysaccharide as determined by limulus amebocyte assays. These studies suggest that the small amounts of LPS contained in IG preparations can elicit cytokines that may explain frequently observed side effects such as fever chills, and headache. ',\n",
       " \"Allergic or hypersensitivity responses to IGIV commonly occur. Most of these reactions consist of fever, chills, dyspnea, hives or angioedema. Rarer, but more dangerous anaphylactic reactions can also occur especially in patients with selective IgA deficiency. These immediate allergic reactions are typically mediated by the recipient's IgE antibodies. Thus allergic reactions to biologics, such as IGIV constitute an important problem when the patient must receive repeated treatments. We have developed a mouse model to determine whether IgE responses to a complex protein can be prevented or down-regulated. Immunoglobulin isotype switching to IgE in human and murine B cells is induced by antigen- specific Th2 cells which secrete IL-4. In contrast, Th1 cells, which secrete IL-2 and IFN-g promote IgG2a antibodies in mice. We have developed a mouse model to investigate whether stimulation of Th1 cells can limit allergic reactions by down-regulating Th1 responses. Heat-killed Brucella Abortus (BA) was used as a Th1-promoting adjuvant in an attempt to suppress IgE responses generated by immunization with an allergenic mixture of ovalbumin + alum (0 A). We found that i) BA prevented IgE responses and markedly enhanced IgG2a when given with 0 A, ii) IgG2a enhancement was IL-12 dependent, whereas IgE inhibition was not IL-12 independent and iii) established anti-ova IgE responses could be suppressed with BA+O A (J. Immunol. 159:107-116, 1997). In a follow-up study we investigated what alternative pathway may account for the BA effect on down-regulating IgE. Th2 responses, such as those to 0 A are dependent on co-stimulation of CD28 on T cells via B7.2 on antigen-presenting-cells (APC). In contrast, Th1 stimulation appears to be dependent on interaction between B7.I on APC and CD28 on T cells. In order to determine whether BA could alter expression of co-stimulatory molecules and thereby down-regulate Th2 responses, we studied the effect of BA on co-stimulatory molecules in this system. We found that BA up-regulates B7.2 molecules on B cells (maximum at 24 h), but has no effect on B7.I. Interestingly, we demonstrated that BA increases expression of B7.2 on T cells (maximal at 42 h) and down- regulates expression of CD28 on T cells (maximal at 40 h). These findings may explain the observed effects of BA on the Th2 response, since down- regulation of CD28 may inhibit interaction between B7.2 on APC and CD28 on T cells. Unlike the Th2 response, the Th1 response was unaffected by the alteration in co-stimulatory molecules suggesting that Th1 stimulation is less dependent on this pathway, at least in the case of BA stimulation. In any event, these data provide an explanation for the ability of BA to inhibit IgE responses in an IL-12 independent fashion. They also suggest an approach that can be used to avoid allergic reactions to plasma derivatives by blocking interactions via CD28 on T cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL1-b, and IL-6 have been implicated as a cause of hypersensitivity symptoms. Bacterial cell wall constituents, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid are known to stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine release in vitro from human monocytes. Recent studies have also shown that bacterial DNA (bDNA) and oligonucleotides containing specific bDNA sequences also detect bDNA in IGIV using a sensitive PCR method with primers specific for bacterial rRNA-encoding DNA sequences. Dose response experiments suggest that the amount of bDNA contained in IGIV is not sufficient to cause release of inflammatory cytokines. We plan to test DNA content of other CBER products to determine whether the levels could stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines. \",\n",
       " 'We continued to investigate the risk of hepatitis C transmission by one lot of intramuscular immune globulin(IG) containing a low level of HCV RNA but devoid of anti-HCV. In collaboration with the CDC, ca. 200 recipients of the 10 lot in two health clinics were retrospectively evaluated. Anti- HCV was found positive in 3.1% recipients. HCV RNA testing, genotyping, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were subsequently performed. However, our results fail to establish a causal relationship between the 10 lot and its recipients. We also continued to perform HCV RNA testing in IGIM lots not yet subjected to validated viral clearance procedures in their manufacture. In addition, we participated in three collaborative studies with WHO NIBSC to establish international standards for HCV RNA, anti-HAV, and anti-HCV reagents. A specific nested PCR procedure to detect human Parvovirus B 19 DNA in plasma derivatives has been developed. The effects of different manufacturing procedures on the levels of B 19 DNA in factor VIII concentrates are being evaluated. ',\n",
       " 'To assess the presence of neutralizing antibodies for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in an experimental intravenous immune globulin (IGIV) preparation enriched in antibodies to HCV, the residual infectivity of an HCV inoculum was measured using two chimpanzees (see Z01 BQ04015-01). The experimental chimpanzee received 1 mL of a diluted H-strain HCV inoculum containing 64 CID50 pre-incubated in vitro with an IGIV prepared solely from anti- HCV EIA-2 reactive plasma units and had relatively high levels of antibodies to HCV envelope proteins (E1 and E2) while the control chimpanzee received the same inoculum preincubated with a commercial IGIV prepared from EIA -2 screened plasma and devoid of both anti-E1 and anti-E2. Both IGIVs were solvent detergent (S D) treated. 17 months post infusion, neither chimpanzee showed signs of HCV infection, i.e., elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and presence of HCV RNA in their weekly serum specimens. Anti- HCV was only detected in sera of the experimental chimpanzee due to passive immunization; at weeks one through seven post infusion, with peak titers of 1:8 at weeks one through four. The lack of infectivity in the control chimpanzee might be due to the low titer of the inoculum used. We need to repeat the same experiment using an H inoculum standardized for low infectivity (provided by Dr. R. Purcell of NIH). Previously (see Z01 04017-01 LPLD ) we set up EIAs to measure anti- E1and anti- E2 using partially purified glycoproteins derived from baculovirus constructs, HCV - Bac 3 and HCV - Bac 5, respectively. However, HCV - Bac 5 not only can express E2 fusion protein but also a full-length E1. The E1 did not react with any plasma or IGIV tested in Western blots and hence was assumed not to be reactive in EIA which utilizes the native form of proteins from HCV-Bac 5. An experimental anti-E2 EIA kit (kindly provided by Abbott Laboratories) was subsequently employed. The results were similar to those obtained with our EIA using proteins from HCV - Bac 5. Thus, data support that anti- HCV screening reduced levels of both anti- E1 and anti- E2 in plasma and the resulting immune globulins. Our previous thermal stability studies of albumin demonstrated no difference in the stabilization of a 5% albumin solution between the current albumin products using both caprylate (CA) and acetyltryptophanate (AT) at 0.08 mmole g albumin each and the use of CA alone. A manufacturer recently submitted the conformance lots and has since been approved for producing three formulations (5, 20, 25%) of Albumin (Human) containing only CA as a single stabilizer. Several such lots along with the corresponding parent lots containing both CA and AT were evaluated by HPLC for monitoring molecular integrity. All were within the specification which we established for albumin and immune globulin products, i.e., monomer + dimer greater than 90%. We have also performed similar HPLC analyses for an IGIV product by one manufacturer and various intramuscular immunoglobulin products by two manufacturers because of their introduction of a S D incubation step for improved viral safety of their products. All revised products had little or no aggregates and fragments and met the specifications. Stability studies of these new products are ongoing to ensure that the performed similar HPLC analyses for an IGIV product by one manufacturer and various intramuscular immunoglobulin products by two manufacturers because of their introduction of a S D incubation step for improved viral safety of their products. All revised products had little or no aggregates and fragments and met the specifications. Stability studies of these new products are ongoing to ensure that the molecular integrity will be maintained throughout the dating period. ',\n",
