       "\"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The EMERGEncy ID NET program is a sentinel network of 11 geographically-diverse, university-affiliated hospital emergency departments in the United States. This program, which has been funded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) since 1995, was established to address the threat of emerging infectious diseases by assessing disease prevalence, risk factors, and management practices for acute presentations from the community among a diverse population presenting to emergency departments. EMERGEncy ID NET has prospectively conducted several investigations, most recently addressing uropathogen antimicrobial resistance and outcomes among patients with acute pyelonephritis; specific host gene responses to infections; emergency physicians' (EPs) attitudes towards smallpox vaccination and perceived risk of a bioterrorist threat; and the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among patients with skin and soft tissue infections. The specific aim for the EMERGEncy ID NET program is to continue collaboration with the CDC to conduct ongoing investigations of various emerging infections in the United States. This will be accomplished by: 1) identifying emerging infections among emergency department patients; 2) developing study objectives and materials; 3) obtaining necessary approvals to conduct the research from Human Subject Protection Committees; 4) implementing the studies through enrollment and follow-up of emergency department patients; 5) managing data collected; 6) generating results from studies and reporting our findings in peer-reviewed publications and at scientific conferences. The accomplishments of the EMERGEncy ID NET program over the past 10 years demonstrate its capability to rapidly address a variety of urgent public health infectious disease problems and propagate the results of investigations effectively to infectious diseases, public health, and emergency medicine Practitioners, and to the public.

Maryland became a national EIP network member site in 1997, and over the ensuing seven years, has developed into a mature partnership capable of performing active, laboratory-based surveillance using defined surveillance populations, conducting epidemiologic and laboratory infectious disease-related activities, and responding rapidly to emerging infectious disease threats. The MD EIP proposes to continue its collaboration with CDC, other federal partners, and other EIP sites to asess the public health impact of, and respond to, emerging infections. Specifically, the MD EIP will participate in Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs), Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), surveillance for respiratory diseases and syndromes, rapid population surveys, and human genomics-related activities. With few exceptions, the catchment area for each of these activities will be the entire State. The MD EIP also proposes to provide leadership in the development of geographic information systems and spatial analytic models for the visualization of surveillance data, generation of hypotheses, and description of the codistributions of risk factors and pathogens. The MD EIP will continue to enhance its capacity to quickly respond to newly emerging infectious disease issues by continuing to cross-train EIP staff and stengthen relationships with other partners (e.g. public health preparedness and response). A variety of training opportunities will also be provided for infection control practitioners, laboratorians, local health department staff, medical residents, and public health graduate students.',\n",

       " \"The Emerging Infections Programs in Georgia will be divided into two population areas, the Atlanta Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)and the Georgia outside Atlanta (GOA). The project will consist of 3 main components: Active Bacterial Core (ABCs), FoodNet and Acute Respiratory Disease Studies (ARDS). Within ABCs and FoodNet, active surveillance for specific organisms will be done, and multi-site projects related to disease etiology and risk factors will be developed, conducted, analyzed and published. Syndromic surveillance projects for evaluation of tools such as the rash illness algorithm, and identification of SARS-like illnesses among healthcare workers will also be conducted. The EIP concept allows in-depth study of diseases and risk factors- multiple state involvement allows an increase in sample size, thus increased statistical power to examine differences between groups, and examination of differences in incidence and risk factors by geographic area and demographic group. The collaboration between state and local health departments, the CDC, USDA, FDA and other federal agencies and multiple academic institutions is strength of the EIP. Studies are developed, piloted, conducted and analyzed with input and expertise from collaborators at all levels of government and academia. This broad input results in scientifically rigorous studies which often have practical, applied public health imptications for intervention+ Georgia has a long history of good performance in the EIP. Georgia's diverse population, unique health problems and high-quality, experienced staff make the Georgia EIP a strong partner for CDC.\",\n",
       " 'Increasing knowledge about emerging infections, including strategies to prevent and control them, is a critical public health priority. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) seeks to continue its contribution to national and international work on emerging infections though Emerging Infections Program (EIP) activities including active bacterial core surveillance (ABCs) and MRSA projects; active surveillance for foodborne diseases (FoodNet); surveillance for respiratory diseases and syndromes; providing a rapid, flexible response to emerging problems; collaborating on the rapid population-based survey capacity activity; conducting integrated hepatitis surveillance for viral hepatitis, conducting surveillance for unexplained deaths and critical illness; conducting training activities; and participating in EIP genomics risk factor activities. Further, MDH will engage in additional site-specific activities including a neurodegenerative disease program and acting as a Regional PFGE Coordinating Center. Methods utilized for these activities include surveillance (including active statewide surveillance and sentinel site surveillance; both laboratory-based and syndromic); epidemiologic surveillance and investigations using molecular and microbiologic laboratory analysis; ease- control studies, cohort studies, and piloting and evaluation of prevention and intervention projects. Aims of MDH EIP include: (1) providing scientific leadership in EIP activities; (2) collaborating with CDC and other EIP sites as part of a national network of EIPs; (3) maintaining flexibility and infrastructure to rapidly Irespond to emerging infectious disease issues as they arise; (4) managing, analyzing, and interpreting data collected through EIP activities; and (5) disseminating information from EIP projects to health care providers, public health partners, and the scientific community through multiple mechanisms including scientific imeetings and publications. Because of MDH\\'s decade of experience with EIP projects, effective operating structures and partnerships are established. Thus, with this application, MDH is in a position to build on existing expertise when implementing new EIP projects such as Surveillance for Respiratory Diseases and Syndromes. MDH EIP activities address the \"Healthy People 2010\" focus area(s) of Immunization and Infectious Diseases, and the performance goal of the CDC National Center for Infectious Diseases to \"Protect Americans from infectious diseases.\"',\n",
       " 'Governments in Africa are beginning to deploy expensive combination treatments for malaria, still the most frequent cause of childhood death on the continent. It is not clear whether these drugs should be made as widely available as possible through public and private sector channels where they can be easily obtained, or if they should be restricted to formal health facilities where their use can be regulated. Phase one (Year 1) of this work will complete an evaluation of the public health impact of delivering these medicines at health facilities only. In Phase two (Years 2-5), we propose to: 1. Compare morbidity & mortality benefits derived from either a community- or a facility-based management strategy for febrile illness, 2. Compare cost- effectiveness and other economic indicators of a community- or facility-based management strategy for febrile illness, 3. establish the effect of ACT deployment strategy on development/ spread of drug resistance, and 4. Compare sociobehavioral and policy indicators and implications of febrile illness and other common illnesses, especially pneumonia. This proposed evaluation will provide evidence needed to maximize the public health benefit that the introduction of these new medicines can effect. The evaluation will contribute directly to priority areas identified by CDC in \"Protecting the Nation\\'s Health in an Era of Globalization\", namely: 1. applied research on diseases of global importance, 2. application of proven public health tools, 3. global initiatives for disease control, and 4. public health training and capacity building. The overall research design is a population level comparison of the two strategies implemented as effectively as possible in a 3 district area in Tanzania. Unlike experimental research, this work will examine the two strategies in realistic settings of public health service provision in Africa. It relies on public and private sector partnership as well as linking public health practice with clinical recommendations and regulatory implementation. The evaluation is strengthened by a design that seeks evidence from multiple scientific disciplines in order to establish an adequate base of evidence.',\n",
       " 'The proposal aims at addressing the burden of disease, risk factorsfor and potential to intervene against  neonatal and maternalperi-partum sepsis in a developingcountry setting with a high prevalence(29%)of  maternal HIV infection. The study site is a secondary-tertiary hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa.  The primary aim of this proposal is to complete a currently underwaydouble-blind randomizedplacebo  controlled trial studying the efficacy of chlorhexidine (0.5% solution) intavaginal washes during labor in the  mother and subsequentcleansing of the newborn with full-body chlorhexidine wipes, to prevent early -onset  (within 72 hours of birth) neonatal sepsis and peri-partum (within 14 days of birth) sepsis in the mother.  Based on an estimatedincidence rate of 30 cases of sepsis/1000 life births occuring within 72 hours of birth,  we proposeto randomise 8 000 women during labor into one of two arms (chlorhexidine vs. autoclaved tap-  water inetnmittent vaginal washes) to detect at least a 40% reduction in the incidence of neonatal sepsis, with  80% power and 95% confidence. The study-outcome measureof neonatalsepsiswill include culture  confirmed disease and/or a clinical diagnosis of sepsis based on an algorithm that has been agreed upon by  experts in the field. We also plan to measure in a subset of mother-infant pairs the prevalence of vaginal  colonisation by bacteria in the mother during labor and the impact of the study-intervention on the incidence  of colonisation of the newborn with vaginal bacterial flora.  The study will evaluate the effect of the intervention on the incidence of the following specificoutcomes:  Primary objectives: 1. Early (within 72 hours of birth) microbiologiocally confirmed and/ or clinically  diagnosed neonatalsepsis. 2. Decrease in vertical transmission of colonization with Group B Streptococcus  from the mother to the newborn. Secondary objectives: 1. Incidence of community-acquired neonatal  sepsis/meningitis between72 hours and 28 days of life. 2. Incidence of peripartum culture-confirmedor  clinically diagnosed maternal sepsis within 14 days fo birth. 3. Incidence of colonization of the newbornwith  Klebsiela pneumoniaeand E . coli. 4. The burden of disease and risk factors for maternal peripartum  infection and serious neonatal infections in SouthAfrica with emphasis on the impact of maternalHIV  infection on these outcomeswill also be studied. Relevance: The findings from this study may contribute in  sari to realising one of the Millenium goals of the United Nations; i.e. to halve childhood mortality by2015. The leading cause of neonatal deaths, which contribute to at least one-third of all infant deaths, in developing countries are sepsis and birth asphyxia. Logistical and resource constraints in developing countries prohibit the implementation of strategies that have been successfully in developed countries to reduce neonatal sepsis, therefore a more practical and affordable solution is required for developing countries.  PERFORMANCE S(TE(S) (organization, city, state) University of Witwatersrand/Medical Research Council Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens ResearchUnit Chris Hani Baragwananth Hospital, Old Potch Road, Soweto, Gauteng, South Africa The study is to be done in Soweto, which is situated in central South Africa in a province called Gauteng. This is an urban African township with an estimated population of 1.2-1.5 million people in an area of 78 square kilometers. Soweto is the largest Arican township in South Africa and has 29 districts with approxiamtely 50-300 000 people residing in each district. Most residents reside in a variety of dwellings ranging from single sex hostels and informal shack settlements (26%) to formal brick housing (58%). Residents in Soweto have access to potable water in their yards (59%), or homes (35%), or community taps (6%). One in 10 adults in Soweto has no formal education and a quarter have a maximum of seven years of education. Nearly 42% of adult Sowetans are unemployed. The community has been highly affected by HIV, with 30% of pregnant women that attend antenatal clinics testing positive for HIV. Annually there are 30000 births in the area, with at least 18 000 of these occuring at the only public hospital in the area, viz. Chri Hani- Baragwanath hsoprtal (CHBH). Over 90% of expectant mothers have at least one antenatal visit prior to delivering, of whom more than 95% consnet to HIVtesting. Health care for expectant mothers and their newboms is free of charge at all government hearth facilities.

Joint research activities include 1) studies of malaria in pregnancy including: a) provision of technical support to WHO/SEARO and the Indian Malaria Research Council (MRC) to document the burden of malaria in pregnancy (MiP) in Asia and b) evaluate the safety and efficacy of existing and new antimalarial combinations in the treatment and prevention of malaria in children and pregnant women through multi- centre efficacy trials in Africa and Asia, and by use of meta-analyses of existing trial data. 2) studies in young children to define the role of effective initial antimalarial treatment and the additional benefits of monthly Intermittent Preventive Therapy during the post-discharge period (IPTpd) in the prevention of rebound severe malaria anaemia and mortality in young children in sub-Saharan Africa; and 3) studies of the interaction between HIV and malaria to a) determine the potential for drug-drug interactions between antimalarials, ARVs and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in HIV-infected non-pregnant and pregnant individuals in sub-Saharan Africa, and b) to determine the impact of successful control of malaria on HIV-disease Drogression rates in HIV-infected adult individuals in sub-Saharan Africa.  Capacity development of local collaborative research groups will be an important component of research activities, through formal training of local investigators and health officials involved in collaborative research and 'on-the-job' training for all categories of staff in relevant areas such as good clinical practice.  As part of these activities a Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) research working group will be established in collaboration with WHO and CDC and several other leading research groups to guide the research agenda and expedite the identification, evaluation and implementation of MiP control strategies in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The secretariat will be based at the LSTM.\",\n",

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The EMERGEncy ID NET program is a sentinel network of 11 geographically-diverse, university-affiliated hospital emergency departments in the United States. This program, which has been funded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) since 1995, was established to address the threat of emerging infectious diseases by assessing disease prevalence, risk factors, and management practices for acute presentations from the community among a diverse population presenting to emergency departments. EMERGEncy ID NET has prospectively conducted several investigations, most recently addressing uropathogen antimicrobial resistance and outcomes among patients with acute pyelonephritis; specific host gene responses to infections; emergency physicians' (EPs) attitudes towards smallpox vaccination and perceived risk of a bioterrorist threat; and the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among patients with skin and soft tissue infections. The specific aim for the EMERGEncy ID NET program is to continue collaboration with the CDC to conduct ongoing investigations of various emerging infections in the United States. This will be accomplished by: 1) identifying emerging infections among emergency department patients; 2) developing study objectives and materials; 3) obtaining necessary approvals to conduct the research from Human Subject Protection Committees; 4) implementing the studies through enrollment and follow-up of emergency department patients; 5) managing data collected; 6) generating results from studies and reporting our findings in peer-reviewed publications and at scientific conferences. The accomplishments of the EMERGEncy ID NET program over the past 10 years demonstrate its capability to rapidly address a variety of urgent public health infectious disease problems and propagate the results of investigations effectively to infectious diseases, public health, and emergency medicine Practitioners, and to the public.

       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long term goal is to establish animal models for human influenza infection, pathogenesis, transmission and evolution. There is particular concern about the possibility that avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype could lead to a pandemic. These viruses are transmitting directly from birds to humans, although they have been unable yet to maintain sustained human-to-human transmission. We propose to study the mechanisms that avian influenza viruses require to infect mammals as well as the potential evolution of those viruses to transmit human-to-human which is required to cause a pandemic. The molecular basis for the efficient transmission of influenza viruses from among humans is not well understood, although the aerosol transmission is known to be important in the process. With the emergence of direct transmission of influenza viruses from avian species to humans but little human-to-human transmission, it is crucial to determine the genetic traits that lead to efficient transmission of potentially pandemic viruses in humans. We propose two specific aims to address: 1) The transmissibility potential of human H1, H2, and H3 viruses as well as avian H5, H7, and H9 viruses that have been implicated in bird-to-human infections. We will determine the effect of particle size for efficient aerosol spread and the effect that virus morphology has to establish a natural chain of transmission in the ferret model. We will compare the effect of influenza infections in two animal model systems, the ferret and the cotton rat, both of which can display typical flu symptoms without requiring virus adaptation. We will use unrestrained whole body plethysmography to determine the frequency of respiration, airway responsiveness (ratio of inspiration to expiration) and time between breaths and compare them with the effect of aerosolization of influenza virus particles. We will study virus survival in sputum samples of infected ferrets to better understand the natural conditions that might affect the stability of the virus and its effect for efficient transmission. 2) We will generate avian/human reassortant influenza viruses by reverse genetics or by co-infection of ferrets with an avian and a human strain to determine whether such reassortants are viable and better define the factors that control transmission of avian influenza viruses in this animal model system.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous pathogen, and causes infections of the skin, bloodstream, lung, and other body sites. Community-acquired methicillin resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) infections, which were previously extremely rare, are now occurring commonly worldwide. CA-MRSA is the most common cause of skin infection in many locales in the U.S., including Southern California. CA-MRSA strains are notable for their ability to spread in closed settings and cause recurrent infections among healthy persons. Management of recurrent CA-MRSA infection is challenging and optimal prevention strategies are undefined. Many experts recommend topical agents that decontaminate the body and/or anterior nares. Others suggest environmental decontamination to help control recurrences and transmission within households. However, there are no data that quantify the efficacy and safety of these approaches. We will conduct a multi-center clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of body and environmental decolonization regimens in the prevention of CA-MRSA infection. The study population will comprise of persons suffering from recurrent CA-MRSA infection. This investigation will partner investigators with extensive experience studying CA-MRSA infection with investigators from Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large Health Maintenance Organization that is a leader in the use of electronic medical records. For this clinical trial, all subjects will be randomized in a 2 x 2 design to test: 1) chlorhexidine body washes plus nasal mupirocin ointment vs. usual care, and 2) environmental cleansing with ethanol spray and aggressive laundering vs. no environmental cleansing. We will also conduct complementary investigations, including studying the interventions' efficacy at preventing infections in household members, modeling oredictors of recurrent CA-MRSA infection, and measuring pharmaco-economic outcomes. We will also examine strain relatedness of colonizing and infecting CA-MRSA strains to better understand colonization dynamics within households. Our clinical trial will forward our understanding of the benefit of decolonization regimens at preventing A-MRSA infection. Additionally, our studies will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis and scope of recurrent CA-MRSA infection.   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",
       " \"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Broad objectives: To study the community transmission dynamics of influenza in a subtropical city state. Specific aims of this proposal: To assess the efficacy of face masks and/or hand hygiene in reducing household transmission of influenza. Summary of proposed study: Design and subjects: A cluster randomized controlled trial of 1,477 households where one resident has symptoms of influenza-like-illness (index patient). The 1,477 households will include 1,477 index patients and 4,136 'secondary contacts'. After recruitment of an index patient, a study nurse will visit the household to administer the intervention, and will revisit after 3, 6 and 9 days. We will conduct an initial pilot involving 120 households to confirm feasibility and logistics before implementation of the main study. Interventions: 1, placebo (educational talk on upper respiratory tract illness self-care); 2, placebo plus distribution of free masks and education on their use; 3, placebo plus distribution of alcohol hand rubs/dispensers and education on hand hygiene; 4, placebo plus face masks and alcohol rubs/dispensers hand hygiene interventions. Instruments: Initial assessment of influenza in an index patient will be made using the QuickVue rapid diagnostic test. Clinical influenza in secondary contacts will be assessed by self-reported symptoms. Nose and throat swabs will be collected from index patients and secondary contacts for laboratory confirmation of influenza. Main outcome measures: The proportion of secondary contacts with influenza (laboratory definition where samples are available, otherwise clinical definition) during the 10 days following randomization. Relevance: The results of this study will have important implications for influenza prevention in the community locally and globally. Moreover in light of recent fears of a new influenza pandemic, our results will inform public health policy on non-pharmaceutical interventions in a subtropical Chinese setting.         \",\n",
       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The effectiveness in reducing influenza occurrence with use of face masks worn alone, or layered with hand hygiene will be evaluated in a randomized intervention. The study will be carried out among University of Michigan students living in University housing. Randomization will be by housing unit. In the first year, 750 students will be recruited to use face masks alone, 750 will use face masks and hand hygiene, and 750 will serve as an observed comparison group. Total number of participants will 2,250. Two small dormitories, 6 larger ones, and one complex with 10 component units have been identified as suitable for the study. Students living in each of the residence halls will be asked if they wish to participate in the study. Those giving informed consent will be asked to complete a survey each week to ascertain illness occurrence. When influenza illness is documented to be occurring in the University setting, the interventions will be implemented. During that period, the survey will be expanded to include questions on intervention use, as appropriate to the particular housing unit. Also during this period, those with illnesses meeting a case definition will be asked to provide specimens for the virus identification. This collection will not be limited to those agreeing to the use of the interventions. All living in the participating housing units will be eligible, after they give informed consent. With this sample size, it will be possible to detect a 40% reduction between those in an intervention group and the control group. Such a reduction could have a major public health impact during a pandemic. In the second year, the study can be expanded or modified based on findings in the first.            ',\n",
       " \"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There were three recognized influenza pandemics in the 20th century, and historical experience suggests that another influenza pandemic is all but inevitable. Although 'colds' and seasonal influenza are clinically very different diseases from pandemic influenza, they share common transmission pathways and the community-level interventions needed to reduce both seasonal flu, common viral URIs and pandemic influenza are likely to be similar. In addition, the circulating influenza viruses causing seasonal flu are physically identical to pandemic influenza viruses, and therefore should be a good model for testing interventions before a pandemic emerges. Little research has been conducted to identify influenza prevention strategies at the household level. Hence, specific aims of this project are to compare the impact of two household-level interventions (an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with or without face masks) on six outcomes: incidence and types or strains of virologically confirmed influenza occurring in study households; rates of symptoms of influenza and viral URIs; basic reproduction number (R0), i.e. number of secondary cases generated by a single infected person in a fully susceptible household; antibiotic use practices for symptoms of influenza and other viral URIs; household member knowledge of prevention and  treatment strategies for pandemic influenza and viral URIs; and rates of influenza vaccination among household members. 450 households in northern Manhattan (primarily recently immigrated Hispanics) will be randomized to three groups: control (receiving only a pamphlet on influenza prevention), alcohol hand sanitizer, and sanitizer plus face masks. Symptoms of influenza will be monitored daily for 15 months using  ecological momentary assessment technology. Virologic cultures will be obtained from persons with flu symptoms (fever >100 degrees F., sore throat and/or cough). Antibiotic use practices, knowledge, and vaccination rates will be assessed by survey using pilot-tested, psychometrically sound instruments. For this cluster randomization design with randomized intervention on the household level, outcomes will be measured at the individual and household level using generalized linear mixed model for counts response with a Poisson distribution and other appropriate multivariate techniques to control for confounding.            \",\n",
       " \"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to generate evidence to inform non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for pandemic influenza. We are proposing three parts to our research: 1. Preventing pandemic entry into island countries - This component would review historic evidence about successes and failures with control of the 1918, 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics entry into island countries and lessons that can be learned from this. It would assess the feasibility of using known NPI to exclude pandemic influenza from island countries of varying size, from continental islands (Australia) to medium sized islands (NZ, Fiji), to small islands (e.g. American Samoa, Marshall Islands). This information would be incorporated into a 'threshold analysis' tool for use by health and border authorities. 2. Seasonal influenza prevalence in airline passengers - This component would measure the prevalence of influenza like illness (ILI) and infection in arriving passengers according to origins and travel times and estimate the proportion who are incubating disease. It would also assess the positive predictive value of a short screening questionnaire. 3. Seasonal influenza hospitalizations and housing conditions - This component would measure rates of hospitalization with influenza in an established cohort of 225,000 people living in public housing in New Zealand. It would specifically measure the risk of influenza in relation to age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, household crowding levels and tobacco smoke exposure. Results of these related projects would inform pandemic influenza prevention in a number of ways:   -Results would support decision-making about the feasibility of preventing pandemic influenza entry into island countries and the combination of NPIs that are likely to be most effective at achieving this.   - Data on the prevalence of influenza in passengers from various origins and flying times would provide an important input for decisions about the efficacy of traveler exclusion, quarantine and screening. Results could also be contrasted with the patterns seen in Northern Hemisphere sites.   - Findings from the housing cohort would be used to guide advice about reducing influenza transmission in households, particularly in terms of crowding levels and exposure to active and passive smoking.            \",\n",
       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to fill a crucial gap in our knowledge of how influenza is transmitted by characterizing the virus aerosols generated from the respiratory tract of persons naturally infected with human influenza and concurrently determine the ability of readily available personal protective equipment (masks) to mitigate transmission of these infectious particles at the source of generation. Pandemic influenza in 1918, 1957, and 1968 produced widespread morbidity and mortality; in 1918 extensive infection resulted in disruption within communities and breakdown of essential services. Current strategies for limiting a pandemic include use of   vaccines, antiviral medications, and because of the lag time for vaccine production, limited supply of antivirals, and explosive pandemic transmission, widespread application of social distancing is also anticipated. Designing effective social distancing interventions requires detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of influenza transmission. Epidemiologic and experimental evidence suggests that influenza is transmitted to a large degree via the airborne route. However, no definitive information is available on the size distribution or rate of infectious particle release by influenza patients, and no studies have examined how to control release or dissemination of influenza aerosols. This project addresses community mitigation and protective measures directed at the spread of influenza virus. The results of this study will have implications on simple and low tech interventions applicable in both the United States and countries in other stages of development. This project is organized around tests of the following hypotheses:    (1) Exhaled breath of influenza patients contains airborne viral particles and the size and number of infectious particles is a function of respiratory maneuver (tidal breathing, talking, coughing). (2) Infectious particles have relatively large aerodynamic diameters as they exit the nose and mouth, and surgical masks worn by infected patients can capture a significant portion them. The information gathered by this project will provide a firm scientific basis for effective public health interventions that will be necessary during potential upcoming influenza pandemics to protect communities and prevent widespread economic and social disruption while limiting the spread of infection.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Freehold Area Health Department proposes a multi-faceted approach designed to evaluate the efficacy of selected plant-derived natural products to control tick vectors of Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne illness in the United States. Identification of all-natural, low toxicity chemicals extracted from botanical sources that are toxic to nymphal Ixodes scapularis (Objective 1) through comprehensive reviews of pertinent literature and collaboration with the Department of Forest Products, Oregon State University and the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nootkatone showed promise in New Jersey field trials and will be the initial plant-derived acaricide (PDA) tested, but other candidate compounds with proven acaricidal activity and practically available quantities from commercial sources adequate for field testing/bioassay within the time frame of the FOA may be added. Formulation of natural products into water soluble or emulsified compounds that can be applied to vegetation and leaf litter in Lyme disease endemic regions (Objective 2) will be addressed through collaboration with Legacy BioDesign, LLC, Loveland, CO and the CDC. Field studies will test a formulation of a nootkatone-based PDA applied against host- seeking nymphal I. scapularis and Amblyomma americanum using two methods (low pressure vs. high pressure hydraulic sprayers) (Objective 3). Combined dragging and walking survey estimates of tick abundance will be compared between treated plots and untreated edge areas to evaluate whether efficacy is due to direct toxicity or spatial repellency (Objective 4). Trials in the second year of the study will test the relative effectiveness of single vs. multiple applications, the efficacy of additional PDAs, and/or testing of different dosage rates and formulations. The third year of the study will examine the potential role of PDAs in an integrated tick management (ITM) program. A comparative cost analysis will be included in the final year of the study. Assessment of the repellent activity of selected PDAs against host-seeking I. scapularis and A. americanum (Objective 5) will be made in field trials comparing repellency of nootkatone and commercially available products containing deet and permethrin. Treated tick drags and coveralls will be exposed along 100-m transects in known tick-infested habitat during the activity periods of all post-embryonic stages of host-seeking I. scapularis and A. americanum.

This zoonosis is the most prevalent vector borne infectious disease in the United States and Europe and its incidence is growing. The enzootic cycle of this pathogen requires that Ixodes spp. acquire B. burgdorferi from infected wildlife  reservoirs and transmit it to other uninfected wildlife. At present, there are no effective measures to control B. burgdorferi; there is no human vaccine available, and existing vector control measures are generally not acceptable to the public. However, if B. burgdorferi could be eliminated from its reservoir hosts or from the ticks that feed on them, the enzootic cycle would be broken, and the incidence of Lyme disease would decrease. We have developed a reservoir targeted vaccine (RTV) based on the immunogenic outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi aimed at breacking the natural cycle of this spirochete. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), a major  reservoir species for this spirochete in nature, develop a systemic anti-OspA IgG  response after vaccination, that is protective against B. burgdorferi infection upon tick challenge and clears B. burgdorferi from the tick vector (90% efficacy in the laboratory). In addition, we performed a pilot field study and determined that ingestion of this bait vaccine by P. leucopus induced a high titer of anti-OspA antibodies that blocked transmission of B. burgdorferi to the next tick cohort. The main goal of this UO1 proposal is to optimize the immunization parameters of our OspA-based RTV for P. leucopus in the laboratory, and to determine its efficacy in reducing the density of B. burgdorferi-infected ticks, and thus human Lyme disease risk, in the field.

We propose several candidate natural low-toxicity chemicals potentially toxic or repellent against I. scapularis. Working with a scientist with the USDA Agricultural Research Service, we will improve the current emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation of nootkatone and develop preliminary encapsulation techniques for this chemical using coacervation, Fantesk encapsulation, and spray dried encapsulation. Formulation samples will be screened in the laboratory at The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station for efficacy against I. scapularis and the formulations will be optimized for aqueous spray applications. Field trials will be conducted in communities in Fairfield and Litchfield Counties of Connecticut; areas with high tick densities and endemic for Lyme disease. The repellency of the new natural product candidates will be evaluated initially in the laboratory against I. scapularis. In the field, repellency of nootkatone, and other candidate natural products will be evaluated using treated and untreated flannel tick drags. In addition, we will bring several added components to the proposed project beyond the stated objectives in the funding opportunity announcement that will enhance the outputs and outcomes of the research. Chemical analysis of field samples will provide nootkatone residue-degradation data. In addition, we propose to further test the compatibility and field efficacy of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae Strain 52 with nootkatone and other natural products, which may permit effective use of lower concentrations of the natural compounds in the field for a more economical and integrated natural approach to tick control.

Major strides have been made to reduce the burden of malaria in the region, and it is imperative that this progress is not lost. Drug resistance is a constant threat with the most resistant malaria in the world found here. A key necessity for tracking progress of control, responding rapidly to outbreaks and avoiding the consequences of spreading drug resistance is to have ready access to reliable information. The goal of this project is to support countries and partners in the Greater Mekong Sub-region to put in place a robust, reliable and recent evidence base, which is continuously updated and used by the countries to refine and improve their control strategies and to mobilize resources. The Malaria Consortium will address the need through the following three specific aims: 1. Contribute to developing a comprehensive updated base of evidence on malaria burden (epidemiological, economic and social) and drug use to improve access and rational use; 2. Develop efficient systems for ongoing information management; 3. Develop regional capacity for long-term evidence collection and use for policy development and program implementation. It will achieve its aims by supporting surveys and routine data collection, improving and adapting means of obtaining information, promoting relevant research which will be rapidly taken up by practitioners and undertaking an innovative training program.

These are a multisite return-to-custody outcome study, specialized study of treatment process, and test of a community re-entry care model. With over 30 years experience in the treatment evaluation field, TCU\\'s multisite research qualifications have included developing measurement strategies and \"public domain\" instruments, evaluating treatment process and outcomes, assessing organizational structure and climate related to change, and developing and testing integrative models of dynamic relationships in time sequenced data. In addition to earlier NlDA-funded multisite projects, TCU was a collaborating research center for the Cooperative Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Studies (DATOS) project. As part of DATOS, TCU staff worked closely and effectively with other sites and NIDA to establish an administrative and decision-making system involving task-based committees, and both electronic- and paper-based communication protocols that guided and disseminated scientific accomplishments. TCU experience also includes a number of CJ evaluations during the past decade, with an emphasis on developing a portable longitudinal treatment process assessment system, designing and assessing cognitive-based therapeutic interventions appropriate for offenders, assessing the interrelated components of the treatment continuum (including continuation of treatment during community re-entry), and conducting long-term follow-up studies. Currently providing a wide variety of intensive treatment services to over 10,000 inmates in over 60 program locations, our partner, the Texas correctional system, offers a unique opportunity to study a comprehensive multi-staged treatment system involving complex cognitive and behavioral components. TDCJ is ready to assess the effectiveness of these treatment approaches across subgroups (including gender, age, race/ethnicity, rural/urban), willing to implement new interventions, and offers \"untreated\" comparison samples and the ability to use random assignment when appropriate. TCU has an excellent collaborative relationship with TDCJ. Evidence is presented in this proposal concerning the qualifications, experience, collaborative relationships, and mission of TCU and TDCJ, and our partnership will support a successful and productive CJ-DATS.

Four major research centers at the University of Miami School of Medicine have joined to contribute to the proposed DTSRC and national CJ-DATS with their considerable clinical trials, multi-site, epidemiology, criminal justice, HIV/AIDS, and drug abuse treatment research expertise (Center for Treatment Research on Adolescent Drug Abuse, Comprehensive Drug Research Center/Health Services Research Center, Drug Abuse and AIDS Research Center, and the AIDS Prevention Center). The Treatment Providers Partners (TPPs) selected are among the largest, most respected in the state. These providers offer an exceptional diversity of treatment modalities and ethnic profiles in their work with substance abusing criminal justice involved adults and juveniles. Importantly, the TPPs and Center investigators have excellent working relationships with local criminal justice professionals. The Criminal Justice Partners (CJPs), the FL Dept. of Corrections and the FL Dept. of Juvenile Justice, also provide rich settings and resources for collaborative DTSRC research studies. The DTSRC infrastructure includes an Investigative Team of diverse, internationally recognized drug abuse researchers who have developed and published efficacious family-based treatment models with drug-abusing offender populations (adolescents, adults, high HIV risk). The proposed research concepts and activities of the DTSRC are based on six fundamental themes: 1) a social ecological perspective on offender drug abuse; 2) family involvement in treatment and recovery; 3) facilitating adaptive transitions; 4) research diversity; 5) integrative interventions; and 6) juvenile justice focus. Specific research concepts proposed include a randomized trial of a multi-systems integrative family-based intervention for adolescent drug abusers in detention and as they transition into community outpatient treatment. A second concept builds on an empirically supported family-based drug treatment engagement intervention developed with women drug abusers in dependency court, and proposes to test this model with female drug abusers in detention. Clinical research teams with considerable experience in all aspects of multi-site trials will coordinate and implement research and clinical training and monitoring protocols and data management procedures in collaboration with the Coordinating Center and other Research Centers.

Yet some persons with addictive disorders do not avail themselves of treatment, or leave treatment prematurely, or do not sustain long-term benefit from treatment. Recent evidence suggests that programs and services that better integrate the treatment community with the criminal justice system are likely to yield better clinical outcomes. The Connecticut Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Service (CT CJ-DATS) Initiative will create a partnership to empirically test integrated services and treatment in Connecticut, where the judicial and correction systems are state-operated, and interagency relationships have been developing for several years. The initiative will be overseen by a state-level steering committee composed of high-level state and community agency managers, and a research team including expertise in behavioral health, economics, and criminal justice, and with experience in multi-site collaborative research. We propose two examples of studies that could be led by the CT CJ-DATS team. First, for women offenders with co-occurring trauma and drug disorders, we propose a randomized controlled trial comparing a novel group treatment approach of substance abuse and trauma treatment called TARGET, compared to substance abuse treatment alone. We hypothesize that integrated treatment for trauma and drug abuse will improve outcomes with regard to substance abuse and criminal behavior. Second, for drug dependent or drug abusing defendants referred by the court system, including probation officers, we propose to test a model treatment called Network Support, which would emphasize the development of a positive social support network. Four conditions will be compared: (1) substance abuse treatment alone; (2) substance abuse treatment with contingency management; (3) substance abuse treatment with network support; and (4) substance abuse treatment with network support and contingency management. We hypothesize that using both network support and contingency management will result in the best outcomes with respect to reduced drug use and continuous abstinence.

Kentucky provides an ideal setting to study re-entry because Kentucky is ranked in the top 3 states for increases in'the number inmates (Harrison & Beck, 2006) as well as the number of parolees (BJS, 2006). This continuation application is submitted by the University of Kentucky to further understand re-entry by continuing the Central States Center in CJ-DATS 2. Our CJ-DATS 1 Center successes include: Involvement in 7 protocols which exceeded the number by any other Center; Leading the only woman-focused protocol; Developing a true stakeholder-centered infrastructure which resulted in the innovative Kentucky Re-Entry Guidelines; Research activities which produced 26 manuscripts and 16 presentations by our team as well as data to allow other CJ-DATS 1 researchers to publish. CJ-DATS 1 also provided the infrastructure to develop a statewide outcome study and 2 NIDA grant applications. Our Center's innovative vision will uniquely contribute to the scientific knowledge on the organizational and system changes necessary to implement and sustain evidence-based interventions (APA, 2006) across a continuum of care at re-entry in diverse criminal justice and community organizational settings. Our conceptual approach draws upon selected theoretical frameworks of organizational change to implement the Center's vision and our 3 Research Concepts.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed study has grown from a collaboration of the Sharpless & Taylor laboratories to employ novel \"click chemistry\" to develop selective ligands for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor using the acetylcholine binding protein as the reaction vessel. The precursors are anchored to two sites on the receptor and contain extended azide and acetylene moieties that react by cycloaddition to form a triazole. The precursor ligands have modest affinity for the protein and react extremely slowly in solution. On the protein surface, the apposition of the reactant groups and the amphiphilic environment of the protein forces a rapid reaction leading to formation of high affinity complex. Synthesis employs combinatorial reactants, and a single or predominant product is formed that is characterized by DIOS mass spectrometry. Interestingly, this \"freezeframe\" procedure catches the complex in unanticipated conformations such that the high affinity regioisomer forms from a low abundance conformation. Initially acetylcholine binding proteins from Lymnaea and Aplysia are employed as templates to form selective nicotinic agents. By mutagenesis the template is modified to incorporate binding determinants of the a7 receptor and then the heterologous receptor subtypes found in the brain. Since this is effectively a \"freeze-frame\" reaction, conformational flexibility of the binding templates will be analyzed by decay of fluorescence anisotropy in separate studies. Complexes also offer the potential for X-ray crystallographic studies. Partal agonists and antagonists will be generated from combinatorial libraries using nicotine, epibatidine or other heterocycles or bicyclic rings as the active center and peripheral site anchoring loci. Cycloaddition products will be examined for affinity and specificity for the respective binding templates. Their selectivities will then be examined on nicotinic receptors formed from transfected receptor subunit combinations. The final stages of investigation will include studies in rodents to determine efficacy and toxicity.',\n",
       " \"Among drug dependence disorders, nicotine dependence is the most widely diffused, with a strong impact on the world's health and economy. The tobacco epidemic is a global problem; one-third of the worldwide population over 15 years of age or 1.1 billion people smoke. By the year 2025, the WHO estimates there will be 10 million tobaccorelated deaths per year worldwide. Smoking cessation treatment is highly cost-effective, and pharmacotherapy is universally recommended for treatment of nicotine dependence in the absence of specific contraindications. However, the majority of smokers do not quit even with treatment. Currently available treatments do not exploit recent advances inknowledge of neurobiologic mechanisms of addiction and reward that have made possible the development of rationally designed treatments targeting specifically those systems involved in nicotine reward circuitry. Existing and new pharmacotherapies along with prevention efforts are key to improving smoking cessation rates and reducing the premature and preventable morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco use. This RFA has prompted three organizations with longstanding interest in pharmacotherapy for nicotine dependence, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), McLean Hospital Brain Imaging Center (BIC), and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), to join forces for the proposed NCDDG-MD/NA Group. The primary objective of this group is to identify and test promising compounds that affect critical neural systems in nicotine reward and craving. In this collaborative group project for drug discovery, we will combine screening of multiple potential lead compounds, with pre-clinical and clinical testing of two compounds and in vivo brain imaging measures. Specifically, we will 1) screen multiple lead compounds in neurochemistry, electrophysiology, behavioral and animal brain imaging assays, 2) screen multiple promising compounds identified in the preclinical work in a novel human 72 hour nicotine craving paradigm, 3) perform clinical trials to test the efficacy of the most promising two compounds for smoking cessation, compared with placebo and bupropion and 4) use in vivo neuroimaging to identify surrogate markers for treatment response and relapse in humans. This effort will advance our understanding of mechanisms involved in nicotine dependence, early abstinence/treatment response and relapse, will advance our understanding of what types of agents are effective in treating nicotine dependence, will test a battery of putative surrogate markers for clinical response aimed at accelerating the process by which effective drugs can be assessed for efficacy in nicotine dependence and will test two compounds for nicotine dependence in adequately powered trials. The compounds that we will investigate will be drawn from the large, existing portfolio of compounds under development for nicotine dependence at GSK. Each organization will make a unique contribution of personnel and resources to the implementation and success of the  project.\",\n",
       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is the most important preventable cause of premature disability and death in the United States and in much of the world. In response to RFA-GM-04-002, we propose to create a Pharmacogenetics Research Network (PGRN) group to address pharmacogenetic questions related to nicotine addiction, an essential element of tobacco dependence, and treatment. The proposed Pharmacogenetics of Nicotine Addiction and Treatment (PNAT) program, consisting of Clinical, Genetics, Statistics, and Bioinformatics Cores, will conduct a series of multidisciplinary studies to investigate the genetic basis for both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of nicotine as a drug of abuse, as well as individual variation in response to nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion as treatments for tobacco dependence. We also plan to carry out exploratory studies on varenicline and rimonabant, two novel smoking cessation medications currently under clinical development. The PNAT program has five goals: (1) To assess the independent and synergistic roles of candidate genes in nicotine metabolism, dependence and treatment outcome(s) by conducting genetic association analyses involving 5,061 participants in existing and prospectively recruited clinical populations. We will characterize both individual polymorphisms and haplotypes in the candidate genes, as well as gene-gene interactions. (2) To characterize the functional role of significantly associated genetic polymorphisms at molecular, cellular and animal model levels. (3) To clinically validate functionally significant genetic polymorphisms by conducting prospective genotype-stratified pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. (4) To comprehensively evaluate the interaction of genetic factors and pharmacological interventions via pathway-based Bayesian hierarchical modeling. In addition to identification of population-level risk factors, we aim to ultimately use these models for the prediction of individual outcomes so as to design tailored pharmacological interventions within a smoking cessation treatment program. (5) To contribute informative pharmacogenetic data to the PharmGKB database and to create a shared research resource both for use by other members of the PGRN and by those in the communities focused on the understanding of tobacco dependence and, more broadly, drug addiction. The proposed research will lead to increased understanding of the genetic bases for nicotine addiction and genetic influences on responses to pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation. The long-term objective of this work is to better individualize treatment for tobacco dependence, to facilitate the development of novel medications, and to reduce the impact of smoking as a major health problem.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Molecular Libraries Screening Center Network (MSLCN) has been created by the NIH to serve as national resource with the following objectives: (1) To provide High Throughput Screening (HTS) capability to the problem of identifying small organic molecules (lead compounds) that are active in biological assays, (2) To apply the tools of synthetic chemistry to these leads in order to improve their utility as probes for studying biological systems both in vitro and in vivo, and (3) To make the compounds and associated information available to the public and private sectors as research tools, the information being accessible in a database to be known as PubChem. A strategic focus of the project is implementing HTS-based assays for classes of proteins within different gene families. To this end, we propose the following: I. To establish in accordance with the directives detailed in the MLSCN RFA-RM-04-017, a Duke University Molecular Libraries Screening Center (DMLSC) as an integral satellite member of the MLSCN. Our primary areas of focus would lie with the gene families represented by the orphan and identified Seven Transmembrane/G protein coupled receptors (7TM/GPCR) and their corresponding regulatory proteins. We would use for our primary HTS a high content imaging technology invented and patented by Duke Scientists. Within this thematic structure we have the following aims: (a) To develop the capability by the third quarter of Year 1 to process 10,000 compounds per week enabling a throughput of 10 or more assays per year by the end of the fourth quarter, (b)To have the capability by the end of the first quarter of Year 2 of the project to process 100,000 compounds per assay in two weeks, (c) To have the capability by the end of the first quarter of Year 3 of the project to process 100,000 compounds for separate assays every 2-2.5 weeks and (d) To develop the complementary capability to upload the associated assay data, including information describing lead compounds, to PubChem in a timely manner consistent with NIH guidelines. By accomplishing these aims a Duke screening Center will exceed the NIH assay throughput goal of screening 100,000 compounds in 20 separate assays per year and the associated goal of making compounds and information available to the public and private sectors as research tools.

       " 'The overall objective of this project is to further the value of the mouse as a powerful and important tool in the study of human disease through the establishment of a publicly available, comprehensive collection of a fully C57BU6-based null resource knockout embryonic stem cell lines, from which ajibrary of mice containing a null mutation in every gene in the mouse genome can be developed. This application proposes to establish an international consortium of academic institutions comprised of four Canadian (Drs. Naqy. Hicks. Ding and Rancourt). one German (Dr. Wurst) laboratories and the University of Missouri Comparative Medicine Center (Dr. Critser). This consortium was developed to address the NIH RFA (RFA-HG-05-007)for the production of a comprehensive resource of mouse mutants in which every gene in the mouse genome has been knocked out by a null mutation marked with a reporter system of high utility. This consortium fulfills the criteria for an ideal resource in that all of the mutations will be carried on a uniform background strain, C57BL/6, which is the strain most widely utilized by mouse researchers. The unique aspect of this overall proposal is that one laboratory in the consortium (Dr. Nagy\\'s laboratory) has established an exceptional C57BL/6 embryonic stem cell line with a very high germline transmission (-70%). Importantly, this consortium has members which are also part of a Canadian funded project (NORCOMM; Nagy, Hicks, Ding and Rancourt labs) and a European Union funded project (EUCOMM; Wurst lab) to perform high throughput gene mutations in embryonic stems cells. Combining the existing experience and expertise of three major laboratories making null mutations, in combination with the Nagy lab\\'s high germline efficient C57BL/6 embryonic stem cell line and the University of Missouri\\'s expertise in creation of mice and operation of quality control/assurance programs for large NIH-funded resources; will provide a highly efficient and cost effective \\'learn\" to achieve the goals of this RFA. While several consortium members are involved with similar world-wide efforts to provide a complete library of mouse null imitations, there is no overlap between those projects and this KOMP initiative. In fact, a major strength of this proposal is the vast experience and existing infrastructure in those laboratories. The existing high throughput, low cost methods that are \"up and running\" in our collective laboratories enable this consortium to accomplish the goals of the KOMP an extremely timely and cost efficient manner. Importantly, because this consortium is comprised of academic groups, in which there are multiple, separately funded, ongoing research projects directly related to the KOMP, we will be able to ensure continuous access to, and application of, the most cutting-edge technologies and science; thereby providing continuous quality improvement over the course of this KOMP. This aspect will ensure the most cost effective methods are applied at each step along the way to completing the core goals of the KOMP.',\n",

However, our progress in the understanding of how exposures to addictive substances and psychosocial stress interact with genetic factors in the etiology of prevalent human diseases is hindered by the lack of technology to collect precise, accurate and objective data to measure personal exposure to both addictive substances and to psychosocial stress, in real time and in an individual's natural environment. In this trans-disciplinary research project, we propose to develop and validate a new field-deployable tool called AutoSense, to measure personal exposure to alcohol and psychosocial stress by leveraging recent developments in wireless sensor network technology, and innovative approaches in the use of wearable sensors for the non-invasive, real-time, and continuous biochemical assessment of human interstitial fluid. AutoSense will be based on a highly versatile, portable, affordable, and de-facto wireless sensor network platform with a microprocessor and wireless transceiver, called Mote, which is already being used in several embedded sensing applications, including ambulatory patient monitoring. There are three specific aims of this project. First, we propose to integrate an existing ISF alcohol sensor in AutoSense. This sensor developed by SpectRx Inc. non-invasively collects ISF samples to detect levels of alcohol present in a subject's body and automatically calibrates to discern changes in blood alcohol levels. We will also integrate several other existing physiological sensors on the Mote to assess physiological responses related to stress, including skin temperature, skin conductance, respiration rate, and heart rate. Second, we will develop new software to collect and process physiological data on alcohol and stress exposure, to securely transmit the collected data via wireless channel on a real-time basis, and to command, control, and update field deployed AutoSense devices remotely. Third, we will conduct rigorous lab and field studies to validate the AutoSense device. The goals of the lab study will be to establish the validity of using the ISF-based alcohol sensor and other physiological sensors as measures of biochemical responses to alcohol exposure and stress. The goals of the field study will be to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of field deployment. Relevance: The AutoSense device will enable researchers to quantify personal exposure to addictive substances and psychosocial stress, as experienced by individuals in real-life situations. Such a capability will advance our understanding of how exposures to addictive substances and psychosocial stress interact with genetic factors in the etiology of prevalent human diseases of tremendous public health burden.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our transdisciplinary application responds directly to the objectives of RFA-DA-07-005 (U01) by proposing the refinement, field validation and technical expansion of a prototype biosensor to facilitate rapid and precise measurement of salivary biomarkers of exposure to systemic and psychosocial stressors. Our extant hand-held biosensor utilizes a miniaturized optical platform and inexpensive, colorimetric test strips to rapidly detect and quantify salivary alpha-amylase (SAA), a primary bioindicator of the body's adrenergic stress response. Unlike elaborate, laboratory-based assays that frequently involve invasive sampling and provide static measurements, the instantaneous salivary biosensor allows a temporal and spatial resolution conducive to large-scale population studies of stress-health outcome interactions. We will first optimize the technical performance characteristics of the biosensor in a cohort of 50 healthy controls by a) establishing calibration curves for the portable SAA biosensor and comparing it to laboratory assayed SAA, b) examining biosensor reliability (precision and accuracy) over the diurnal cycle, and c) demonstrating its validity as a exposure assessment tool under conditions of low and high stress. Subsequently we will conduct small-scale field testing and functional validation of the biosensor in a cohort of 185 vulnerable patients with high systemic (facial injury) and psychosocial stress. We will a) test collection procedures and validity of the SAA biosensor across variations in systemic and psychosocial stress (hospital intake, 10 days post-surgery, 30-day post surgery), b) examine potential confounding effects of predisposing vulnerabilities (e.g., sociodemographics, stress burden, social support) and systemic milieu (e.g., substance use, health/lifestyle behaviors) on biomarker levels, and c) assess the predictive validity of biosensor SAA for maladaptive psychological (e.g., distress, anxiety, depression) and behavioral symptoms (e.g., increased substance use) following injury. Concurrently, we will refine the technical capabilities of the biosensor platform and expand its capabilities to permit multiplexed assays of other salivary analytes reflective of the stress response (e.g., cortisol, DHEA, testosterone) as well as licit and illicit substance use. Our ultimate goal is to develop a universal, portable platform to operationalize the psychobiology of stress and substance use by detecting and reliably quantifying relevant salivary response indicators. The synergistic combination of complementary research expertise and the body of precursor research devoted to psychosocial stress and its biomarkers maximize the likelihood that our research program will produce a field-deployable biosensor of the stress response by the end of the funding period.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accumulating evidence is consistent with the possibility that psychosocial stress may moderate the effects of genetic factors on health and behavioral outcomes. Further advances in this area are predicated on the development of standardized, psychometrically sound instruments for quantifying exposures to psychosocial stress. Over the past several years, our research team has pioneered several state-of-the-art strategies for the assessment of psychosocial stress, including a new structured retrospective interview approach designed to quantify historical exposure to chronic stressors in human populations, and a real-time ecological momentary assessment (EMA) method designed to capture current psychological and physiological markers of mental stress as they emerge over the course of daily living. Building upon our ongoing experience and expertise, the goal of the current project is to translate each of these two assessment approaches into standardized field-deployable technologies that can be employed across multiple sites and populations. The current project is organized around a series of incremental studies that are designed to help us meet the following milestones: a) to develop efficient electronic data collection devices for administering, recording, and scoring self-report assessments relevant to each of these two novel assessment approaches, b) to refine the item content associated with each of these two data collection devices in a manner that will enhance validity, reliability, and item discrimination of the associated measures, c) to examine the reliability of the resulting instruments in a population representative sample and to determine optimal conditions of testing, and d) to document training and testing procedures associated with these methods, and to examine the feasibility of a pursuing the development of relevant production quality > devices for use in large scale research projects. The current proposal is a response to the RFA on \"Field- deployable Tools for Quantifying Exposures to Psychosocial Stress and to Addictive Substances for Studies : of Health and Disease (U01) (RFA-DA-07-005).\" Category 1 submission.

Integrated into the envisioned system will be two-way communication capabilities so that real-time light and activity data can be acquired by remote computer for immediate processing and then for generation of a light (and dark) exposure recommendation for any desired circadian phase entrainment desired by the young adult. Commonly adolescents and young adults experience age-dependent delayed sleep phase with respect to socially acceptable activity/rest periods. This lack of entrainment to socially acceptable activity/rest periods can lead to reduced sleep duration and efficiency which in turn can lead to a number of symptoms of psychosocial stress. A personal device that can accurately measure light/dark exposures as well as periods of activity/rest is envisioned for correcting circadian entrainment problems in young adults. A regression model for predicting circadian entrainment from light and activity data will be developed based upon a controlled light intervention study. To augment the model, changes in gene expression following the controlled light intervention will be assessed as well as changes in gene expression following the controlled light intervention. Based upon the regression model and the personal light and activity data, it will be possible to prescribe specific times and amounts of light (and dark) for a person to experience such that she/he can entrain to any desired circadian phase.

Assessment of their causal connections with one another, and of their genetic and environmental determinants, is complicated by the complexity of the causal connections and by the elusive nature of what constitutes the \"environment.\" In the proposed study, we will assess drug use and psychosocial stress in near-real time through Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), in which participants use handheld electronic diaries to record events as they occur and to report recent or ongoing events in response to randomly timed prompts throughout the day. We will also maintain real-time records of where the reported events occurred by having participants carry Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to track their whereabouts with a likely spatial resolution of several meters. Broadening the definition of environmental factors, we will evaluate \\'neighborhood-level\\' exposures to drugs and stress measured in terms of specially developed indices, the Drug Environment Index (DEI) and the Neighborhood Psychosocial Hazards index (NPH), each based on objective statistical data available from public sources and independent of self-report. For comparison, drug use exposure will also be assessed through retrospective audio-computer assisted structure interview (ACASI) and from biological specimens (hair and sweat), and stress will be assessed through ACASI and physiological measures (heart rate and allostatic load). The project represents a collaboration between the NIDA Intramural Research Program (where EMA is already in use with polydrug-dependent outpatients) and Johns Hopkins ALIVE Study investigators (following a well- characterized community cohort of drug abusers, most of who are not in treatment). Following developmental work at NIDA linked to field trials in ALIVE, the result is expected to be a set of field- deployable, state-of-the-art tools indispensable to future studies of gene-environment interactions affecting drug use and stress.

To address this need, these preclinical studies will facilitate the medical discovery and development of new (+)METH- conjugate vaccines (MCVs) to help patients stop using (+)METH-like drugs. These important new MCVs are expected to block or reduce (+)METH effects in patients. The discovery of medically effective MCVs will be accomplished through our well-integrated, multidisciplinary research program designed to manufacture and test MCVs. In previous preclinical studies, our group showed that 1) titer and affinity of antibodies generated against MCV are not adversely affected by continuous (+)METH use, 2) a single MCV might be used to generate high-affinity antibodies against (+)METH and (+)-amphetamine ((+)AMP), and 3) anti-(+)METH monoclonal antibodies generated from a novel MCV can be used to reduce brain (+)METH concentrations and reduce (+)METH or (+)AMP self-administration. These accomplishments substantially enhanced our scientific vision, clearly defined the project's research aims, and identified a premier MCV candidate for the for use in active immunization. Our ultimate goal is to have one or more safe, effective MCV in a human- compatible formulation ready for clinical trials within five years. To accomplish this, we have four aims. In Aim 1, we will design, synthesize, and manufacture innovative new MCVs and carefully optimize the immunological conditions needed to achieve the best combination of antibody titer, affinity, specificity of response, and duration of action (i.e., therapeutic effectiveness). In Aim 2, we will test the best of these MCVs in pharmacokinetic and behavioral studies designed to select MCVs that decrease penetration of (+)METH into the brain and reduce or block drug self-administration without adversely influencing withdrawal effects. In Aim 3, safety will be determined by monitoring general animal health, measuring blood chemistries, and examining animal tissues during and after chronic vaccination. In Aim 4, a data monitoring program based on data sets collected in Aims 1-3 will be developed and enacted with industry partner InterveXion Therapeutics to maximize the potential for expedient FDA approval. The decision to take an MCV candidate to the FDA will be made in collaboration with external advisors and NIDA, then our ongoing programmatic approach will facilitate rapid transition through clinical testing, including IND application. Achieving our goal will address the major public health problem of (+)METH dependence by blocking or reducing its effects even under challenges of binge and relapse.

Our focus is on children assessed repeatedly, beginning in pre-adolescence at age 11 and then again at approximately ages 14, 17, 20, 24, and 29, making it possible to examine the development of individual differences within narrowly defined age ranges that correspond roughly to key life transitions associated with important changes in environmental context (starting high school, leaving the parental home, exposure to new peers, etc). Our studies involve representative, community based samples with high participation rates, and thorough age appropriate, psychometrically sound assessments covering 1) substance use, misuse, and dependence; 2) disorders, personality traits, and behaviors related to behavioral disinhibition; 3) psychophysiogical endophenotypes for SA risk; and 4) environmental adversity derived from multiple domains (family relationships, trauma, peer group quality, exposure to substances, etc.) over multiple developmental stages.

We will obtain consent to participate in this GEDI initiative from an additional 2300 individuals whose data will already be part of the NGC. We will carry out a 2-stage genome wide association study using a 1M SNP bead array with 1000 parents followed by confirmation genotyping with an additional 2700 parents using three SA related latent phenotypes focused on a) SA risk, b) behavioral disinhibition attributes, and c) brain electrophysiology (event related potentials and oscillations). These three quantitative phenotypes will be developed and refined early in the funding period so as to capture complementary aspects of genetic risk for SA similarly in parents and young adult offspring. Offspring (N=3582) will then be genotyped using candidate genes identified in the parent study as well as in the evolving SA literature. A composite measure of environmental adversity will also be developed and used in hypothesis driven tests of GxE effects in offspring that include examination of the developmental specificity of effects and their replicability across related measures, developmental time points, and offspring samples. Also included will be hypothesis-generating exploratory analyses that take advantage of the richness of the phenotypic data available from our families and the rapid pace of development in molecular biology and statistical genetics.

Our focus is on children assessed repeatedly, beginning in pre-adolescence at age 11 and then again at approximately ages 14, 17, 20, 24, and 29, making it possible to examine the development of individual differences within narrowly defined age ranges that correspond roughly to key life transitions associated with important changes in environmental context (starting high school, leaving the parental home, exposure to new peers, etc). Our studies involve representative, community based samples with high participation rates, and thorough age appropriate, psychometrically sound assessments covering 1) substance use, misuse, and dependence;2) disorders, personality traits, and behaviors related to behavioral disinhibition;3) psychophysiogical endophenotypes for SA risk;and 4) environmental adversity derived from multiple domains (family relationships, trauma, peer group quality, exposure to substances, etc.) over multiple developmental stages. We propose obtaining blood-based DMA from approximately 5000 study participants which, along with deidentified personal data, will be added to the NIDA Genetics Consortium (NGC) public repository.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of studies to provide clarity in three areas associated with organizational change and innovation implementation that have heretofore, not well researched within criminal justice or substance abuse treatment settings. The role of organizational and clinical feedback has long been posited as both a stimulating variable for enhancing individual and organizational readiness to change as well as a mediating variable for the efficiency and effectiveness of implementation change processes. Critical questions remain, however, regarding the relative influence of the content, timeliness, context, and format of such information on stimulating and sustaining individual and organizational implementation change. The role of organizational and individual social networks has been well documented within innovation adoption and organizational changes processes but not addressed to date with regard to the implementation of evidence based criminal justice or substance abuse treatment. Previous research has well documented the important and complimentary roles that weak social ties and strong social ties among organizations and among individuals play in innovation exposure and innovation implementation. The paucity of research regarding social networks within the substance abuse and criminal justice systems is unfortunate, given the dynamic and transient nature of service access and provision that typifies most substance using offenders. The final area of research that we propose will focus upon the measurement of implementation as an organizational outcome in its own right. To date, implementation has been narrowly conceived as treatment fidelity, assessed primarily through measures of individual clinician behavior and/or treatment unit indices of fidelity. Such treatment-bounded approaches to the definition and measurement of implementation impede the study of implementation as a organizational or personalogical phenomenon wherein the mediating characteristics of the treatment approach (e.g., complexity, trialability, etc.) are assessed. This project, under the direction of co-Principal Investigators Michael S. Shafer and Barbara Broderick, represents a collaborative network, anchored at Arizona State University bringing together the expertise of the Center for Applied Behavioral Health Policy and the Decision Support Theater, in concert with a network of adult and juvenile probation departments, affiliated community based treatment providers and juvenile corrections.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-density microarrays and next-generation sequencing technologies, coupled with the availability of the annotated human genomic sequence, are opening a road toward a comprehensive mapping of molecular epigenetic patterns. It is anticipated that comprehensive mapping and study of epigenetic patterns both \"horizontally\" along the genomic sequence and \"vertically\" across multiple differentiation and developmental stages and physiological conditions, will provide insights into human development, physiology, and disease. This vision of epigenomics calls both for novel organizational models suitable for high-throughput data-driven science and for innovative networked cyberinfrastructure. This project aims to develop such networked cyberinfrastructure and employ it to integrate and coordinate data analyses and data pipelines involving designated Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers (REMCs), NCBI, and other participants. The infrastructure builds on the now well established Genboree system which was developed in the context of numerous genome projects and has most recently been employed to coordinate the pilot stage of The Cancer Genome Atlas Project. The infrastructure will provide both scalability for further integration of new epigenomic technologies with increasing data production throughputs and adaptability to accommodate an increasing diversity of experimental and computational methodologies. Using the software-as-a-service model, web services, and semantic web technologies, the infrastructure will help integrate and coordinate efforts of REMCs, NCBI, and an increasing number of collaborating institutions and multi-disciplinary groups in the field of epigenomics working across geographic locations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epigenomics is the study of heritable or stable changes in human cells that are not coded in the genomic DNA. The role of epigenomic changes in diseases as diverse as obesity, autism, and cancer is coming to light. Importantly, because epigenomic phenomena are affected by nutrition and environment, including maternal nutrition during pregnancy, increased understanding of epigenomics may lead to better health through changes in human nutrition and behavior. To better understand epigenomic phenomena in human health and disease, the NIH Roadmap Initiative in Epigenomics proposes comprehensive mapping and study of epigenomic patterns in human tissues at different developmental stages and physiological conditions. High-density microarrays and next-generation sequencing technologies, coupled with the availability of the annotated human genomic sequence, are opening a road toward a comprehensive mapping of such patterns. The amount and diversity of data produced will be very large and will require an informatic infrastructure for proper analysis. Building on the established Genboree system for collaborative genomic research over the Internet, this project aims to develop such a networked infrastructure, and employ it to integrate and to coordinate data analyses and data pipelines involving designated Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers and other participants in the NIH Roadmap Initiative in Epigenomics.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of two different treatments for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). SSNHL is an otologic emergency causing unilateral deafness of variable severity. If treated promptly with a short course of oral corticosteroids, approximately 60% of patients regain some hearing. However, in patients with severe-to-profound SSNHL it is rare to fully recover hearing. Increasing duration of oral steroid therapy beyond three to four weeks has never been shown to improve hearing outcome, and the risk of steroid side effects rises with greater duration of treatment. Recent animal studies of corticosteroid penetrance into the inner ear and reports of treatment outcome in several small uncontrolled series of SSNHL patients suggest that local administration of corticosteroids by intratympanic (IT) injection may achieve equivalent or better hearing recovery while lowering the potential risk of systemic side effects. In this project we propose a multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of oral prednisone vs. IT methylprednisolone for primary treatment of SSNHL. All qualified subjects will be randomized to receive either two weeks or oral prednisone or two weeks of IT methylprednisolone injections. The two Specific Aims of the study are to: (1) test the primary hypothesis that IT corticosteroids are as effective as oral prednisone for primary SSNHL treatment; and (2) compare the side-effects and adverse events in subjects treated with oral or IT steroids. The project is designed as an equivalency study. If the primary hypothesis of equivalency is supported, results of the second Specific Aim, comparison of side-effects, will guide clinical practice. If the two treatments are not equivalent, the study design enables us to detect which is better and by how much. Thus the results of this study will have significant impact on evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for management of SSNHL. This application is for the collaborating Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC).',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a potentially life threatening disease caused by human papillomaviruses (HPVs). The disease is characterized by repeated growth of benign tumors, predominantly in the larynx but sometimes extending into the trachea and lungs. In the larynx, the papillomas impair the voice and cause airway obstruction. In the lungs, they are frequently fatal. There is no effective, safe medical treatment. Conventional treatment is surgical removal, but surgery does not prevent recurrence of disease, which is believed to be due to activation of latent HPV infection. Current experimental treatments only help a subset of patients, and those with pulmonary disease usually do not respond. The goal of this application is to test the hypothesis that treatment with celecoxib, an inhibitor of the inducible enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), will prevent or reduce recurrent disease when used as an adjunct to surgery. The application is based on our preliminary studies of elevated levels of COX-2 and the prostaglandins it produces in papillomas, in vitro results supporting a role for COX-2 in the pathophysiology of RRP, studies by other showing anti-tumor properties of celecoxib in other diseases, including HPV-induced disease, and preliminary clinical data treating patients with RRP. The study is a Phase II randomized double blind placebo controlled multi-center clinical trial to assess the efficacy of celecoxib therapy for RRP. Patients ages 18 or older with moderate to severe disease will be eligible for enrollment. After a 6 month evaluation period to define rate of papilloma growth, patients randomized to an early treatment arm with 12 months of celecoxib therapy followed by 12 months on placebo, or a delayed treatment arm receiving placebo for 12 months followed by 12 months on celecoxib. All patients will be in the study for 2.5 years. Aim 1, the primary aim of the study is to determine efficacy of celecoxib treatment and whether response is sustained when celecoxib is stopped. Aim 2 will correlate possible variation in response with select clinical and demographic characteristics. Aims 3-4 will address possible mechanism of action, determining whether molecular markers are consistent with celecoxib is acting through a COX-2 dependent or independent mechanism (Aim 3), and whether celecoxib therapy reduces persistence of latent HPV DMA (Aim 4). Together, these aims will determine whether celecoxib therapy is effective in treating respiratory papillomas, determine which patients will respond, and increase our understanding of the effects of celecoxib on this disease.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a significant clinical, social, and economic issue; resolving this important health issue is central to the mission of the NIDCD. Our long-term strategic program of \"bedside to laboratory bench to bedside\" directly leads to the current proposal to translate an intervention from \"bench to bedside\". Ten years of NIDCD funding for studies in animals have allowed us to identify mechanisms contributing to NIHL, including direct mechanical trauma, free radicals formed in association with metabolic stress, and reduced blood flow. We have now identified a combination of micronutrients (antioxidants and other agents) as highly effective in preventing NIHL in animals. This treatment significantly attenuates sensory cell death in the inner ear and corresponding threshold deficits. The proposed studies, conducted by an international team including basic scientists, otolaryngologists, and audiologists, will demonstrate efficacy of this therapeutic intervention in humans during carefully-controlled clinical trials with real-world noise insults. Specific Aim 1 will verify therapeutic efficacy with real-world noise insults that induce temporary threshold shifts; these studies will focus on loud music under laboratory conditions, and military urban warfare training exercises. Specific Aim 2 will verify therapeutic efficacy in humans exposed to occupational noise on a daily basis, including aircraft noise experienced by pilots and ground crew, and machine noise experienced by cutlery workers. Availability of an effective treatment will reduce development of hearing loss in at-risk human populations, thereby improving quality of life for millions and decreasing healthcare costs for individuals, businesses, and government agencies. Funds are therefore requested to initiate a series of Phase II clinical trials to demonstrate for the first time the effectiveness of this intervention in man. This program is intended to be the first translational research step to eliminate NIHL in the 21st century. Noise-induced hearing loss is an important medical, social, and economic issue. We have identified a treatment that reduces inner ear cell death and hearing loss in animals. These studies will demonstrate efficacy of this treatment in humans. This prevention will improve quality of life for the millions exposed to noise, and decrease healthcare costs for individuals, businesses, and government agencies.

Many patients still receive inadequate care, however, related to incomplete or incorrect diagnostic testing, inadequate management strategies, or lack of access to facilities with multi-disciplinary expertise. The Duke Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center, one of the founding centers in the Thrombophilia Pilot Program supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), integrates areas of clinical expertise to provide coordinated care for patients with thrombotic and hemorrhagic disorders. The Center maintains a patient registry, provides access to clinical research  [unreadable] protocols, emphasizes patient education, and has developed a training program for providers interested in disorders of hemostasis. The primary objective of this proposal is to enhance development of the Duke program as a participating institution with the CDC and other Centers in the Thrombosis and Hemostasis Research and Prevention Network. We propose to accomplish this through the following Aims: (1) Establish the Duke Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center as an integral member of the CDC-sponsored Research and Prevention Network to collaboratively develop research, educational objectives, and establish diagnostic and therapeutic standards for patients with complex hemorrhagic and thromboembolic disorders; (2) Enhance patient care by developing evaluation tools that measure clinical outcomes, quality of life and patient satisfaction, improving patient understanding of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic disorders, and expanding the delivery of care to underserved populations across the Network; (3) Develop and implement a research agenda through the Network to address unanswered epidemiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic questions; and (4) Promote training programs that foster the development of independent researchers and expert clinicians and other providers in thrombosis and hemostasis.We propose to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to continue our participation in the development of a network of Thrombosis and Hemostasis Centers. These Centers will provide multidisciplinary expertise for patients with complex clotting and bleeding problems, improving the care that we can deliver to these patients.

Using this same model of care with specialists in multiple disciplines, services to the thrombophilia and thrombosis population as well as women with bleeding began in 2001. During the first phase of funding, the infrastructure of the women's and thrombosis clinics was established with both the adult and pediatric populations. Services include diagnosis, in- and out-patient care, follow-up care, education, family outreach for diagnosis and education, community education and interaction with the patient advocacy group. This cooperative agreement will enable the program to continue to grow, develop more educational materials, expand our research efforts and provide a model for coordinated hemophilia and thrombophilia clinics nationally. The goals of this project are: 1) determine the efficacy of integrated interdisciplinary care and prevention services for persons with hemophilia, other hereditary bleeding disorders including women with bleeding disorders, and thrombophilia to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with bleeding and clotting diseases; 2) assess unmet needs for service delivery and identify outreach strategies designed to improve access to care; 3) develop effective messages aimed at disease management and prevention; and 4) foster the development of training programs to enhance provider skills for the delivery of hemostasis and thrombosis care.

The primary objective ofthis proposal is to translate a promising scientifically evaluated intervention, Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) for children with FASD, to community settings. PCIT is designed to reduce behavior problems common in this population as well as to reduce parenting stress. The specific aim of the project is to disseminate PCIT to four community mental health settings, including one tribal setting in an effort to bridge the transition between research-based development of interventions and community implementation of these interventions. Following a community service assessment to ensure stakeholder and partner involvement and outline ways to increase recruitment and retention, the training of the intervention therapists will begin. Specifically,the intervention will be PCIT, a 14-week (on average) intervention, coupled with FASDeducation, designed to increase caregiver understanding of the problem, and MotivationalEnhancement,designed to increase retention of families involved in the intervention program. Although PCITis an empirically based treatment, little is known about the uptake of the model in community settings and the intensity of supervision necessary for fidelity to the model as well as successful outcome for the familiesenrolled. Therefore, not only will this project seek to implement PCITwith children with FASD into community settings, but it will also endeavor to evaluate which of three approaches to training will result in the most effective and cost-efficient outcome. Ongoing feedback from community sites as well as from community partners will allow for necessary adaptations. A model for training trainers for further dissemination as well as plans for sustainability will also be incorporated into the proposed project. FASD with its resulting problems is a significant public health issue with the Institute of Medicine (1996) citing alcohol use during pregnancy as producing the most serious effect in the brain of the developing fetus of all substances of abuse. Bydesigning and implementing a community-based approach to FASD,both the community and the families directly impacted can benefit.\",\n",

For parents raising children with FASDwho show earjy, serious challenging behavior (and signs of family/school disruption), efficacious intervention is crucial. To meet family needs, a new behavioral consultation intervention (called . Families Moving Forward(FMF)) was developed andtested, with promising initial efficacy findings. The next phase in programmatic research involvestransitioning the FMF intervention to the community in order to assessfeasibility and effectiveness. The University of Washington FAS Diagnostic & Prevention Network (FAS DPN), Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center (CHRMC) and a community family services and training agency, called the Institute for Family Development(IFD), will work together to implement and assess a community-based FMF intervention. FMFintervention will be provided to 30 families of children with FASD.

To increase the availability of such services, the current application proposes to translate the results of a clinical trial of a method for socio-cognitive habitationto community settings. Two components of this protocol were found to be efficacious in the initial trials and will be evaluated independently for effectiveness in the broader community setting.

We will enroll 40 children from Central Illinois who are in the child welfare system and who have a diagnosis of FAS or ARND. All children and their families enrolled in the program will receive therapeutic interventions at the Central Illinois Behavioral Health Clinic. These interventions will be a replication of the neurocognitive habilitation and parent psychoeducation program developed at Children's Research Triangle. Families enrolled in the program, as compared to families in the original control group, will show: higher rates of entry into prevention and treatment services, higher rates of return visits for follow up, a longer period of retention in prevention and treatment services, higher rates of utilization of tertiary community services, a greater satisfaction with services, higher levels of perception of parenting competency, decreased levels of parenting stress, and increased levels of positive feelings toward the child. Children enrolled in the program will demonstrate higher levels of cognitive development, neurobehavioral control and school performance with lower levels of secondary conditions.

In a number of studies, prenatally exposed children have been shown to have poor social skills such as failure to consider the consequences of their actions, difficulty understanding social cues, indiscriminant social behavior, and difficulty communicating in social contexts. The developmentof adequate social skills is important because the child with poor skills acquires a negative reputation among peers concomitant with social rejection and a higher probability of engaging in delinquent acts. In recognitionof the importance of early social skill development for children with prenatal alcohol exposure, Project Bruin Buddies (CDC/U84-CCU920158) was initiated using an empirically derived parent assisted social skills training approach. Results of the randomized controlled study were that children in the treatment group showed a significant improvement in the quality of their play with other children, a greater knowledge regarding appropriate social behaviors, improved overall social skills, and a reduction in problem behaviors compared to the control group. Furthermore, they continued to show improvement at 3-month follow up. Given the success of this intervention program, we now propose to introduce it to a local mental health agency and to work with that agency to determine how best to adapt and implement the intervention in the community. In this way,we hope to bridge the transitionbetween university based research and community implementation.

Stage II - Interventions -Develop and implement a detailed intervention programme and monitoring plan based on the findings of Stage I, to include interventions that are specific to the individual, the group, and the general community level. Stage III - Evaluation- Evaluate each of the components of the intervention programme, and assess the extent to which they could be sustained on a larger scale, in an integrated model.

The sites: an urban area of Pretoria in the Tshwane Municipality, and a rural farming area of the Western Cape. A KAP survey (750 households), services audit, FAS family case studies, and mapping of liquor outlets will provide information onwhich to create a conceptual framework and to base a multi-level intervention programme aiming to reduce risky drinking and promote family planning, especially by childbearing age women. The interventions will be executed in collaboration with existing services, using a health promotion approach. A randomized controlled trial will be used to assess the efficacy of augmented counseling over regular counseling. The support groups and community awareness campaign will assess to what extent the interventions have shifted the local awareness regarding the planning of pregnancy and the levels of risky drinking.  Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and other alcohol related birth defects have been found to be at high levels in some rural and urban areas in South Africa, and there is a generally high level of risky drinking across all population groups of women in childbearing age. The health and social services are overwhelmed with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and to date no prevention study has been done to investigate appropriate and sustainable strategies to prevent women of childbearing age from drinking in pregnancy, and to enable them to better plan their pregnancies.',\n",

The overall objectives are: 1) to conduct active, population-based surveillance of Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DBMD) to characterize the epidemiology of DBMD and its complications and 2) to develop long-term follow-up and tracking of children with DBMD to describe the history and outcome of treated cases and/or those cases with treatments not consistent with protocol standards. The hypothesis guiding this research is that population-based surveillance and integrated research programs are effective in determining the prevalence of DMD/BMD disorders and establishing data on health outcomes and the types of care for these disorders. Research has shown that population-based surveillance for individual disorders is an effective first step to clinical and descriptive studies. Surveillance provides population data as a basis for making comparisons to the samples of individuals with these disorders that respond to questionnaires or clinical studies. The alternative of volunteer-based research in clinic-based populations may produce data that do not reflect the population of individuals with the disorder. For the current project, the Arizona Muscular Dystrophy Research and Surveillance Program (Arizona MD STARnet) proposes to continue as a participating MD STARnet site with the following specific aims: 1. Generate population-based prevalence and incidence rates for DBMD in the United States with particular attention to differences in rates over time and by race/ethnicity; 2. Identify the early signs and symptoms of DBMD; 3. Describe the medical and social services received and quality of life of families of patients with DBMD and whether these vary by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status; and 4. Investigate whether the severity or course of DBMD is influenced by variation in type of care received and by type of mutation identified.

Due to the large size of this gene, there is a high new mutation rate making eradication of DBMD unlikely. Comprehensive, population-based surveillance along with long-term follow-up of individuals with DBMD is needed to characterize the occurrence of this disorder and its complications and to evaluate methods of delivery of health care, specific medical and surgical interventions and psychosocial impact for affected individuals and their families. In 2002, the Iowa Registry for Congenital and Inherited Disorders (IRCID) was one of four charter awardees for the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking and Research Network (MD STARnet). As an MD STARnet site, we successfully integrated clinical, programmatic and referral resources provided by relevant stakeholders in Iowa with the resources of the IRCID to establish a statewide infrastructure for DBMD surveillance and to implement long-term follow-up of individuals with DBMD and their families. We also conducted a needs assessment among Iowa families to better understand the impact DBMD has on individuals and their families and to identify gaps in resources and barriers to accessing resources. In addition, we established and maintained the MD STARnet Data Coordination Center (DCC) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and participating sites. For the current agreement, we propose to successfully continue as an MD STARnet site and the MD STARnet DCC to: 1) generate population-based prevalence and incidence rates for DBMD in the United States with particular attention to differences in rates over time and by race/ethnicity; 2) identify the early signs and symptoms of DBMD to facilitate early diagnosis; 3) describe the medical and social services received and quality of life of families of patients with DBMD and whether these vary by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status; and 4) investigate factors that may impact the severity or course of DBMD including medical management and genetic and environmental factors. Using this population-based approach, we will gain increased understanding of the epidemiology of this disorder and its complications, which will allow for development of improved guidelines for care for individuals with DBMD.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DBMD) are progressive muscle wasting diseases caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the muscle protein, dystrophin. The incidence of DBMD is commonly given as 1/3500 (0.29 per 1,000) male births and is considered the most common lethal pediatric disorder worldwide. Recent studies of prevalence of DMD and BMD in the United States are lacking. The primary objectives of our long-term surveillance project are: 1) to ascertain cases of Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DBMD) in a defined region of the State to generate population-based data on DBMD; 2) to collect information on types of care and care settings for persons with DBMD and evaluate whether care received influences severity or course of DBMD and/or whether it satisfies family needs based on family reports and quality of life measures; 3) to collect information on early signs and symptoms as well as types and prevalence of complications; 4) to conduct additional DNA tests and evaluate whether the severity or course of DBMD can be predicted by the type of mutation (e.g., genotype-phenotype correlation); and 5) to assess whether race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES) or other demographic variables correlate with types of care patients and families receive. Common protocols and tools will be used that were developed by the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance Tracking and Research Network (MD STARnet) during the past three years. These include a case definition and surveillance protocols along with software applications for medical record abstraction, clinical review and pooled data. Neuromuscular specialists at each of the five participating sites (Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa and New York) will continue to review pooled data to determine if a case meets case criteria. A multiple source ascertainment methodology has been most efficient and will continue to be used to identify individuals with DBMD. The following types of sources have been used: neuromuscular specialty clinics and diagnostic facilities, the hospital discharge database, community pediatricians and developmental specialists, and death certificates. MD surveillance differs from traditional birth defects surveillance as children will be diagnosed at an older age and usually not hospitalized at the time of diagnosis. RELEVANCE: Determination of the U.S. prevalence of DBMD both currently and over time will help us understand (1) the burden of disease on society and (2) if and how various factors such as genetic counseling and changes in management/treatment of DBMD, particularly prednisone therapy, are influencing prevalence and long-term outcome. The mechanisms and risk factors for these mutations are not well understood, and this study may increase our knowledge here through planned examinations of various demographic and lifestyle exposures, both occupational and environmental.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DBMD) are X-linked disorders presumed to affect 1 in 3,500 male births. These conditions follow a course of progressive muscle weakness leading to death in the late teens to early twenties. As such, the impact of these conditions on medical systems, communities, and families is significant. Through the 'Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research and Education Amendments of 2001', the United States Congress enacted legislation to provide for research with respect to various forms of muscular dystrophy, including DBMD. A part of this Act authorized the creation of a National Muscular Dystrophy Epidemiology Program, in which the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provided for a national surveillance program for DBMD for the purpose of carrying out epidemiological activities, including collecting and analyzing information on the number, incidence, correlates, and symptoms of those individuals with DBMD. To fulfill this mandate, in 2002, the CDC awarded four sites - Arizona, Colorado, Iowa and New York - cooperative agreements to develop a surveillance network, the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance Tracking and Research Network (MD STARnet). MD STARnet sites have been developing and implementing epidemiologic methods that will lead to a better understanding of DBMD over the past four years. For the current project, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment proposes to continue as a participating MD STARnet site to: 1) Generate population-based prevalence and incidence rates for DBMD in the United States with particular attention to differences in rates over time and by race/ethnicity; 2) Identify the early signs and symptoms of DBMD; 3) Describe the medical and social services received and quality of life of families of patients with DBMD and whether these vary by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status; and 4) Investigate whether the severity or course of DBMD is influenced by variation in type of care received and by type of mutation identified. We believe that the accomplishment of the objectives and activities above will be meaningful to both clinicians and families and will help to guide the development of standards of care for muscular dystrophy.

These bleeding disorders result in both spontaneous and trauma-induced bleeding. The purpose of this project is to prevent complications of bleeding disorders through the network of Region hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). Consisting of 15 HTCs in DE, MD, PA, VA, WV, and DC Region III serves 3,061 individuals with bleeding disorders. The principal investigator and significant contributors for this project have extensive experience in caring for individuals with bleeding disorders and are supported by a multi-disciplinary team. Each HTC is a specialty, prevention, diagnostic and treatment program providing assessment, education, research, surveillance, outreach, consultation, and management to children, adolescents, and adults with bleeding disorders. Comprehensive care has been shown to decrease mortality n men with hemophilia. Building on this success and using data through the CDC's Universal Data Collection study, this network is poised to answer key questions related to optimal care and prevention strategies for patients with inherited bleeding disorders. Working collaboratively with the nationwide system of HTCs, the Region III network will foster the understanding of health promotion and prevention of disease, injury and disability by the following Specific Aims: 1) To enhance prevention activities and improve outcomes by: expanding Region III HTC participation in the UDC study and utilizing data collected to address research questions, including: a) Does rural or urban residence impact UDC participation and utilization of HTC resources? b) Do patients with moderate hemophilia have worse joint function than patients with severe disease on primary or modified primary prophylaxis? 2) To maintain the regional network of HTCs to allow data collection and implementation of prevention strategies by: providing comprehensive care to reduce complications from bleeding disorders; developing programs to expand the HTC patient populations, including women and minorities; facilitating training resources for new and established HTC staff; and providing educational resources for other medical providers. 3) To implement DC supported regional activities through the University of Pennsylvania Core Center to collaborate with a national network of Core Centers to implement the objectives of these project activities and studies by: facilitating communication between the HTCs; maintaining a Regional Executive Committee; organizing an annual Regional Meeting; providing oversight to the subcontracting HTCs; serving as a liaison between the DC, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, National Hemophilia Foundation and HTCs; sharing research data throughout the nationwide HTC network; and participating in the CDC Coordinating Committee.

This proposed program will be performed in conjunction with the national network of twelve federally funded regional networks. During the past ten years the regional networks, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), established a national network of treatment centers that have the capacity to serve as prevention centers. Multidisciplinary teams have been trained to implement prevention programs and research. A national database has been developed that collects demographic, clinical and quality of life data. This is the largest clinical database of rare bleeding disorders in the world. The regional program's overall goal for the next five years is in conjunction with the national network design prevention messages, strategies, and clinical trials and share the data with other relevant agencies, such as HRSA, MCHB, NHLBI, NHF and researchers and care providers of individuals. This will be accomplished by: 1) expanding the cohort through continued recruitment and observations of individuals with bleeding disorders including hemophilia A and Hemophilia B, von Willebrand disease, rare bleeding disorders, and women with bleeding disorders: (2) transition from paper submission of data to web-based (3) expand the database to collect data relevant to Woman's issues in coagulation, prophylaxis, inhibitor formation, utilization of treatment products and treatment regimes, obesity, and other important clinical information (4) maintain a regional administration that will support the established infrastructure and foster collaboration, (5) perform regional and national research utilizing the national database and (6) expand the current database to include relevant data on women's issues, obesity issues, rare bleeding disorders, and prophylaxis.

These data sets will include both disease-specific and general-health related information. The data acquired will be used for proactive implementation of prevention programs throughout the network of multidisciplinary comprehensive Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) throughout the United States. HTC's are designed to treat patients with hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand Disease and rare factor deficiencies. Utilizing the comprehensive care model, therapeutic interventions based on previously collected data and changes in therapy based on new research continues to enhance the care of the bleeding disorders community. Chronic genetic disorders often require complex and multidisciplinary care for optimal diagnosis, treatment and management. The consequences of bleeding disorders include severe medical, financial, vocational, psychological and familial repercussions when the condition is not properly managed. The lack of proper treatment has general public health consequences such as increased costs of care caused by increased hospital and emergency utilization and patient disability that may require welfare and other government entitlements. A regional approach to planning, coordination and allocation of funds is vital to ensure that services are available to treat this and other complicated bleeding disorders in Region II, New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The proposed program will continue a national network of federally funded HTCs organized through 12 regional core centers and funded by the CDC. Aim 1: To provide comprehensive prevention services to persons with bleeding disorders directed at attaining and measuring specific outcomes through research and surveillance aimed at reducing complications using a multidisciplinary approach. Under this aim we propose to expand the cohort through continued recruitment and observation individuals with genetic bleeding disorders including hemophilia A and B, von Willebrand disease, rare bleeding disorders and women with bleeding disorders; and expand the current Universal Data and Serum Specimen Collection System (UDC) database to collect additional relevant data related to women's issues in coagulation, rare bleeding disorders, prophylaxis, factor utilization, inhibitors, genetic mutations, and other important clinical outcomes. We plan to design and pilot additional studies aimed at further characterizing the bleeding disorders population through the expanded access to a) gene-based diagnosis and b) more precise definition of the biochemical phenotype (e.g. global assays) with the ultimate goal of genotype - phenotype correlation; utilize the UDC BMI data to evaluate the cost impact on the health care system from conditions with weight-based dosing; test interventions that could facilitate weight loss; and design and pilot a study to evaluate effects of rising annual out- of-pocket expenses and co-payments on the use of elective/preventive services provided by the HTC. Aim 2: Maintain A Regional Network Of Comprehensive Prevention Services Through Hemophilia Treatment Centers to Persons With Hemophilia and Related Disorders Including Women, Minorities and the Underserved. Under this broad aim we will lay out our comprehensive, culturally sensitive, family-centered care services and their expansion, our communication within the region and administrative mechanisms. These include outreach and education, orientation and training programs, maintenance of appropriate management and evaluation systems, maintenance of a prevention evaluation network to assess the efficacy of prevention services by increasing the capacity for data collection, moving from paper to electronic and our participation in the coordinating committee. Our plan as stated will promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. Many of our aims will facilitate reducing health disparities and accelerate the adoption of health behaviors while improving prevention effectiveness through cost-based studies. Some aims will be directly transferable to other chronic disease populations in the general public such as the evaluation of obesity and menorrhagia.

Challenges: Providing care to persons with a rare, chronic disease in a large geographic area presents significant challenges. This region of the country has realized unprecedented growth over the past decade and this has strained existing health care resources at a time of level funding. In addition, there is over 90% penetration of managed care in the payer market providing challenges to the HTC staff in coordinating care within those systems. Supplementing unreimbursed care for patients is a primary response to this challenge. There are large groups of ethnic and racial minorities in some of the states providing language and culture challenges. Goals and objectives: The goals of this project are as follows: (a) Foster direct patient services including comprehensive care systems that provide culturally sensitive, family-centered care coordinated through a regional system of hemophilia diagnostic and treatment centers. Provide access to comprehensive call for all currently served, underserved, or newly identified patients with hemophilia/HIV and their families by providing direct services not reimbursed by third party payers; (b) Place care emphasis on prevention to educe the complications and morbidity associated with hemophilia; (c) Provide services to women with congenital bleeding disorders; (d) Coordinate services with State Title V MCH programs, prevention, education and peer support activities of the NHF and prevention and education initiatives of the CDC. Methodology: Continue the existing structure of HTCs in Region VIII using past successes of treatment center approaches including direct patient care service provision of comprehensive care and diagnosis of patients, education, outreach to underserved populations, outreach to women with bleeding disorders and preventions of morbidities associated with hemophilia. Expand services to persons with clotting disorders within the same HTC structure. Experience to date: The HTCs in Region VIII have a history of excellent care and organizational coordination, and each center has developed a strong referral network for all patients within their catchment area that assures access to care for these patients. This region has strong leadership and a history of successful clinical research that enhances patient care.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

A regional network of ten hemophilia treatment centers in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee will be coordinated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and provide comprehensive care and prevention services to persons with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. In 2005, Region IV-North (comprising nine hemophilia treatment centers [HTCs] in North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee) had a total of 1,848 active patients with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. Hemophilia patients constitute 61.5% of the total patients, while 27.6% have von Willebrand disease and 10.9% have other bleeding disorders. In 2005, there were 380 active female patients, an increase of 25.2% over the 2004 total. Almost 22% of the active patients are from ethnic minority groups, with an explosive increase in Hispanics. In comparison to U.S. averages, there are higher poverty rates and lower educational levels within the region, predisposing individuals to suboptimal behaviors in relation to diet, exercise, and use of health care services. The network will collaborate with regional lay organizations and the four non-federally funded centers in the region to deliver appropriately tailored prevention messages aimed at reducing complications of bleeding disorders and improving health across the lifespan, with the intention of attaining and measuring specific outcomes to reduce complications. Further, the region will redouble its outreach to underserved populations, such as women and minorities, to integrate them into the HTC system. All of these efforts will be systematically evaluated to assess their efficacy. Surveillance of patients enrolled in the CDC's Universal Data Collection (UDC) project, which has collected samples and data from over 18,000 individuals nationally since 1998, will continue in order to monitor the safety of the blood supply. The network will also expand upon the UDC program to collect data that could be used for clinical research projects leading to improved health outcomes for individuals with bleeding disorders, accelerated adoption of healthy behaviors, the reduction or elimination of health disparities among various ethnic and racial groups and between genders, and the achievement of greater efficiency in the core public health infrastructure.

Regional networks developed enabling and strengthening intra- and inter-state cooperation and collaboration. In 1995, the CDC provided direct funding to the twelve hemophilia regions following a Congressional mandate to monitor blood product safety and hemophilia disease progression, including arthropathy. During the past ten years funds from the Hematologic Disease Branch has assisted Region X (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington) with building center and regional infrastructure including expanded data collection capabilities for surveillance. Funds have also enhanced inter-regional collaboration in the US West. The Universal Data and Serum Specimen collection System for Hemophilia and other bleeding disorders has been enrolling participants since 1997/98 and has provided a robust data bank. During the next five years, Region X in collaboration with other federal regions will begin more focused public health research with the hemophilia and bleeding disorders community that may be extrapolated to other populations with chronic conditions and diagnoses. Region X is an area of the United States with urban, rural and frontier counties. The majority of the population in this region lives north of the 45th parallel. The region also has an incidence of obesity and overweight in hemophilia patients and the general region that mirrors the national averages. The Region X research interests include: 1) whether the health disparities experienced by rural and frontier citizens also extends to persons with bleeding disorders or does care for a bleeding disorder provided by HTCs decrease the health disparities; 2) whether persons living in counties without physicians and/or hospitals have poorer physical and health outcomes compared to others with similar diagnosis, especially persons with milder severity; 3) the impact of less ambient vitamin D on joint disease and bone health/density; and 4) the relationship between perceived ability to engage in activity, actual level of activity, unemployment due to disability, pain and quality of life.

The Regional Core Center (RCC) office is located in Atlanta, Georgia and shares an office with Hemophilia of Georgia, Inc. The RCC emphasizes a pro-active orientation toward bleeding disorder care. This program will further the mission of the CDC in promoting heath and quality of life in persons with bleeding disorders by preventing and controlling disease, injury and disability. The goals and objectives of this regional program were designed to reduce the complications and morbidity associated with bleeding disorders, as well as to promote access to integrated and family-centered services for individuals with bleeding disorders in Region IV South. Comprehensive systems of care are necessary, as those receiving care outside of an HTC have a 60% higher mortality rate than those receiving care in federally funded HTCs (CDC). Objectives will focus on those patients from traditionally underserved populations. Prevention programs will strive to reduce the impact on the public health system by, for example, decreasing the number of days missed from work and school. The RCC will be responsible for program evaluation and monitoring through required affiliate reporting, data reports, assessment of Universal Data Collection (UDC) Project participation, site visits, needs assessments, and consumer input. Other specific project objectives include: (1) provide continuous screening for HIV and Hepatitis A, B, and C; (2) facilitate improved regional information management systems, data collection and evaluation; (3) expand the UDC cohort through recruitment of individuals with genetic bleeding disorders; (4) transition the national database to a web-based application; (5) expand the database with additional relevant date related to women's issues and other important clinical outcomes; and (6) address areas of concern unique to Region IV South regarding healthcare disparities. This hemophilia care program strives to improve the quality and years of healthy lives for those living with bleeding disorders in Region IV South. Prevention and outreach efforts aimed at the traditionally underserved will eliminate the region's health disparities by providing quality healthcare services, regardless of an individual's race, ethnicity, age, or gender.

The proposed study, \"Adding Physical Activity/Subtracting Complications\" will include designing, implementing and evaluating a new program aimed at increasing physical activity in persons ages 13-21 with bleeding disorders as part of comprehensive care through HTCs. The significance of this project is clearly evident through the data previously collected through UDC. 24% of the 926 patients from Region VII who have participated in UDC are categorized as being overweight, 17 % report using canes, crutches, or walkers, 3.4% use wheelchairs, and 26% of the total patients reported restrictions in their activity level. During their annual comprehensive clinic visit, participants in the proposed study would receive educational materials describing physical activity plans for the upcoming year from which to choose.

Building on previous federal funding for staff and clinical infrastructure, the first two five-year periods of CDC funding focused on the development of a national database to collect critical data that enabled outcome assessment including blood-borne viral transmission, joint disease, inhibitor formation, and mortality. This database is now the largest clinical outcomes database of a rare chronic disease in the world. This third five-year period will focus on expansion of the cohort and the refinement of data collected to continue to characterize sub-populations, including hemophilia A and B, women with bleeding disorders, von Willebrand disease, and rare bleeding disorders. Major efforts have begun to increase the sophistication of data collection methodologies and to finalize the transition from a paper to an electronic system that is currently being converted to a web-based interface with the CDC. This infrastructure will greatly increase our capacity for national clinical research to improve care, support outcomes-based standardization, and defend against efforts by payers to cut costs by denying access to therapeutic regimens and products. Data collected to date has shown decreased mortality and morbidity among patients who receive care at federally funded HTCs. Care is accessible and patients have many resources to overcome traditional barriers that face families with chronic diseases, including linkages with other specialists, community based social services and patient advocacy and support. This model of care, which is coordinated in response to agreed upon national and regional objectives, is a successful model of a comprehensive and collaborative public health approach to the management of a chronic disorder that may be applicable to other rare and/or expensive chronic diseases. The regional network infrastructure and data collection capacity may also provide fertile ground for the assessment of prevention and intervention strategies for broad public health concerns like nutrition and obesity and compliance that affect the general population.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the Medical Home Surveillance and Screening Program (MHSSP) are to enable child health professionals to integrate developmental surveillance and screening into the medical home; educate child health professionals about the importance of early identification, evaluation, and management of autism within the medical home; build leadership in early  hearing detection and intervention (EHDI); and establish partnerships with, and disseminate information to, key related organizations and health care professionals at the community, state, and national levels in order to enhance their understanding of developmental surveillance and screening, autism, and early hearing detection and intervention.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The MHSSP will use American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy recommendations around developmental surveillance and screening; autism identification, evaluation, and management; and early hearing detection and intervention to promote early identification and intervention of children with developmental disabilities. The MHSSP will accomplish this through various activities planned throughout the 5-year cooperative agreement. Activities include convening an expert work group to identify an appropriate spread strategy for developmental surveillance and screening and autism; implementing that strategy; developing a developmental surveillance and screening eQIPP module; implementing a Periodic Survey of Fellows; supporting AAP EHDI Chapter Champions; and other activities to spread implementation of AAP recommendations.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our broad, long-term objective is to determine the genetic epidemiology of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Segregation analyses show that VTE is highly heritable. The high prevalence of VTE and its known environmental risk factors suggest that multiple genes of varying effects are involved in determining VTE susceptibility. We hypothesize that (1) there are specific discoverable genes and genotypes that greatly increase the risk of VTE, (2) some genotypes may manifest through VTE risk factor exposure, and (3) there are quantitative trait loci (QTL) that pleiotropically affect both plasma hemostasis-related risk factors and VTE. To address these hypotheses, we will use the resources of the eight Thrombophilia Center Pilot sites and the Centers for Disease Control to identify susceptibility genes in high-risk VTE pedigrees. Our specific aims are:  [unreadable] Aim 1. To identify and extend high-risk VTE pedigrees, collect demographic and VTE risk factor data and samples for DNA and plasma, and genotype informative individuals within these pedigrees for 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphism-based markers evenly spaced throughout the genome. We will identify at least 75 high-risk VTE pedigrees suitable for linkage studies (at least 3 affected family members and ELOD scores=0.3 or higher); genotyping will be done on ~1200 family members; Aim 2. To map VTE susceptibility genes by genetic linkage analysis. We will use conventional linkage strategies, but we will also implement the latest methods that incorporate environmental covariates in the analysis; Aim 3. Using the high-risk VTE pedigrees and genotypes from Aim 1, (a) to determine the joint action of genes on VTE risk and a number of quantitative hemostasis-related phenotypes; and (b) to identify regions containing genes (e.g., QTL) that influence variation in highly-heritable quantitative phenotypes that genetically correlate with VTE using variance components approach for quantitative traits; and Aim 4. To revise the Mayo Thrombophilia Registry to conform to the Thrombosis/Hemostasis Research Network Registry, and continue data abstraction, prospective outcomes follow-up, and Network Registry data entry for Mayo Thrombophilia Center patients. Implications: Through such efforts, the Network will facilitate the development of a family-based gene-discovery research resource  [unreadable] that will be positioned to characterize genetic risk of VTE and to conduct future translational studies, including interventions targeted to high risk groups.

However, (a) many of the  [unreadable] mechanisms predisposing individuals, particularly those of black race, are not known, (b) health  [unreadable] care delivery to these patients in the U.S. is often highly variable and (c) public awareness of these  [unreadable] disorders and their seriousness is low.  [unreadable] Objectives: To create a Comprehensive Thrombosis Clinic structure that (a) allows epidemiologic  [unreadable] research to be done through use of a clinic patient registry, (b) enables the addition of a biologic  [unreadable] sample repository to allow basic research questions to be asked off the Registry, (c) uses the  [unreadable] Registry as an identification point of eligible patients for prospective studies on thrombosis and  [unreadable] thrombophilia, (d) creates patient support group structures within North Carolina and (e) educates  [unreadable] the public, patients and health care providers about thrombosis.

[unreadable] Methods: In a collaborative effort with 7 other funded thrombophilia centers demographic and clinic  [unreadable] data on outpatients and inpatients with thrombosis and/or thrombophilia will be entered into a  [unreadable] Registry. These data will be used for collaborative epidemiologic studies. The principal investigator  [unreadable] of this grant application will focus on the study of patients with (a) rare clotting disorders (compound  [unreadable] thrombophilias), and (b) uncommon blood clots (abdominal venous thromboses). Retrospective  [unreadable] studies on the former and latter, and a prospective study of the latter patient population during  [unreadable] pregnancy are proposed. The Registry data will also be evaluated for differences in referral patterns  [unreadable] of patients of black compared to people of white race, and differences in the type of thrombosis they  [unreadable] have had. The biologic sample repository will serve as a resource to study yet unknown risk factors  [unreadable] of blood clots in people of black race. Finally, a mechanism is suggested to create patient support  [unreadable] groups throughout N.C. and to improve the education of the public and of health care providers  [unreadable] through structured seminars. Close collaboration with national non-profit patient and health care  [unreadable] provider organizations are suggested to maximize the success of these efforts.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] This prospective, cross-sectional epidemiological study will implement a developmental surveillance system to determine the prevalence of ASD in early childhood using a community-based screening and diagnostic protocol developed and evaluated by the FIRST WORDS(r) Project. Children will be recruited from a representative population-based sample of over 16,000 children born between April 2006 and March 2010 in 12 contiguous counties in the panhandle of Florida, who will be screened with a broadband parent-report surveillance checklist between 9 and 18 months of age. All children who fail and randomly selected children who pass the broadband screen will be invited to complete an autism-specific screen between 10 and 18 months. Two autism-specific screening tools will be used, one based on parent report and one based on an interactive videotaped systematic observation. Case ascertainment will be based a diagnostic evaluation to confirm or rule out ASD at 18 and 30 months of age with children who fail the autism-specific screen. In preliminary studies using this developmental surveillance system in Leon County, 67 children have been identified to date from a prospective sample of over 6,410 children screened between 6 and 24 months who have received a diagnosis of ASD at 30 months of age or older; 64 received a positive broadband screen and 66 a positive autism-specific screen. The following research aims will be addressed: 1) to determine the prevalence of ASD at two ages in early childhood, 18 and 30 months, and two birth cohorts; 2) to estimate validity measures of the broadband parent report and autism-specific screening tools; 3) to compare the autism-specific parent-report screening tool with the autism-specific interactive screening tool; 4) to describe  [unreadable] demographic and developmental characteristics of this cross-sectional sample, which will include about 1/2 the birth rate of 2 small urban and 10 surrounding rural counties; and 5) to identify barriers that may impede and strategies to improve the screening and referral process for parents and professionals.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] In response to CDC RFA-DD-07-007 (Implementing Surveillance to Determine Prevalence of the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)...in Early Childhood Populations), we propose CA-MECA, to be conducted under the leadership of the California Department of Health Services (DHS) and in partnership with Kaiser Permanente of Northern California (KPNC), and multiple health and service providers in Santa Clara County (SCC), California. Our primary goal is to establish a scientifically rigorous, multi-source surveillance system to accurately determine the population-based prevalence of  ASD in young children (<4 years old) for two birth cohort years (2005-2006) in SCC, which has ~26,000 births/year and a very diverse population. Doing so is relevant to CDC's goal to prevent birth defects and developmental disabilities and improve the health of people with disabilities. There are three components to the CAMECA proposal that reflect our specific aims: 1) To identify young children (<48 months) with possible or definite autism in the county born in the two target years, we will work with the local regional center for the developmentally disabled, community clinics, and specialty providers. Records will be abstracted to collect data to determine final surveillance case status by expert review and to describe characteristics of the children with ASD. Additional data will be obtained from birth certificates. Both current and birth residence prevalence estimates will be calculated. 2) To identify possible gaps in the surveillance system and to reach an under-served segment of the population, we will conduct routine screening for developmental disabilities and ASD in 18-30 month old children born in 2006 at two pediatric clinics that serve a lower income, primarily Hispanic population, with appropriate referrals for clinical evaluation. After linkage to the surveillance system, we will compare prevalence in the screened sub-group to those born in 2005 and seen at the same clinics but not screened, to evaluate completeness of overall prevalence estimates and to provide a more accurate estimate of prevalence in a Hispanic population. 3) To increase awareness and early referrals for autism evaluations, we will conduct outreach and education to general pediatricians and other relevant community groups, assembling and convening a community advisory board to assist us. The two data collection components include on-going quality control, and will be evaluated for completeness, accuracy and feasibility of wider application. Reports will be widely distributed. Data from the CA-MECA project will be valuable for obtaining accurate counts of young children with ASD to track changes over time, to plan and deliver services for affected children and their families, to uncover risk factors for ASD, and to identify underserved groups, as well as providing information to improve early screening and diagnostic practices.

       " \"Project Summary Abstract Patients with thalassemia major require regular red cell transfusions to circumvent their deficient or absent production of globin. As a consequence of these lifelong transfusion programs, affected patients have an intense and sustained exposure to blood-borne pathogens and may be a sentinel population for the recognition of new infectious agents in the blood supply. Regular transfusion programs also lead to other transfusion-related complications including red cell alloimmunization and iron overload. The latter is a particularly devastating complication of therapy and requires regular chelation therapy to prevent widespread organ damage and early death from cardiac failure or arrhythmias. Previously, the CDC- sponsored [unreadable]Prevention of Complications of Iron Overload[unreadable] developed a multi-center study of transfusion- related and other complications of thalassemia. The present study offers an opportunity to continue the regular collection of relevant clinical, demographic and genetic data to address the major goals of characterizing and preventing the complications of thalassemia. Using a variety of strategies and tools, The Thalassemia Program of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia will continue to enroll patients in the surveillance projects, establish methods for consumer input and assess and meet the needs of unserved or underserved populations, provide multi-disciplinary, comprehensive care, identify patients with newly acquired transfusion-transmitted infections and other disease-related and treatment-related complications, and disseminate the study findings. In addition, our Thalassemia Program has identified two areas of new investigation: (1) the use of the longitudinal cohort to characterize the current mortality of patients with thalassemia major and differences in mortality related to treatment in or outside of a treatment center and (2) defining the current risk of postsplenectomy events, in particular sepsis and thrombosis. Overall, these studies will better define the optimal therapy of thalassemia and will also contribute to improvements in the treatment of other disorders requiring regular red cell transfusions. Project Narrative By characterizing in detail the complications of thalassemia, the proposed studies will not only improve the management of this inherited blood disorder but will also influence the treatment of all patients requiring short-term and long-term red cell transfusion programs.\",\n",
       " \"Project Abstract The Comprehensive Thalassemia Program of the Children's Memorial Hospital (CMH) is committed to providing state-of[unreadable]the-art medical service services using a multidisciplinary approach, including ongoing hemo-vigilance activities. Patients with thalassemia are a vulnerable population who comprise the single largest group of red cell transfusion users at Children's Memorial Hospital and other major U.S. thalassemia treatment centers. As such, they remain at high risk from both known and potential blood-borne pathogens and other complications related to transfusion therapy. This application will delineate expected contributions of CMH to ongoing initiatives by the CDC on blood safety in thalassemia and will describe current and proposed activities to enhance medical services and facilitate research in the prevention and improved management of disease- and/or transfusion-related complications. As the largest thalassemia treatment center in the Midwestern United States, the Comprehensive Thalassemia Program of the Children's Memorial Hospital is uniquely positioned to provide expertise over a wide geographic area to an increasingly diverse ethnic and cultural population affected by this condition. Relevance Red cell transfusions are a cornerstone for the management of thalassemia, a serious inherited blood disorder. Activities directed at improvements in blood safety monitoring have broad implication on the health of the general public. Projects proposed in this application are aimed at improvements in surveillance for blood borne infections, iron overload and other transfusion-related complications.\",\n",
       " \"This is a new application for a comprehensive Thalassemia care center, at Children's Hospital Boston (CHB), with off-site collaboration with the Thalassemia program of Children's Hospital of Atlanta. Both organizations have been participants as subcontractors in the first five year period of the CDC-led Thalassemia project. The objectives of this proposal are to provide assessment for, and prevention and management of complications of Thalassemia. The target populations include individuals in New England and in the Atlanta region, with transfusion-dependent beta Thalassemia (Thal), alpha Thal (homozygous and hemoglobin H disease), Thal intermedia, and related disorders. The burden of disease in Thal is high. No other single group of humans receives as many fresh red cell transfusions in a lifetime as patients with transfusion-dependent Thal (essentially monthly transfusion for life). Therefore, screening for blood borne diseases is a crucial part of management. In addition, with transfusions comes obligatory iron overload, and iron-related heart disease, liver disease, and endocrinopathies are major causes of morbidity and mortality in this patient group. Good compliance with oral iron chelators is highly correlated with improved survival, but even apparently well-chelated patients, plus non-transfused Thal intermedia patients, can develop over decades, life-threatening iron-related complications including heart failure, arrhythmia, cirrhosis, diabetes, as well as infertility and other reproductive endocrine disorders. Faced with these challenges, the keys to management, surveillance and prevention of complications include regular comprehensive visits at expert centers with specialists and tests skilled in Thal care, ongoing blood safety surveillance and tests for iron and its sequelae, as well as community outreach, collaboration with patient support groups, family and patient education, and continuing psychosocial assessment and support. The Thalassemia program at CHB has been active for more than 40 years, and has led many of the developments in the field, particularly in chelation therapy. The specific aims of this project are: (I) to provide comprehensive care in Thal, screen for potential complications, and implement strategies to prevent complications; (II) to initiate a patient/family education program modeled on the [unreadable]Do the Five[unreadable] strategy used by hemophilia centers and CDC to promote comprehensive care, vaccines for blood-borne viruses, adequate chelation, and blood safety monitoring. (III) To establish research collaboration with the NIH-sponsored Thalassemia Clinical Research Network (to which CHB and CHOA belong; and principal investigator Dr. Neufeld is chair of the TCRN steering committee.) Each aim contains a research component for assessment of clinical outcomes, aimed at generating hypothesis for further research, and providing opportunities to improve care and reduce complications. Narrative: The purpose of this project is to improve care and long-term health outcomes in patients with Thalassemia (Cooley's Anemia). This is a new application to join an ongoing cooperative endeavor of several large US Thalassemia programs, with Children's Hospital, Boston as the primary site, and Emory/Children's Healthcare of Atlanta as a collaborating site. The goals will be achieved by providing comprehensive medical services to patients with transfusion-dependent Thalassemia, and screening patients for blood-borne infections and for complications of the disorder, which are related to transfusional iron overload and to treatment of iron problems. We propose a nationwide educational strategy analogous to the efforts launched in the hemophilia community, with CDC support, for comprehensive care. We propose to pilot a new database under development at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, to improve data abstraction from the electronic medical records. Finally, we propose formal collaboration with the Thalassemia clinical research network of the National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute, to leverage the ongoing longitudinal screening in both networks.\",\n",
       " 'The current project will develop and maintain systems for the management of patients with thalassemia at the Southern California Comprehensive Thalassemia Center (SCCTC). This will be accomplished by 1) providing comprehensive healthcare services to prevent complications through assessment, surveillance, outreach, education, consultation, and management; (2) participating in blood safety monitoring and surveillance efforts; (3) maintaining a prevention evaluation monitoring system to assess the efficacy of prevention services; (4) collaborating with lay organizations to deliver consistent prevention messages aimed at preventing complications; and (5) develop research ideas and methods to determine, measure, and modify treatment and follow-up protocols to maximize the achievement of optimal medical-driven outcomes. The Southern California Comprehensive Thalassemia Center will address these goals by 1) working closely with the other CDC thalassemia centers to participate in blood safety monitoring and research projects at a national level, 2) continuing active participation in the Thalassemia Clinical Research Network, 3) developing outreach and education programs at this center and by working collaboratively with the Northern California Thalassemia center, and 4) maintaining and developing new research initiatives based on data from our local multidisciplinary comprehensive care model.  The thalassemia research initiatives from the Southern California Comprehensive Thalassemia Center in general are related to the assessment and management of transfusional iron overload and measurement of tissue iron by magnetic resonance imaging. Specific projects based on data collected from the CDC comprehensive care model but funded externally to the CDC program include 1) the relationship between cardiac iron and cardiac function, 2) the utility of MRI for the measurement of liver iron, 3) the efficacy of the deferasirox for the removal of cardiac iron, and 4) the relation between pancreatic iron and pancreatic function. These studies leverage the unique expertise of the Southern California Comprehensive Thalassemia Center of the Center co-director, Dr. Wood, who is a cardiologist and biomedical engineer.  The Southern California Comprehensive Thalassemia Center will continue the model of using the analysis of data collected in the context of providing multidisciplinary comprehensive clinical management of patients with thalassemia to modify approaches to treatment and to generate hypotheses for more formal study of treatments and management approaches that will reduce the complications of patients with thalassemia and improve their health. Project Narrative To implement a blood safety monitoring surveillance system at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles to benefit persons with thalassemia. Information from this system will be used by the Hematologic Diseases Branch of CDC to assess the safety of the blood supply and to develop and monitor the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce or prevent the complications of thalassemia.',\n",
       " \"Documentation of Capacity and Capability of the Northern California Thalassemia Center (NCTC) Prior work experience in conducting and addressing the research and programmatic objectives of the Research Initiative for the Prevention of Complications of Thalassemia Since its establishment 17 years ago, the NCTC has developed a growing statewide program dedicated to delivering comprehensive multidisciplinary care, subspecialty services, community outreach, and opportunities to participate in research trials. The primary site of the NCTC is Children's Hospital and Research Center Oakland (CHRCO) and a network of seven satellite medical centers throughout the state of California. As one of only a handful of comprehensive thalassemia centers in the nation, the NCTC is a rare resource and authority on many issues related to thalassemia. It is home to some of the most experienced thalassemia researchers and healthcare providers in the world, has an active and wide-reaching outreach program, and boasts an excellent infrastructure and an exemplary record of research and dissemination. Since 2002, the NCTC has participated in CDC grant U27/CCU92210, offering comprehensive multi-disciplinary care to patients throughout California, providing outreach and education to patients and communities, playing a lead role in national research trials in thalassemia, and enrolling patients from CHRCO in the CDC Thalassemia Universal Data Collection Program and investigations of sero-conversions and suspected blood borne pathogens. In addition to its ongoing participation in the CDC trial [unreadable]Prevention of the Complications of Thalassemia,[unreadable] we have coordinated multi-center research trials, assumed a leading role in the Thalassemia Clinical Research Network, and undertaken numerous basic, clinical, and translational research studies. A clear description of the populations to be reached and how they will be identified, enrolled and made part of all research initiatives In 2006, the NCTC provided comprehensive care to 140 thalassemia patients at Children's Hospital and Research Center at Oakland (CHRCO), a 12% increase in the number of patients seen in the previous year. Of these 140, 42% have beta thalassemia and 43% are transfusion dependent. Approximately 51% are women and 75% are of Asian descent. Within the entire network of CHRCO and its satellites, nearly 400 patients across California receive care through the NCTC. In 2006, 91% of the patients in the NCTC received a comprehensive annual visit. During these comprehensive annual visits, and via widely disseminated research flyers and outreach efforts (including over 60 activities in 2006), patients are educated about ongoing research initiatives at the NCTC. More than 300 NCTC patients have consented to participate in research studies through the TCRN alone. Outreach to both the identified thalassemia community and the at-risk population has been a top priority and continues to be a mainstay of the NCTC's work. The tremendous influx in the Asian population and growing awareness of thalassemia and its complications have created an increased demand for patient services, education, and counseling statewide. Recently, the NCTC expanded efforts into new Asian communities within the Stockton, Fresno, and San Jose areas and to the Middle Eastern and Indian communities. The NCTC website continues to offer updated information about thalassemia, new research and clinical trial opportunities, and allows individuals to email questions to NCTC. An outline of the surveillance data collection systems in place and how they will be employed and expanded to support and underpin the programs to be implemented under this new project Infections are the second most common cause of death in thalassemia major. Pathogens are transmitted by blood transfusion, and altered host immunity from hypersplenism and iron overload contribute to the morbidity. Specific transfusion protocols are followed and all transfused patients are screened annually for hepatitis B surface antibody, surface antigen and core antibody and HIV. Transfused patients are also screened annually for hepatitis C surface antibody and if positive, PCR for hepatitis C is measured. Liver function tests are obtained every 3 months and if elevated, patients are again screened for hepatitis B, C, and A; CMV, EBV, Parvovirus, and HIV. These protocols and infrastructure have supported the enrollment of 55 patients from NCTC on CDC U27/CCU922110. Continued funding will allow us to follow these patients annually with ongoing specimen collection and shipping to the CDC and completion of annual data forms. We will also be able to enroll an additional 30 patients over the next funding cycle. A full range of services and screening for complications are available for thalassemia patients at the NCTC. The Hemoglobinopathy Reference Laboratory at NCTC is the reference laboratory for the State of California Newborn Screening Program. We are the only program in North America to universally screen all births for both beta-thalassemia and alpha-thalassemia. Patients are referred to the center through newborn screening and outreach activities. We have been successful in providing annual comprehensive exams to over 90% of patients with the goal of providing annual screening, surveillance and treatment for iron overload, heart disease, liver disease, endocrine dysfunction, nutritional deficiencies and disorders of bone metabolism. Our future goals include expanded screening for cardiac iron deposition using newly available MRI technology and pulmonary hypertension. Indications of research hypotheses and research questions to be addressed and answered throughout the life of this new award cycle The NCTC continues to take a leading role as PI or Co-Pi on almost all of the protocols for the TCRN. In addition, several investigators at the NCTC are recipients of K and other research awards and are coordinating independent studies in thalassemia. Examples of current research hypotheses under investigation include: 1) Deferoxamine (DFO) and deferiprone (L1) combination therapy improves left ventricular function more rapidly than DFO/placebo therapy among transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia patients with abnormal resting ejection fractions, 2) Arginine and sidenafil will both show clinical efficacy in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, 3) Nine months of administration of low-dose subcutaneous decitabine can produce clinically significant (2-3g/dl) increases in total hemoglobin in patients with thalassemia intermedia, 4) Antioxidant therapy with a combination of RS-Alpha-Lipoic Acid (LA) and L-Carnitine (ALCAR) will produce a measurable decline in oxidative stress in patients with thalassemia, 5) Increased platelet activation and hypercoagulability is the primary cause of the development of pulmonary hypertension, and 6) Zinc supplementation can improve bone health as measured by bone mineral density, bone strength, and markers of bone formation and resorption in beta-thalassemia patients. Presentation of completed and in-process studies undertaken with an indication of how new data and research will contribute to enhanced outcome-based initiatives for patient identification, clinical care and follow-up, including family and caregiver dynamics. A major focus of the NCTC is to undertake outcome-based research that will result in improved diagnosis and treatment of patients with thalassemia and assistance for their families. Our multi-disciplinary approach to outcome-based research addresses the wide spectrum of problems facing this disease that range from cultural obstacles affecting immigrants to new iron chelators, nutrition1-6, management of medical complications, and experimental therapy7-11. These subjects are briefly summarized here and are referred to throughout the text. We are California's Reference Hemoglobinopathy Center for newborn screening and the NIH-sponsored central Hemoglobin Diagnosis Laboratory for North America12-16. This has given us the opportunity to prospectively monitor the epidemiology of thalassemia17-20. Long-term, prospective follow-up of newborns who have undergone DNA and genetic modifier diagnosis has enabled us to better understand the genotype/phenotype correlations20-23. Information from these studies has led to the establishment of North America's only universal alpha-thalassemia screening program, defined the clinical importance of Hb H Constant Spring, Hb E Thalassemia6, 24-29 and other new variants30-32. In addition, there is ongoing research to understand the cultural and social impact of thalassemia on the changing ethnic groups33, 34. Iron overload and its management The NCTC is the principal investigator on several approaches to improve iron chelation and monitor their toxicity. This includes the development of new chelators, including long-acting starch Desferal35, and combination therapy with deferasirox and Desferal36. In addition, we are the co-investigator on several prospective trials evaluating deferiprone37, deferasirox, continuous desferal for cardiac disease or cardiac hemosiderosis. Linked to the new chelators is a comprehensive program addressing non-invasive technology to diagnosis iron overload including new studies measuring pituitary, gonadal, and cardiac iron with SQUID and MRI38-43. Management of complications Treatment of thalassemia requires evidence-based information. Our program focuses on prospective studies to prevent and improve the diagnosis and treatment of complications5, 25, 44-53. Complications and therapy under study include aspirin, arginine, sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension, antioxidant supplementation, combination therapy for hepatitis54, 55, surveillance programs of blood safety13, new approaches to cardiac disease7, preimplantation therapy for pregnancy56, 57, and the problem of transitioning patients into adulthood58. New therapy Our approach to therapy has focused on fetal hemoglobin F modulator trials, including hydroxyurea, darbepoietin, and recently Decitabine25, 26, 59-63. In addition, we have been prospectively evaluating new approaches to stem cell transplantation in order to decrease morbidity and increase access for patients without allogeneic matches64-67.

       " \"ABSTRACT: The model New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Medical College of Cornell University (NYPH-WMC) Thalassemia Center is the largest program in the New York area for the care of over 100 thalassemia patients and their families which aims to promote health and improve the quality of life of thalassemia patients. Specifically, the NYPH-WMC aims to provide comprehensive medical, psychosocial and genetic services. A multidisciplinary on-site diagnostic, treatment and support team comprised of the director, a pediatric hematologist, pediatric and adult hepatologists, endocrinologists, cardiologists, radiologist, biochemist, geneticist, social worker and psychologist, genetic counselor, nurse practitioner, and study and outreach coordinators delivers comprehensive preventive services and participates in clinical and basic research to advance the understanding of thalassemia and improve management. Regular transfusions are administered at bi-monthly visits, monthly chemistries, quarterly evaluations and annual assessments including hepatic, endocrine and cardiac evaluations, hearing and eye exams are performed with surveillance and monitoring of clinical outcomes. Consultative comprehensive healthcare services are provided to the local and regional community of thalassemia patients and healthcare providers. Culturally competent screening, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis are also provided on-site and in outreach programs to identify those who can benefit from education, treatment and prevention services as well as to assess the needs of the underserved. Collaborations with local and national consumer organizations are maintained with the Thalassemia Action Group (TAG), the Cooley's Anemia Foundation (CAF) and local healthcare providers at smaller non-federally funded regional institutions which care for fewer thalassemia patients. Annual patient/parent educational conferences are conducted and annual medical update symposiums are held for healthcare providers. Comprehensive healthcare services are directed at attaining and measuring specific outcomes to prevent and reduce complications of transfusional iron overload implementing the CDC's Thalassemia Universal Data Collection Surveillance Program for the investigation of seroconversion suspected, blood borne agents and possible bacterial contamination along with other data collection and surveillance efforts. NARRATIVE: The overall purpose of the NYPH-WMC Thalassemia Center's partnership with the CDC is aimed at promoting the health and improving the quality of life of patients with thalassemia by providing a prevention evaluation network to monitor blood safety and the delivery of comprehensive healthcare services to monitor and prevent the complications of transfusional iron overload, and to conduct research to enhance prevention and implement preventive strategies that will advocate and contribute to the development of public health policies.\",\n",

Medical care for people with spina bifida (PWSB) can be complex and long term. Improved understanding about care practices of spina bifida programs and about health outcomes associated with clinical practices is needed to improve outcomes and quality of life for PWSB. OHSU has a long history of addressing systems of care for PWSB, and this project builds on experience that includes systematic collection and evaluation of clinical data. Evidence from other complex and chronic conditions has shown that a National Patient Registry allows for comparison of outcome data among care centers and identification of strategies to improve outcomes. Assessment by the Spina Bifida Association in collaboration with other groups identified need for a national infrastructure to support clinical research and a systematic approach to improving quality of care for PWSB. This project takes a step towards a national patient registry. The long-term goal of this project is to improve health outcomes and quality of life for PWSB. This project contributes to building the clinical evidence base about current health practices in spina bifida care and health outcomes; this evidence is needed aid development of national standards of care for PWSB that can be applied to reduce disparities and improve health outcomes across clinics, populations and regions of the US. The objective of this application is to test the feasibility of utilizing a standardized registry tool to collect data from patients with spina bifida and to implement the tool to collect patient data. A complete source for spina bifida patient data will make it possible to compare treatment care and outcomes of populations and identify areas for future research to guide best clinical practices and improve the lives of PWSB. The feasibility of utilizing a standardized registry tool for collecting data on patients with spina bifida will be addressed by collecting data from 125 patients in our clinic every year for 3 years, using the data collection tool provided for this project. We will also assess how easy it is to use these forms in a clinical setting, and to integrate use into existing data collection systems. The goal of this project is to improve the health and quality of life of people with spina bifida. It addresses the \"Healthy People 2010\" priority area of disability and secondary conditions and is aligned with NCBDDD\\'s performance goal to improve the health and development of all people with disabilities or potentially disabling conditions. It implements steps to establish the foundation for a National Spina Bifida Patient Registry, which will ultimately be applied to improve care and health of people with spina bifida.

The purpose of this proposal is to work collaboratively with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other grantee spina bifida clinics to pilot a disease specific national registry to improve care for individuals with spina bifida. Specific Aims: 1.) Pilot test the spina bifida registry tool on at least 125 patients attending the Cincinnati multi-disciplinary spina bifida clinic. 2.) Work collaboratively with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other grantee demonstration programs to evaluate and improve the proposed national spina bifida registry tool. Background: Spina bifida is the most common permanently disabling birth defect with an estimated 70,000 individuals living with the more significant forms of this neural tube defect. A study of medical services available to patients with spina bifida found significant variability among the responding spina bifida clinics regarding the number of patients serviced, types of specialty care available, frequency of clinic sessions, and level of care coordination offered. This Spina Bifida Registry Demonstration Project is a pilot program aimed at developing a national clinical registry to assess variability across clinics and to evaluate outcomes-based medical care. The Cincinnati Spina Bifida Clinic has the clinical, administrative, and research support necessary to become one of the pilot demonstration programs. Methods: Facility: Data will be collected from the patients attending the multi- disciplinary Cincinnati Spina Bifida Clinics in the Division of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics at the Cincinnati Children\\'s Hospital Medical Center. The clinics include adult and pediatric patients and are serviced on-site by developmental pediatrics, neurosurgery, orthopedics, physiatry, and urology. The clinic meets the first 4 Mondays of each month for an average of 48 weeks per year. Staff of the Cincinnati Spina Bifida Clinic participated in the 2008 clinic survey. Subjects: We will enroll a minimum of 125 of our 327 patients in this multi-site pilot registry project. Data Collection: We will annually collect registry information using either paper collection tools or an internet-based registry tool. Spina bifida is the most common permanently disabling birth defect with an estimated 70,000 individuals living with the more significant forms of this neural tube defect. Individuals with spina bifida receive specialized care from multi- disciplinary clinics which report significant variability in the number of patients serviced, types of specialty care available, frequency of clinic sessions, and level of care coordination offered. The recent \"Evidence-Based Practice in Spina Bifida: Developing a Research Agenda\" symposium determined there was an immediate need for higher quality research involving greater numbers of subjects across multiple spina bifida centers and utilizing standardized variables and outcome measures. This Spina Bifida Patient Registry Demonstration Project is a pilot program aimed at developing a national clinical registry to assess variability across clinics and to evaluate outcomes-based medical care.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION:  (Provided by applicant.)  There are an estimated 70,000 people in the United States currently living with Spina Bifida, which is the most common permanently disabling birth defect in this country. Spina Bifida is a neural tube defect that happens in the first month of pregnancy when the spinal column doesn't close completely. Thanks to new medical treatments and technology, most people born with Spina Bifida can expect to live a normal life expectancy. Those with this challenging birth defect are living longer, more productive lives than was dreamed of just 20 years ago. People with Spina Bifida face special challenges because of this birth defect. Spina Bifida occurs in an estimated 7 out of every 10,000 live births in the United States and although this number seems to be going down in the rest of the country that is not necessarily true in Alabama. Children born with Spina Bifida face a number of obstacles including hydrocephalus in more that 90% of cases, as well as paralysis and weakness of the extremities and decreased bladder/bowel control. Phase I of the project was highly successful. The Spina Bifida Association of America funded The Children's Hospital of Alabama (TCHA) and The Children's Hospital of Cincinnati to develop a diagnosis specific electronic medical record (EMR) for Spina Bifida clinics nation wide. The registry questions were embedded into to an electronic medical record (EMR) and will be used by the enrolled sites to electronically submit the required data. The Phase II specific aims are to enroll each Spina Bifida patient seen in the multi- disciplinary clinic willing to consent with no less than a minimum of 125 new patients annually. The data will be de-identified and submitted electronically to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in their pre-designed format. Each site will also be able to conduct their own research based on the information entered on their own patients provided all institutional approvals are in place for the protection of human subject research. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) intends to submit a full proposal in response to funding opportunity number RFA-DD-08-001, which will be titled The UAB Spina Bifida Patient Registry Demonstration Project. We feel strongly that we should be selected as one of the eight sites participating in this study based on our level of expertise, the significant volume of clinical care given, and the large and diverse patient population served in Alabama. In September 2007, the Children's Hospital of Alabama along with the Children's Hospital Cincinnati were chosen by the Spina Bifida Association of America (SBAA) to develop a spina bifida specific electronic medical record (EMR) that would be used in clinics nationwide to track patients living with spina bifida as well as raise the level of care that these patients receive. This selection was based in part on the fact that Betsy DeCesare, the Spina Bifida Clinic Coordinator at the Children's Hospital of Alabama (TCHA) was instrumental in a similar national data base project related to hemophilia at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. This EMR will be the instrument used to submit de-identified data to the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) registry project. Therefore, our clinic is most prepared and equipped to participate with the other selected sites over the next three years in an effort to improve the quality of care for individuals with spina bifida, and create an infrastructure to support evidence based clinical research. UAB is also home to many passionate national leaders in spina bifida. Dr. Jeffery Blount a neurosurgeon is currently the Chair of the Spina Bifida Association Professional Advisory Council (PAC). Dr. David Joseph a urologist, is chair of the research committee of the SBAA and on the Board of Directors for the Spina Bifida Foundation and their liaison to the PAC. Both physician leaders are on the UAB multi- disciplinary spina bifida team. Over the next three years, The Children's Hospital of Alabama Spina Bifida Clinic intends to enroll each consented patient into this study to maximize research potential. As well as work with the other selected sites to put the infrastructure in place to develop a national registry for spina bifida.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",

Currently, MD STARnet participants of Asian or Pacific Island descent make up only 1% of the study sample which is not representative of the national population. Adding Hawai'i and Guam as MD STARnet sites will increase the number of Asian and Pacific Island participants within the study population. Data gathered by project staff will characterize the complications and long term outcomes of individuals with DBMD who are geographically isolated and may face barriers such as lack of access to health care or information about the management of DBMD within protocol standards. In addition, the project will describe the history and outcome of individuals with DBMD who receive different levels of medical and preventative care. Finally, the culture of Hawai'i and Guam may provide insight into unique methods of caring for children and families with DBMD. The Hawai'i MD STARnet Project will follow the established protocols and procedures of the existing multistate MD STARnet Project. Project participants in Hawai'i and Guam will be recruited through partnerships with Department of Health Programs (Birth Defects, Children with Special Health Needs, and Early Intervention Services), Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), MDA clinics, Shriners' Hospital, neuromuscular clinics, genetics clinics, and other pediatric and neurological practices. After obtaining informed consent, data will be gathered by project staff via chart review, family interviews, and long term follow-up of participating families.  Hawai'i and Guam data will be de-identified and transferred to the central MD STARnet Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for data analysis and evaluation.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the great economic costs and traditionally poor outcomes among chronic temporomandibular joint and muscle disorder (TMJMD) patients, it has become important to treat patients in the acute state, in order to prevent these more chronic disability problems. This has been the goal of two past funded grant projects. Results of the initial project isolated risk factors that successfully predicted the development of chronicity, with a 91% accuracy rate. A statistical algorithm was developed which was used in the second project to screen out \"high-risk\" patients. These patients were then randomly assigned an early intervention or non-intervention group. One-year follow-up evaluations documented the treatment efficacy and cost effectiveness of early intervention. These results have major implications for effective early intervention and significant health-care cost savings for this prevalent pain and disability problem. For the present proposed project, we plan to implement this treatment program in order to evaluate its effectiveness in more community-based dental practices. This is in response to NIH\\'s request for the implementation of evidence-based treatment approaches, developed in controlled clinical settings, to the \"real world\" of diverse practices in the community. Acute TMJMD patients will be recruited from two community clinics. Based upon our \"risk\" screening algorithm, high-risk patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups (n=225/group): an early biobehavioral intervention or an attention-control group. It is hypothesized that the attention control \"high-risk\" patients will display more chronic TMJMD problems, relative to the \"high-risk\" early intervention patients, at one-year follow-up. Another aim of the project is to evaluate the potential utility of new technologies that will lead to even greater precision in detecting individual differences among TMJMD patients. Measures evaluated include chewing performance, cortisol levels, and other biopsychosocial outcomes. This represents the next step in comprehensively understanding brain-behavior patterns in TMJMD. Also, structural equation modeling methodology will be used. Such a multi-level, multi-systems approach has not been applied to better understand the biopsychosocial underpinnings of TMJMD. Results from this component of the project will greatly aid in stimulating future research leading to the better understanding of TMJMD, as well as better tailoring of prescribed treatment regimens. Project Narrative: Temporomandibular joint and muscle disorder (TMJMD) is a highly prevalent and costly public health problem in the United States, especially when it becomes chronic in nature. This study will further evaluate the treatment- and cost-effectiveness of an early biobehavioral intervention program for preventing chronic TMJMD. Moreover, this evidence-based program will be implemented in actual community-based dental practices to make it more accessible to the general population.

       " \"[unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed multi-center randomized clinical trial is to determine if non-surgical therapy for pregnant women with [periodontitis] reduces the incidence of preterm birth. As noted in the year 2000 Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health, preterm birth and low birth weight are the leading prenatal problems in the U.S. and it has been estimated that the annual costs associated with preterm birth total $5.4 billion. Despite significant efforts to prevent preterm birth, it remains a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Moreover, preterm birth is more likely to affect minority women who have disparities in health care. Human, animal, and bacteriologic studies have linked periodontal disease with preterm delivery and low birth weight and there are preliminary data indicating that periodontal therapy may reduce the incidence of preterm birth. After obtaining informed consent, this clinical trial will enroll [816 women] who are 13 to 16 weeks pregnant. Volunteers will be recruited from four populations in Minnesota, Mississippi, [Kentucky, and New York City (Harlem)] with high numbers of minorities and high rates of preterm birth. They will be randomly assigned to either a Test [n=408] or a Control [n=408] Group. Test Group subjects will receive non-surgical mechanical periodontal therapy. Control Group subjects will have periodontal therapy delayed until after delivery. All subjects will be monitored and treated as soon as possible if there is evidence of progressive periodontitis and all will receive essential dental care to restore caries and treat abscessed teeth. Maternal risk factors for preterm birth and/or intrauterine growth restriction will be used as covariates in the data analysis. Both Groups will be followed until delivery and the primary birth outcome variable will be gestational age at birth. [We will also document the effect of periodontal therapy on immune response, systemic markers of inflammation, periodontal infection and clinical periodontal measures.] If this study demonstrates that periodontal therapy has a positive effect in reducing preterm birth, it will have enormous public health implications in terms of neonatal mortality, morbidity and cost savings.  \",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies have confirmed that there is an association between maternal periodontal disease and pregnancy complications that result in premature delivery [e.g. gestational age (GA)<37 weeks: adjusted odds ratio 2.1(CI95%:1.12, 4.09)and OR=4.2 for GA<28 weeks (CI95%: 1.42,12.6)] and decreased fetal weight [e.g. among mothers with births of GA between 35-37 weeks, those with periodontal disease (4+ sites with 5+mm PD and 2+mm AL) have neonates that are 13.8% smaller (p=0.004). The deleterious effect of maternal periodontal infection on pregnancy is particularly pronounced among African Americans and may, in part, account for some of the disparities in the prevalence of these unfortunate complications. Not only does the presence of periodontal disease early in pregnancy confer risk, but the worsening of periodontal disease during pregnancy - a relatively frequent event (35.5% of 814 deliveries) appears to independently enhance the risk of fetal exposure to periodontal pathogens (as evidenced by fetal cord blood IgM antibody to maternal oral pathogens) and preterm birth (OR=5.0, CI95%:2.22,11.3). These data suggest that periodontal disease and its progression may represent an infectious and inflammatory exposure that could have serious deleterious effects during pregnancy. Scientifically, to determine whether periodontal disease is causally related to preterm delivery and confers any modifiable risk, it will be critical to demonstrate that treating periodontal disease in pregnant mothers results in a decreased incidence of preterm birth and growth restriction. It is our central hypothesis that mothers with periodontitis that receive periodontal treatment during the second trimester of pregnancy will experience a lower rate of preterm delivery and a higher mean birth weight of the premature infants. We propose to conduct a 5-year randomized, 2-armed, clinical trial completing 1800 mothers at 3 medical/dental centers (UNC/Duke, UAB & UTHSCSA) that combine both periodontal and Obstetrics/Gynecology clinical trial expertise. We propose to randomly assign 1800 pregnant mothers with periodontal disease to one of two treatment arms 1) scaling and root planning during the second trimester or 2) scaling and root planning post-partum. Biological samples will be collected and archived during the conduct of the study to enable future investigations that will seek to further elucidate the role of maternal oral and vaginal infections on pregnancy. We hypothesize that periodontal treatment during pregnancy will significantly reduce the incidence of preterm deliveries of GA<35 weeks and also enhance the mean weight of those of GA<37 weeks. The impetus for this study is further supported by results from a pilot study conducted at UAB that demonstrated that scaling and root planning reduced the rate of GA<35 weeks from 6.4% in the untreated group to 0.81%. This application entitled MOTOR (Maternal Oral Therapy to Reduce Obstetric Risk) includes 5 separate components: an administrative oversight project (UNC Dental School), 3 clinical trial performance sites (UNC Dental/Duke Medical, UAB Dental & Medical and UTHSCSA Dental & Medical) and a clinical trials data and statistical coordinating center (UNC Collaborative Studies Coordinating Center, School of Public Health).',\n",

The likelihood of success of this proposed team effort is predicated on the very relevant prior experience of the team in crucial areas, including Dr. DeRouen's experience as P.I. on an NIDCR-funded multicenter clinical trial and in developing model training programs jn clinical dental research, Dr. Berg's experience in recruiting and overseeing clinicians in industry-sponsored clinical trials, and the experience of Drs. Ferracane and Hilton in developing a Practice-based Research in Oral Health network of dentists in Oregon and Southwest Washington. An important collaborator is the Delta Dental,Data Analysis Center, through which data for pilot and observational studies based on Delta Dental insurance claims in the five state network region can be obtained. An organizational structure is proposed for shared oversight of the operation which includes the use of five regional coordinators spread across this large geographical region. An aggressive strategy of recruitment of Network practitioners is proposed that includes working with state dental associations, dental alumni associations, and especially with local dental study clubs. An educational program for participants will be offered that is based on the highly successful Summer Institute in Clinical Dental Research Methods. Besides the Executive and Protocol Review Committees and DSMB mandated by the RFA, also proposed to facilitate the operations of the Network are a Publications Committee, a Dental Insurance Liaison Committee, and an External Advisory Committee. This application is paired with one to become the Data Coordinating Center, also from the University of Washington, with Brian Leroux, Ph.D. as P.I. and other members of the Biometry Core as co-investigators. Given Dr. DeRouen's previous history in developing the Biometry Core, close collaboration and coordination between Network Chair and Coordinating Center is.assured.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable] The overall goal of the proposed research project is to establish the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the Pacific Northwest Dental Practice Based Research Network (PNW/DPBRN). Both the DCC and the PNW/DPBRN will be based at the University of Washington School of Dentistry. The DCC will build on the strengths of an existing Biostatistics group that has a successful long-term track record in biostatistical methodologic research and collaboration in clinical dental research, as well as the expertise and extensive experience of Axio Research, a Contract Research Organization nearby in downtown Seattle. In response to RFA-DE-05-006 issued by the NIDCR, the DCC will provide the scientific leadership in design and implementation of clinical research and the infrastructure needed for the conduct of multiple clinical trials and prospective observational studies to address important oral health care questions. Five specific aims will be achieved: 1) Establish the infrastructure and develop Standard Operating Procedures for the DCC; 2) Create a reliable and customizable Web portal for commincations throughout the Network; 3) Participate with the Network Chair in training programs; 4) Assist Network members and Network Chair investigators in the design and initiation of at least 20 research studies, and ensure that IRB approvals are obtained before any patients are enrolled; and 5) Provide all biostatistical support for the implementation of approximately 20 approved research studies, including the coordination of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. These specific aims will be achieved by a team of investigators with complementary sets of expertise and experience. The Director of the DCC will be Dr. Brian Leroux, who currently leads a large active Biostatistics group at the University of Washington School of Dentistry. Key roles will be played by Dr. Lloyd Mancl, in Biostatistics, Dr. Philippe Hujoel, in Epidemiology and Study Design, and Jeffrey Sherman, in Behavioral Science, all at the University of Washington. The Data Management and IT Support Unit will be led by Ms. Ruth McBride, who has extensive experience managing coordinating centers for major NIHsponsored clinical trials in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, as well as industry-sponsored trials in a variety of clinical disease areas. Together, these investigators have the necessary expertise and experience in all areas that are critical for the success of the Data Coordinating Center for support of clinical dental research in the Pacific Northwest Dental Practice Based Research Network  [unreadable]       [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Studies supervised by PEARL will test specific strategies for the prevention, management, and treatment of multiple oral conditions, augmenting the knowledge base for clinical decision-making. PEARL participants also will conduct anonymous chart reviews for collecting and disseminating data on disease and treatment trends and to obtain prevalence estimates of less common conditions. To achieve this aim, the PEARL Network has organized four interactive cores, each of which includes an EMMES staff member as an Assistant Director, and will focus on the performance of key functions: (1) a Recruitment, Retention, Operations Core (2) a Training and Certification Core (3) a Protocol Development Core (4) an Information Dissemination Core. As the PEARL Coordinating Center, The EMMES Corporation will provide statistical and epidemiologic expertise in study design, execution and reporting, establish a web-based data management/information dissemination system, insure an appropriate quality assurance program is implemented, sub-contract with the Biomedical Research Alliance of New York (BRANY) central IRB, and provide administrative support for DSMB meetings, medical monitoring and regulatory support as needed. The PEARL Network will benefit from key resources already established through NYUCD: (1) an on-site team of experienced investigators, communication experts, and a strong quality assurance group partnered with senior academic and industry advisors; (2) a highly supportive environment at the NYUCD, including the facilities and staff of the Bluestone Center  [unreadable] for Clinical Research, the Masters program in Clinical Research, excellent press access, award winning communications vehicles; and the Rosenthal Institute of Continuing Education; (3) a partnership with the Levin Group, the largest dental practice-management consulting firm; (4) practitioner partnerships reaching thousands of dentists  [unreadable] through the Academy of General Dentistry, MetLife, the Scottish Dental PBRN, Health Partners, and Kaiser Permanente; (5) collaborations with distinguished researchers; (6) an External Advisory Board of experienced members of medical and dental PBRNs; and (7) a web-based P-I application established by EMMES and NYUCD in May 2004 with over 150 interested dentists identified. In summary, the PEARL Network is uniquely positioned to establish and maintain a PBRN that will conduct research studies designed to positively impact oral health.

       " 'The long-term objective of this research is to characterize the cultivable and currently uncultivated microorganisms present in the human oral cavity (microbiome) and all of their genes (metagenome) in order to develop an integrated view of host-microbiome interactions in health and disease. The objectives of this project are to define the unnamed and uncultured oral taxa and to obtain broad metagenomic sequence information that is representative of the phylogenetic diversity of these microorganisms. Recent studies have identified almost 800 species in the oral cavity, of which 35% are named, 11% unnamed but represented by strains, and 54% are unnamed and known only as 16S rRNA sequence phylotypes. There is currently no naming scheme for the unnamed 65% of the microbiome, thus it is nearly impossible to link sequence, phenotypic, prevalence, disease association, and bibliographic information. Aim 1 will make it possible to link these important types of data by naming the unnamed phylotypes, and establishing a curated, Internet-accessible Human Oral Microbiome Database for all prokaryotic oral taxa. There are species from 121 genera in the oral cavity and only minimal genomic information exists for half of these genera. Aim 2 will obtain partial genome sequences for 105 phylogenetically diverse human oral bacteria. Genomic libraries for each species will be constructed and 384 clones will be sequenced from each end, yielding 10%-20% genome coverage for each species. This will add information on 600 genes and proteins for each species and over 60,000 new gene sequences to the oral metagenome. These phylogenetically diverse sequences will facilitate attribution of contigs to specific genera or species in other metagenome projects. Currently, 65% of oral prokaryotes are known only as phylotypes based on 16S rRNA sequences. Meaningful biological characterization requires having living organisms to manipulate on the bench. Aim 3 will identify and deposit reference strains of approximately 200 unnamed oral phylotypes. Strains from phenotypically characterized investigator culture collections will be identified by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and novel reference strains deposited with the American Type Culture Collection. This proposal will significantly enhance our understanding of the human microbiome and allow eventual understanding of its interaction with the host in oral health and disease. This proposal is in response to PA-04-131, Metagenomic Analyses of the Oral Microbiome. This research will help us to understand the several hundred bacteria that live in the human oral cavity and their genes. These bacteria can cause tooth decay, periodontal disease, and infections elsewhere in the body. Knowing more about these many bacteria will allow scientists to develop better methods for treating and preventing oral diseases.',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Risk factors for onset and persistence of TMD: Myogenous temporomandibular disorder (TMD), with or without arthralgia, ranks second only to headache as the clinical condition most likely to cause craniofacial pain and dysfunction in the U.S. population. During the last decade, a small number of epidemiological studies have attempted to quantify the incidence of TMD in populations of European heritage; however, no investigative team to date has undertaken a large-scale, hypothesis-driven, prospective study designed to identify biopsychosocial and genetic risk factors for the onset and persistence of this vexing pain disorder. We propose to conduct a comprehensive, prospective cohort study of the incidence of TMD in collaboration with an internationally recognized group of epidemiologists, pain researchers, and geneticists. Participants will be enrolled and followed prospectively at four research institutions and by our Data Coordinating Center (Battelle Memorial Institute). Our three goals are to: a) undertake a five-year, prospective cohort study of 3200 initially TMD-free individuals recruited from major ethnic and racial strata at four study sites, quantifying incidence rates of first-onset-TMD; b) undertake a case-control study by recruiting 200 people with chronically symptomatic TMD identified during cohort recruitment whose history of TMD precludes them from the prospective study; c) to identify in both groups the individual and joint effects of predictors of TMD risk using a conceptual, causal model for TMD that we have developed based our own studies and other published research. Our preliminary epidemiological findings have led to the central hypothesis that pain amplification and psychological factors, both of which are influenced by genetic variants, represent causal risk factors that influence TMD onset and persistence. The outcomes of our proposed study will identify the primary socio-demographic, clinical, biological, psychological, and genetic risk factors for TMD onset and persistence. In so doing, we will obtain important and novel information regarding the etiopathogenesis of TMD, which will assist with the development of evidenced based pharmacological and behavioral interventions for TMD.

The ultimate goal of the project is to create a universal platform for performing systemic diagnosis using saliva. The device will be fully integrated and self-contained. A saliva specimen will be loaded onto a disposable microfluidic card containing all the necessary components and reagents to process the sample and measure multiple clinically relevant analytes with an optical fiber microarray. The results will be read optically and reported both via a liquid crystal display and over a wireless network. Pulmonary diseases will be targeted including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema, cystic fibrosis, and acute pneumonia. Saliva samples from both diseased and control patients will be obtained and analyzed using a variety of fluorescent-based assays. The initial phase will be carried out in an outpatient clinic setting, where patients will be followed at regular intervals when stable and during exacerbations of their disease. Samples will be collected and analyzed at baseline and during clinically unstable conditions allowing analysis of change from baseline as well as single sample correlations with clinical status. To directly test our overall hypothesis that saliva contains substances that correlate with disease, we will also collect and analyze key representative respiratory secretions and compare these results with those obtained from salivary analysis. Analytes that correlate with disease will be selected and converted into bead-based sensors for use with optical fiber microarrays. Analytes to be examined will include DNA/RNA, proteins such as cytokines, and small molecules and ions. All sample preparation and pre-treatments will be incorporated onto a microfluidic cassette. The disposable cassette will be integrated with the sensor array, enabling many clinical parameters to be measured simultaneously. The array will be interrogated by a portable optical reader that will be designed and integrated with the microfluidic cassette and the optical fiber array. We will demonstrate efficacy of the system at the lab bench and later provide one Alpha and three Beta units to the clinical investigators for pilot studies and expanded field trials.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to detect and monitor disease states through totally non-invasive means has been an elusive goal for the diagnostic industry. While oral fluid (saliva) is readily available and completely non-invasive, its utility in clinical diagnostics has only recently been demonstrated. Our team at UCLA, and others, has shown that oral fluid harbors the same composition of disease biomarkers as serum, albeit in smaller quantities. The team has also demonstrated, as part of NlDCR\\'s \"Development of Technologies for Saliva/Oral Fluid Based Diagnostics\" program, a microfluidic-based micro/nano sensor (Oral Fluid MEMS/NEMS Chip [OFMNC]) for the ultrasensitive, ultraspecific detection of oral cancer biomarkers in saliva. This application includes three highly responsive Specific Aims. Aim 1 will develop the \"Oral Fluid NanoSensor Test (OFNASET)\" as a handheld and easy to use instrument (OFNASE-lNSTRUMENT) and associated microfluidic consumables (OFNASE-CARTRIDGE). This integrated system will enable the simultaneous and rapid detection of multiple salivary protein and nucleic acid targets. Aim 2 will analytically validate the OFNASET according to diagnostic-industry standards. Aim 3 will preliminarily demonstrate the clinical utility of OFNASET for clinical oral cancer screening. The proposed work will culminate with the design of a pre-market approval (PMA) clinical trial to be presented to the FDA in a pre-IDE meeting. Our vision is to improve patient care by speeding the commercialization of saliva-based diagnostics. We believe that our established strategic alliances with GeneFluidics (a leader in bionanotechnology and microfluidics) and Becton Dickinson (the world\\'s fifth largest clinical diagnostic company) will bridge the chasm between technology conceptualization and commercialization and make our vision a reality. For public: This proposal is to achieve the goal of develop, validate and achieve regulatory FDA approval of tools that can be used by dentists and doctors for in-office real time detection of oral cancer using a drop of saliva.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Saliva is an important diagnostic fluid that has the potential to be used for detection of essential biomarkers for both oral and systemic diseases. Unfortunately, the current lack of reliable detection methods for measurement of important analytes within this complex biomatrix has hindered progress in salivary diagnostics. To help remove this barrier, recent promising activities have been initiated in microfluidic-based Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) systems. While several miniaturized platforms are being developed now, few of these systems have evolved to the point where important protein biomarkers can be measured over the physiological range using real saliva samples. Towards this essential goal, the team of investigators from UT and UK have developed and documented carefully an integrated biochip assay system that is suitable for measurement of panels of important inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP, IL-1beta, MMP-8, TNF-alpha, IL-6) in saliva. This newly fashioned ultra-sensitive method has been used to extend saliva-based diagnostics to the low levels of CRP found in saliva, therefore allowing for the first comparison of CRP levels between healthy, periodontitis, and edentulous patients. The miniaturized system correlates nicely with established macroscopic \"gold standard\" methods. Thus, it now important to take the next steps to combine these functional components and associated methodologies so as to create a flexible platform system that may be used to promote and expand the field of salivary diagnostics. This U01 renewal program targets the development of portable devices that can be used to complete salivary diagnostic tests. The program will evolve with important biochip, analyzer and immunoassay development milestones to be completed in the first two years of the program. In year 1, integrated biochips and analyzers will be developed and tested. These alpha prototypes will be used to define specifications for more final systems. In year 2, fully developed biochips and analyzer suitable to serve, as beta prototypes will be fashioned. These highly functional portable systems will be used in years 3-5 to complete pre-clinical testing and validation.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are developing a portable, credit-card sized microfluidic lab-on-a-chip for rapid point-of-care detection of multiple bacterial and viral targets using oral fluids. In the initial phase of this study we have evaluated a number of oral fluid collectors, and selected one; designed and evaluated 5 types of miniature PCR devices, and selected one; designed and tested several types of valves, and will progress with two, and assessed a variety of means of moving fluids through the chip and focused on two methods. The detection system utilizes Up-converting phosphor Technology (UPT) and an existing reader. Our initial work focused on HIV (an RNA virus) and B. cereus (a DNA bacterium) to establish proof of principle. The technology involves modular components, and can be modified to detect a wide variety of bacteria and viruses, as well as antibodies to those pathogens. In this renewal, we will continue development of an HIV point-of-care device that monitors viral antigen, nucleic acid, and anti-HIV antibodies. Our bacterial studies will be extended to S. pyogenes, the major organism responsible for strep throat, selected since its high prevalence facilitates clinical evaluation. We will develop and optimize a prototype portable device capable of simultaneously detecting bacterial and viral targets within 2 years, and anticipate having a system ready for full FDA compliant clinical trials in 5 years. The research/development plan presented in this proposal will (1) continue to design, test, and optimize the microfluidic chip and processing unit; (2) carry out clinical studies with banked oral and serum samples from HIV+ and HIV- women (WIHS) and oral swabs from S. pyogenes + and - individuals to assess the robustness, specificity, reproducibility and limits of detection of this device; (3) assess several approaches to enhance sensitivity, decrease analysis time, and lead to a second generation device; and (4) perform assay verification and develop a complete product development plan including a design control program. It is important to note that while the plan focuses on HIV and S. pyogenes in oral samples, the platform can easily be converted to look at other types of samples (blood, nasopharyngeal and oral swabs, urine), and other pathogens including emerging infectious agents such as avian H5N1 virus.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clefts of the lip and palate (CLP) comprise a large fraction of human birth defects, and are associated with a range of health complications. They require surgical, dental, speech, medical and behavioral interventions and impose a substantial economic and societal burden. CLP is the most prevalent birth defect in the United States, with about 6,800 new cases which includes cleft lip and/or palate, isolated and non-isolated born each year. There is a well documented, safe and inexpensive prevention for a related birth defect - those of the neural tube (NTD). Folic acid supplementation prior to pregnancy and during the first trimester shows that 4 mg per day will decrease NTD recurrence risks by about 70%. A few studies have also suggested decreased risks of recurrence of oral clefts with folic acid but these studies suffer from serious design limitations, and the real effect of folic acid on CLP recurrence remains to be demonstrated. It is critical to conduct a robust, large-scale, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial that clearly addresses this question. In this project we will complete the evaluation of the effect on prevention of CLP recurrence of periconceptual supplementation with high dose folic acid (4 mg) versus low dose (0.4 mg). We initiated this study five years ago under the sponsorship of the NIDCR, NICHD and the Gates Foundation. This proposal is to complete the current study by using the existing research infrastructure. We will continue involvement of the best participant sites, our pharmaceutical partner for inexpensive folate supplements and our experienced clinical trials partner, RTI, for data management. The primary aim is to assess the effect of folic acid supplementation of 4 mg/day on reducing the recurrence of CLP with power of 0.80 to see a 50% reduction under conservative assumptions. Secondary aims include comparing the effects of the two folic acid doses on health outcomes including serum and red cell folate levels; severity of CLP in offspring of trial mothers; rates of miscarriages and other birth defects; and effects on birth weight and gestational age. Under separate funding we will also examine the role of genes involved in folate metabolism on folate, B12 and homocysteine levels. This project addresses a fundamental challenge in the clinical care of families with one or more individuals with a cleft; that is, how to manage recurrence prevention. There are currently an estimated 1,000 births a year of children with clefts coming from high risk families in the US. If we were to realize a 50% reduction in CLP in these families, in the US alone, we would decrease the personal burden on each individual child and family and save $100 million in cleft-related economic costs per year.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Isolated cleft palate is the commonest craniofacial birth anomaly (e.g., 4.5 per 10,000 births in the US). It creates problems in feeding, speech, hearing, and dental development. Unsuccessful surgery may fail to resolve these problems and reduce the child's potential for social development and inclusion. At this time there is an inadequate evidence base for selecting the optimal timing for surgery. There is however a plausible case for undertaking surgery at 6 months, rather than the more usual timing of 12 months, as the provision of a functioning palate when speech skills begin to develop may lead to better speech outcomes. A randomized control trial will be undertaken to compare the outcomes of surgery performed either at age 6 months or at age 12 months. All infants will receive the same type of palate surgery. Approximately 650 infants will be enrolled and followed until age 5 years. The key inclusion variables are that they have non-syndromic cleft palate, they have been independently judged to be medically fit for surgery, and their parents consent to participation. The main outcome will be insufficient velopharyngeal function assessed by blinded judges. Secondary outcomes will be surgical complications, articulation, hearing, and dentofacial development. Recruitment will take 3 years. The findings will be applicable to children with cleft palate in any part of the world. The clinical sites will be members of an international consortium of cleft centers who recently completed enrollment of 925 infants into large scale trials of unilateral cleft lip and palate sponsored by the European Commission and NIDCR: the Scandcleft Network (10 surgical sites serving all of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden and five regional centers in the UK); and a large specialized cleft center in Brazil (USP-HRAC, Bauru). Project Narrative: Improving the evidence base for cleft palate surgery will improve the treatment and social integration of affected children, reduce the burden of remedial care that they and their families must endure, and reduce the cost of care associated with cleft palate.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dental caries (also known as tooth decay) remains the most common chronic disease of childhood. Although overall caries prevalence has declined over the last 40 years, dental caries in the primary dentition and mean caries rates in children ages 2-11 has increased markedly over the past 12 years. Childhood caries is a serious public health issue because of associated health problems and because disparities in oral health have led to substantially higher average disease prevalence among children in poverty and in underserved racial and ethnic groups. These issues are of such concern that in 2005, the American Academy of Pediatrics made children\\'s oral health one of their top areas of focus, as it is for the majority of the NIDCR \"Disparities Centers.\" Multiple factors contribute to a person\\'s risk for caries, including environmental factors such as diet, oral hygiene, fluoride exposure and the level of colonization of cariogenic bacteria and host factors such as salivary flow. There are still individuals who appear to be more susceptible to caries and those that are extremely resistant, regardless of the environmental risk factors to which they are exposed, implying that genetic factors also play an important role in caries etiology. This conclusion is supported by studies in both humans and animals, with the most compelling evidence coming from studies of twins reared apart in which investigators found significant resemblance within monozygotic (MZ) but not dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs for percentage of teeth and surfaces restored or carious and estimated the genetic contribution to caries as 40%. Despite the strong evidence of a genetic component to risk for dental caries, there have been only a few studies of candidate genes in caries, and no published genome-wide scans. Therefore, the goal of this study is to perform genome-wide association (GWA) studies of dental caries with a large panel of SNPs (500,000 or more) in families and individuals ascertained through multiple US sites. There will be an initial GWA scan in samples from three sites (University of Pittsburgh, University of Iowa, and University of Washington), with follow-up studies in additional collaborating sites (University of Michigan and UCSF). Successful completion of this study will allow a better understanding of the biology of dental caries, and will lead to earlier identification of children at risk for dental caries, thereby allowing improved and targeted interventions.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of the proposed Community Oral Health Interventions Program (COHIP) is to develop and implement an integrated model for reducing oral health disparities. COHIP's vision, mission, and design framework were developed with direct input from community partners and the findings for the Detroit Dental Health Project (DDHP), a disparity research center funded by NIH. The DDHP has had a successful model for understanding the determinants of oral health disparities and has built a strong community and organizational foundations. The DDHP has produced so far over 19 refereed publications, 3 PhD dissertations, and 2 MSc theses. Moreover, the DDHP core leadership has managed during the last 6 years a complex research project focusing on families of low-income African-American children. The findings from the DDHP underscore the need for multi-level interventions. Following the Ottawa and Jakarta Declarations for health promotion, COHIP was designed to intervene on key social, behavioral, and clinical factors of oral health disparities. The COHIP will focus on building healthy communities around four dental clinics owned by 2 Federally Qualified Health Centers. Around each clinic the lowest income census tracts will be selected to target a population of 16,023 children aged 0-11 years and their caregivers. The selected areas will be stratified into small clusters of households and randomized into intervention and comparison groups. COHIP includes three clustered randomized demonstration trials targeting the same families. One project will aim to intervene on the social, behavioral, and biological determinants of dental caries; another will focus on resolving a major problem identified in the DDHP analyses where children who get care have a significant proportion of their cavitated tooth surfaces left untreated within 2 years of follow-up; and the third will focus on reducing the significant disparities in periodontal diseases on adults by intervening on the social, behavioral, and biological risk factors of periodontal diseases. COHIP has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of social, behavioral, biological, dental, medical and organizational researchers. COHIP plans to intervene at the community and clinical levels. Sustainability of the COHIP model is a requirement demanded by the community partners.

This document describes the administrative center, overall design, management and structure of COHIP. It also describes the research training program.  COHIP proposes to develop and implememt a sustainable healthy community model which integrates community-based oral health promotion programs, provided by culturally competent community health teams, with evidence-based clinical and preventive care provided by dental clinicians working in four Federally Qualified Health Centers' (FQHCs) dental clinics (COHIP clinics) in Detroit (Eastside, Nolan, Bruce Douglas, and Thea Bowman). The primary interveners in the COHIP model will be community health workers (CHWs) who will be trained by local and national team of experts. The CHWs will be trained to advcoate for the families of children aged 0-11 years and their caregivers living in low-income areas, coordinate their dental care, provide motivational interventions to reduce dental anxiety and fatalism, develop preventive plans, manage diabetes, improve their oral hygiene practices, increase nutritional literacy, and promote tobacco cessation. The CHWs will provide formal social support and will follow-up with the families on regular basis. To develop these interventions COHIP has teams of experts in social interventions, motivational interviewing, diabetes education, clinical care, oral health and health litearcy; in addition to teams of statistical experts and managers of research projects. COHIP will collaborate and share resoucres with the University of Michigan Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) and the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research at the School of Medicine.  COHIP will recruit 1,510 famiilies with eligible children living in 27 census tracts around the four clinics. The families reside in randomly selected segments within these tracts. The segments will be assigned into either an intervention or comparison arms. The families in the comparison areas will by visited by trained research staff (not CHWs) and be provided with information on dental care but not scheduled by the staff to visit the clinics. They will also not receive any social or behavioral interventions at their homes. They will be treated by the regular dental providers at the clinics who will follow their existing standards of care. For the families in the intervenion areas, the CHWs will provide integrated motivational interventions as described above. These families will be cared for by a COHIP-hired clinical team that will work in the 4 FQHC clinics. The team will follow new protocols for diagnosis, risk assessment, restorative/surgical care and provide evidence-based preventive care based on risk status of each participant.  COHIP management is comprised of an experienced team with extensive field experience in coordinating complex community-based interventions as well as observational studies. The team has experience in recruitment, data collection, analysis, and publications in the current funded disparity center. COHIP will target 11 clinically meaningful outcomes to reduce health disparities in children and adult caregivers.  COHIP research training program will target students from the middle school level until the doctoral level and will be based on the CTSA program as well as those offered by the School of Public Health.  COHIP as model has received strong support from the regional office of the Health and Resources Services Administration, the National Network for Oral Health Access (NNOHA), and it has generated an interest among researchers from the Schools of Medicine and Pubic Health, the Institute for Social Research, and several other local, national, and international organizations. The COHIP model can be leveraged to address other health disparities and it can be financially sustainable based on the recruitment of Medicaid eligible families to receive dental care at Federally Qualified Health Centers.  Finally, as endorsement and trust that the University of Michigan has in the proposed program, a $1 Million gift will be awared to COHIP to fund its programs and support its mission. The COHIP team brings a wealth of expertise and knowledge to develop and implement programs to significantly reduce or eliminate the burden of oral health inequalities.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Diabetes Prevention Program is a multicenter controlled clinical trial examining the efficacy of an intensive life-style intervention or metformin to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in a population selected to be at high risk due to the presence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Development of diabetes, defined by 1997 ADA criteria, is the primary outcome while cardiovascular disease and its risk factors are important secondary outcomes. The DPP began recruitment in mid-1996. At the time of this application, total study exposure is a mean of approximately 3 years (range 2 to 5) with a total of approximately 10,000 patient years in the 3,234 volunteers in the 3-arm study. On the basis of a statistically significant and clinically compelling decrease in the development of diabetes in the life-style intervention and metformin-treated groups (58% and 31% reductions, respectively) compared with the placebo treated group, the DPP Data Monitoring Board and NIDDK ended the masked treatment phase of the study in May, 2001, one year earlier than originally planned. This application is designed to take further advantage of the scientifically and clinically valuable cohort of DPP volunteers and the large volume of data collected during the study. The highly compliant DPP cohort, including 45% minorities, is the largest IGT population ever studied. Moreover, the subcohort that has developed diabetes (n approximately 700) has been followed from near the exact time of diabetes onset. Clinically important research questions remain in the wake of the DPP. The carefully collected, centrally measured and graded data in this cohort should help to answer, definitively, a number of important questions regarding the clinical course of IGT and early onset type 2 diabetes. Specific aims include: 1. Examine the long-term effects and durability of prior DPP intervention on the major DPP outcomes including diabetes, clinical cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, CVD risk factors,quality of life and cost-benefit; 2. Determine the clinical course of new onset type 2 diabetes and IGT, in particular regarding microvascular and neurologic complications; 3. Determine the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk factors and atherosclerosis in new onset type 2 diabetes and IGT; and 4. Examine topics 1-3 in minority populations, men vs. women, and in older subjects in the DPP. The current application is for 5 years of funding, although the some of the goals of the projects described will require a 10-year study.',\n",

This analysis will be epidemiologic in nature with all groups being pooled with prior treatment being used as a co-variate. Finally, the same data will be used to examine the effects of gender, age, and race/ethnicity on diabetes and its vascular complication.',\n",

Determine the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk factors and atherosclerosis in new onset type 2 diabetes and IGT; and 4.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Diabetes Prevention Program is a multicenter controlled clinical trial examining the efficacy of an intensive life-style intervention or metformin to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in a population selected to be at high risk due to the presence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Development of diabetes, defined by 1997 ADA criteria, is the primary outcome while cardiovascular disease and its risk factors are important secondary outcomes. The DPP began recruitment in mid-1996. At the time of this application, total study exposure is a mean of approximately 3 years (range 2 to 5) with a total of approximately 10,000 patient years in the 3,234 volunteers in the 3-arm study. On the basis of a statistically significant and clinically compelling decrease in the development of diabetes in the life-style intervention and metformin-treated groups (58% and 31% reductions, respectively) compared with the placebo treated group, the DPP Data Monitoring Board and NIDDK ended the masked treatment phase of the study in May, 2001, one year earlier than originally planned. This application is designed to take further advantage of the scientifically and clinically valuable cohort of DPP volunteers and the large volume of data collected during the study. The highly compliant DPP cohort, including 45% minorities, is the largest IGT population ever studied. Moreover, the subcohort that has developed diabetes (n approximately 700) has been followed from near the exact time of diabetes onset. Clinically important research questions remain in the wake of the DPP. The carefully collected, centrally measured and graded data in this cohort should help to answer, definitively, a number of important questions regarding the clinical course of IGT and early onset type 2 diabetes.

       " 'Hypertensive kidney disease commonly progresses. The primary objective of the AASK (African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension) Cohort Study is to determine prospectively the course of kidney function and risk factors for kidney disease progression in African-Americans with hypertensive kidney disease who receive recommended antihypertensive therapy. A secondary objective is to determine the occurrence of cardiovascular disease and assess its risk factors. The AASK Cohort Study is a prospective, observational study that is an extension of the AASK trial. The AASK trial tested the effects of 3 medications used as initial antihypertensive therapy (ramipril, metoprolol and amlodipine) and 2 levels of blood pressure control. Of the 1,094 trial participants, approximately 650 to 700 individuals who have not reached end stage renal disease (ESRD) will likely enroll in the Cohort Study. Risk factors to be studied include environmental, genetic, physiologic, and socio-economic variables. The primary renal outcome is a composite clinical outcome defined by doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD, or death. Medication treatment for hypertension, beginning with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, is offered to all participants. In this fashion, the study directly controls two of the major determinants of kidney disease progression (treatment of hypertension and use of reno-protective, antihypertensive medication). The minimum duration of follow-up in the Cohort Study is 5 years (total of 9 to 12 years, including the period of the AASK trial). Ultimately, data from the AASK Cohort Study should enhance our understanding of the risk factors and processes that determine the progression of kidney disease. Such results might eventually lead to new strategies that delay or prevent ESRD.',\n",

       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Boston Area Community Health (BACH) study is filling knowledge gaps in the epidemiology of urologic problems - especially variations in prevalence and risk factors by race/ethnicity, gender, age, and socioeconomic status. A random population sample of 5,506 adults (3,205 females, 2,301 males;1,770 Black, 1,877 Hispanic, 1,859 White) was successfully recruited (2002-2005). A 2-hour in-person interview obtained information on urologic symptoms, sociodemographics, measured anthropometries, health status and pharmaceutical usage (both prescribed and OTC), lifestyles and psychosocial factors, and health care utilization. A venous blood sample (20 ml) was obtained from a majority (70%) of subjects. Paper topics were identified and prioritized by a Scientific Advisory Committee: 43 posters and abstracts have been presented at national and international meetings;6 peer-reviewed papers have appeared/been accepted;13 submitted and under review;8 are in active development;59 topics have been identified for future papers.       We propose to transition BACH from a cross-sectional to a prospective cohort design: efforts to remain in contact with subjects and a recent (2006) highly successful attempt to re-interview 500 subjects (after 4+ years) show that over 80% (n=4.130) can be re-recruited. Prospective follow-up of well-characterized subjects provides an opportunity to address questions concerning the epidemiology of urological symptoms: natural history (progression/remission) within the same subject, longitudinal relationship with major chronic diseases, pharmacoepidemiology, the role of life experiences/events, help-seeking behavior, and formal and informal costs (bother, distress and quality of life). It will provide much needed incidence rates, an opportunity to test the robustness of baseline associations, and help unravel pathophysiologic pathways. Interviews will continue to be conducted in-person (often using the same baseline interviewer) to avoid variations due to different data gathering modes. Analyses of the baseline data have informed many novel longitudinal questions.      Unique features of BACH include:  a random community-based sample;       inclusion of race/ethnic minorities; sufficient numbers of both males and females; the broad age-span of 30-80 years; its focus on symptoms (rather than ill-defined conditions); use of validated field instruments; its multidisciplinary orientation; its representativeness and generalizabilitv; the ready availability of biologic specimens;and the efforts to remain in current contact with all BACH subjects.      This study will examine the \"urologic iceberg\" - the incidence of urologic symptoms in the population, risk factors, changes over time, impact on quality of life, use of health care, and the emerging burden of symptoms suggestive of urologic disease.

       " 'Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a major cause of disabling morbidity and is the fourth leading cause of end-stage renal failure in the world, affecting more than 500,000 U.S. citizens and millions more worldwide. Researchers at the University of Alabama, Emory University, University of Kansas, Mayo Clinic and Washington University St. Louis joined together in 2000 to create the Consortium for Radiologic Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISPI). The primary objectives of this investigation were to: (1) to develop and test the accuracy and reproducibility of imaging techniques to monitor changes in renal cyst size and parenchymal involvement, (2) to establish and maintain a database of uniformly and accurately collected information, and (3) to maintain and make available such data to facilitate the planning and implementation of clinically appropriate interventions in the near future. The goals of CRISPII are to extend the observations of CRISPI in order to: 1) draw unequivocal linkage between the rate of kidney/cyst enlargement and qualitative and quantitative end-points; 2) to provide a marker of disease progression (kidney volume) sensitive and accurate enough to be used as a primary outcome marker in clinical trials aiming to forestall disease progression; 3) to develop and test other biomarkers of disease progression. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Extend the preliminary observations of CRISPI to ascertain the extent to which quantitative (kidney volume and hepatic and kidney cyst volume) or qualitative (cyst distribution and character) structural parameters predict renal insufficiency. Aim 2: Extend the preliminary observations of CRISPI to ascertain the extent to which age and sex-adjusted measurements of renal blood flow by MR technology predict the rate of renal growth; and, renal blood flow and kidney volume predict the rate of renal function decline in ADPKD. Aim 3: Exhaustively analyze the living database and stored biologic samples derived from CRISPI and the CRISPII extension to develop and test new metrics to quantify and monitor disease progression. Extend the analysis of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) excretion to determine if absolute levels of urinary MCP-1 excretion and changes in the rates of excretion bear relation to specific morbid events (e.g. gross hematuria, new onset hypertension urinary tract infection, renal stone, nonspecific renal pain, and worsening renal function (declining GFR or increased albuminuria).',\n",

(3) Maintain and make available such data to facilitate the planning and implementation of clinically appropriate interventions in the near future. The goals of CRISP-I I are to extend the observations of CRISPI in order to: 1) Draw unequivocal linkage between the rate of kidney/cyst enlargement and qualitative and quantitative end-points. 2) Provide a marker of disease progression (kidney volume) sensitive and accurate enough to be used as a primary outcome marker in clinical trials aiming to forestall disease progression. 3) Develop and test other bio-markers of disease progression. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Extend the preliminary observations of CRISP-I to ascertain the extent to which quantitative (kidney volume and hepatic and kidney cyst volume) or qualitative (cyst distribution and character) structural parameters predict renal insufficiency. Aim 2: Extend the preliminary observations of CRISP-I to ascertain the extent to which age and sex-adjusted measurements of renal blood flow by MR technology predict the rate of renal growth; and, renal blood flow and kidney volume predict the rate of renal function decline in ADPKD. Aim 3: Exhaustively analyze the living database and stored biologic samples derived from CRISP-I and the CRISP-II extension to develop and test new metrics to quantify and monitor disease progression, and collect DMA samples and clinical information from CRISP family members known to have ADPKD for use in future studies to examine genotype-phenotype correlations and to identify genetic modifiers.

Participants are randomized to an intensive lifestyle intervention designed to achieve and maintain weight loss by decreased caloric intake and increased physical activity, or to a control program of diabetes support and education. The primary outcome of Look AHEAD is the aggregate occurrence of severe cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal Ml and stroke and cardiovascular deaths) over a planed follow-up of 11.5 years. The original grant application provided funding for the first 7 years of the study (1 year for study design and 6 for execution of the trial). The present grant application is for an additional 7 years of funding to complete the Look AHEAD trial. All aspects of the study have proceeded extremely well - the sample of 5,145 was recruited on time; retention has been excellent and the intervention has been effective in producing initial weight loss and maintaining it over time. All 16 clinical sites have been successful in recruitment, retention, and delivery of the intervention and the DSMB has been very positive about the execution of the trial. The present application reviews the overall design of Look AHEAD, progress to date, and plans for the future. Specific Aims are to retain the cohort over time, continue to complete annual in-person visits and semi-annual telephone interviews for outcome assessments and continue to administer the lifestyle intervention. These procedures will enable us to analyze the effects of the intervention on serious cardiovascular- related factors and complications, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Pressure to improve the quality and lower the cost of health care has created the need to understand the effectiveness of medical interventions in clinical practice settings. Endoscopy plays an n important role in the diagnosis and management of digestive diseases. Despite widespread use of endoscopy, little is known about outcomes in community-based settings. We developed a practice-based consortium to study endoscopic outcomes. Practice sites utilize a computerized endoscopic report generator to produce endoscopy reports, while simultaneously creating a data file. De-identified endoscopy data is transmitted electronically from sites to a central data repository for data analysis. Quality control measures ensure data integrity and accuracy. The practice consortium now includes 648 physicians in 68 adult, and 11 pediatric practice sites in 28 states. Of all adult endoscopy results, 65 % come from non-academic settings. We have demonstrated successful completion of prospective research projects. In the current proposal, we will build on the foundation of our clinical practice network, to conduct research, which will improve the quality of clinical practice in gastroenterology. The specific themes of this proposal are: Theme 1: Analysis of practice. We will conduct prospective analysis of endoscopic utilization, measure endoscopic findings and complications, practice variation, and identify association, which predict likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes. Theme 2: Translation of research into practice. We will conduct research projects to translate new information about endoscopic outcomes into clinical practice. The consortium provides a unique opportunity to determine hoe new discovery impacts practice. Theme 3: Prospective research. Prospective research will focus on areas of clinical practice that lack critical evidence of effectiveness. We have developed methods for collection of prospective data in the flow of practice, following patient outcomes over time, and measuring changes in practice over time. Theme 4: Provide a resource to the scientific community. We have demonstrated successful collaboration with a wide range of clinical investigators to develop projects that are uniquely suited to a large community-based practice network.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is undoubtedly a multifactoral disease, and a large proportion of patients affected with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes develop diabetic nephropathy and progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD). When poor prognostic factors such as hypertension and chronic hyperglycemia are aggressively treated, the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy can be slowed. However, no interventions have been shown to reliably halt the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Numerous studies have suggested that genetic predisposition to diabetic nephropathy exists, but genes for nephropathy have not yet been isolated. It is anticipated that a comprehensive analysis of a large number of uniformly phenotyped ESRD families will be necessary to isolated genes for ESRD. Such a database of families may not be available at any single institution. The FIND study has established a centralized Genetic Analysis and Data Coordinating Center (GADCC) that, together with eight participating investigation centers (PICs), three minority recruitment centers, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), will use the emerging high-throughput genetic technologies to enable identification of diabetic nephropathy susceptibility or protection genes. The charge of the consortium is to acquire sets of families with well-characterized diabetic nephropathy, establish a secure master FIND database, and perform a genome scan to identify chromosomal regions linked with diabetic nephropathy      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

The investigators propose to conduct the TOMUS trial as well as continue the observational follow-up studies for the SISTEr and BE-DRI studies (i.e. E-SISTEr and E-BE-DRI). The Primary Aims of TOMUS are to compare objective and subjective cure rates for stress incontinence at 12 and 24 months between the retropubic and transobturator midurethral sling (MUS) procedures. The retropubic approach is generally accepted as the gold standard of MUS procedures. The transobturator approach avoids the retropubic space and offers the theoretical advantage of reduced vascular and enteric injury associated with the original retropubic approach. The transobturator technique has been quickly adopted by surgeons despite the absence of data on safety and efficacy. This study will compare the efficacy and safety of the retropubic and transobturator (inside-out and outside-in) procedures in a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT). 588 women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) will be enrolled; 65 of these women will be from Pittsburgh. The investigators at UPITT also commit to collecting long-term outcome data from 46 local SISTEr trial enrollees consented in the 'Extended SISTEr' study (E-SISTEr), which aims to compare long-term effectiveness and durability (5 years) of the Burch colposuspension and autologous fascial sling for treatment of SUI in a randomized cohort of 655 women. In addition, we will contribute 32 enrolled subjects into the 'Extended BE-DRI (E-BE- DRI) study which will examine long-term durability (26 months) of the addition of behavioral treatment to drug therapy for urge urinary incontinence (UUI) in a randomized cohort of 307 women. For all studies, the CC is responsible for patient enrollment and follow-up, treatment, and data collection and management. The mission and purpose of the UITN is to establish a group of collaborating investigators who will conduct long- term studies, including clinical trials, of the most commonly used surgical, pharmacological and behavioral approaches to the management of urinary incontinence in women. The investigators from UPITT, supported by their experienced research staff, are poised to continue to contribute to these network activities, including protocol development, standing committees and work groups, manuscripts and presentations.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): OVERVIEW OF PROPOSAL This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-DK-06-501 for continuation of the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN). Phase II of the UITN will include continued conduct of the TOMUS trial as well as continuation of the observational follow-up studies for the SISTEr and BE-DRI studies (called E-SISTEr and E-BE-DRI) conducted in Phase I. Because the primary effort of Phase II will be directed toward conduct of the TOMUS trial, this proposal describes in detail the scientific rationale for and the conduct of this trial. The protocol for this trial was developed in response to a request from NIDDK in mid-2004 for development of a third study to be conducted by the UITN. The protocol was subsequently reviewed in May 2005 by an Ad Hoc Advisory Committee constituted by the NIDDK and then by the UITN DSMB in the fall of 2005. At each point of review, recommendations by the respective committees were considered carefully by the UITN investigators and revisions to the protocol were made where considered indicated and appropriate. The UITN DSMB approved the protocol in February 2006 and recruitment for the trial will start in late March 2006. This proposal also describes the Study Aims and methods for the E-SISTEr and E-BE-DRI studies (section D.7). The full protocols, including a description of the Study Aims, designs and methods for the SISTEr and BE-DRI studies are included in Appendix B.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Phase II will focus on conduct of the TOMUS trial as well as continuation of the observational follow-up studies for the SISTEr and BE-DRI studies (i.e. E-SISTEr and E-BE-DRI) of Phase I. Primary Aims of TOMUS are to compare objective and subjective cure rates for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) at 12 and 24 months between the retropubic and transobturator midurethral sling procedures.The retropubic approach, with the longest history and most available data on efficacy and safety of all MUS procedures, is generally accepted as the gold standard. The transobturator approach stays out of the retropubic space and offers the most potential for improving the rare but significant risks associated with the original retorpubic procedure. Use of these procedures is increasing rapidly with limited data available on safety and efficacy. Therefore, this study will compare the efficacy and safety of the retropubic and transobturator (inside-out and outside-in) procedures in a 2-arm RCT. 588 women with SUI will be enrolled; 65 patients at this CC. Primary Aim of E-SISTEr is to compare long-term effectiveness and durability (60 mos) of the Burch colposuspension and autologous fascial sling for treatment of SUI in a randomized cohort of 655 women; 42 are currently enrolled at this CC (with additional 18 possible). Primary Aim of E-BE-DRI is to examine long-term durability (26 mos) of the addition of behavioral treatment to drug therapy for treatment of urge incontinence in a randomized cohort of 307 women; 50 are enrolled at this CC. For all studies, the CC is responsible for patient enrollment and follow-up, treatment, data collection and management. CC investigators participate in network activities, including protocol development, standing committees and work groups, manuscripts and presentations. The PI at this CC is Co-Chairman of the BEDRI Study, conducted centralized training for BEDRI and TOMUS, took the lead role on BEDRI Design and Race/Ethnicity Impact Manuscripts, was responsible for enrolling over 50% of the Hispanics within the entire UITN.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] The Acute Liver Failure Study Group is now in its 7th year of operation, the final year of its current funding. A prospective registry program comprising 24 adult and 24 pediatric sites has collected detailed data, serum, tissue and DNA on more than 750 adults and 300 children with well-defined acute liver failure. Studies by the group have described the overall impact of various disease categories in acute liver failure, in particular that of acetaminophen, the role of viruses and acetaminophen in indeterminate cases, the impact of transplantation and sepsis in determining outcome, and the importance of prognostic factors for survival. The three specific aims of the original study have largely been met or exceeded. More than 30 ancillary studies have been performed using the data and biological materials available; 12 original articles have been published. A therapeutic trial of N-acetylcysteine for patients with acute liver failure not due to acetaminophen has exceeded 50% enrollment, with results still blinded at this time. We anticipate finishing the trial in the next 2-3 years with the addition of international sites. The present competing continuation proposal would extend the data, serum, tissue and DNA registry as an available resource for the next 5 years, and take our study of acute liver failure to a new level. Our new aims are to internationalize the study to provide global information from 8-10 sentinel sites on all continents, and to explore in more detailed fashion certain aspects of ALF: psychosocial aspects of acetaminophen toxicity, drug-induced liver injury pathogenesis focused on genetic polymorphisms and intensive care management and liver transplantation. A final aim is to provide the logistical support for new therapy initiatives, even while the MAC study is being completed. Using a wider, global network will provide surveillance against new infectious or toxic agents worldwide, facilitate more detailed studies in certain areas and permit faster accrual of new patients for future therapeutic trials in this rare but frequently fatal condition.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Renal transplant loss due to chronic allograft nephropathy, recently designated as interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy not otherwise specified (IF/TA NOS), is widely acknowledged as a major problem that has increased in relative importance as the incidence of early graft loss from acute rejection declined. Histological IF/TA, regardless of the cause, is almost universally present in the allograft within a few months of transplantation. Currently, there are no therapeutic options once the clinical manifestations of IF/TA have developed. Measures not focused on altering immunosuppressants to prevent IF/TA NOS have not been tested. This application requests continued support for an ongoing renal biopsy based randomized controlled trial that has successfully completed recruitment. This study, initiated with NIH support and recipient of continued DSMB approval will complete the exit phase during the 5 years of this proposal. This trial, Angiotensin II Blockade for Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (ABCAN), will determine whether angiotensin II receptor blockade can, in the first 5 post-kidney transplant years, prevent cortical interstitial volume expansion (an accurate predictor of long term graft function) and graft loss from biopsy proven IF/TA particularly its major cause; IF/TA NOS. The ongoing studies will characterize the interstitial ultrastructural compositional changes that occur in renal allografts with IF/TA, the effects of treatment on these changes and will also provide descriptors of the incidence and predictors of the development of IF/TA. We will also determine the impact of angiotensin II receptor blockade on the rate of GFR decline, the incidence and progression of post transplant proteinuria and the nature of the permselectivity defects responsible for the proteinuria. The ancillary studies will also describe the natural history of IF/TA and elucidate early markers and predictors of this important disorder. Lastly, we will have acquired a rich repository of urine, serum, DNA and renal tissue that can be shared with other investigators in the scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic allograft nephropathy continues to be a major cause of kidney transplant loss and return to dialysis. Treatment options are limited and the course of the disease tends to be progressive. This trial is designed to prevent a major mediator of this process, namely the expansion of the cortical interstitial compartment of the kidney where most of the scarring occurs. The drug being studied, Losartan, has proven efficacious in a number of kidney diseases.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " 'The number of Americans who suffer from mild-to-moderate chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) is estimated to be over 10 million and growing. However, remarkably little is known about the epidemiology, care, and outcomes of patients with CRI. Furthermore, the predictors of progression to end-stage renal disease and the impact of CRI on the risk of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease are not well understood.  We propose to establish a joint San Francisco Bay Area Clinical Center between Kaiser Permanente of Northern California and the University of California, San Francisco to contribute to the NIDDK-sponsored cohort of 3000 patients with mild-to-moderate CRI. We will enroll 520 subjects: 410 from Kaiser Permanente and 110 subjects from the University of California, San Francisco as well as provide a unique, large automated matched cohort of adults from Kaiser with preserved renal function. The specific aims of the study are: Aim 1: To characterize the progression of renal insufficiency in ambulatory patients and to identify  predictors of rapid deterioration of renal function. Aim 2: To determine how the risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular  events is associated with the severity of renal insufficiency and how its relationship is  affected by \"traditional\" and \"novel\" vascular risk factors in different patient subgroups. Aim 3: To assess the variation in the access and quality of care for patients with chronic renal  insufficiency across sociodemographic subgroups, geographic areas, and health systems  and its association with clinical outcomes Aim 4: To evaluate the clinical and prognostic utility of measured glomerular filtration rate  normalized to body surface area compared to serum creatinine, estimated or measured  creatinine clearance, estimated glomerular filtration rate and measured absolute glomerular  filtration rate across different demographic and disease subgroups',\n",

CKD is a major risk factor for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and premature death. Understanding novel risk factors for the progression of CKD and associated CVD may help to develop effective approaches for early intervention in order to reduce the adverse disease burden.  [unreadable] The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study is a NIDDK-sponsored multi-center prospective cohort study. The overall objective of the CRIC study is to investigate novel risk factors for the progression of CKD and development of CVD among patients with chronic renal insufficiency. The CRIC study has recruited 3,612 adult patients with CKD from 7 clinical centers in the US. The study participants are followed for renal and cardiovascular outcomes up to 5 years in the initial phase (CRIC phase-1). The CRIC Tulane Clinical Center recruited 405 study participants and achieved a respective follow-up rate despite devastation caused by hurricane Katrina in the New Orleans area.  [unreadable] The proposed CRIC phase-2 which extends follow-up through 2013, offers a unique opportunity to leverage the existing effort and success of CRIC to establish a cohort of CKD participants who have long-term prospective follow-up on progression of kidney disease and a variety of different outcomes. This unparalleled resource will also expand the science related to CKD natural history as well as the impact on CVD and other adverse events. Specific aims to be addressed by the Tulane Clinical Center are: (1). to re-enroll a high percentage of CRIC phase-1 participants into phase-2; (2). to collect exposure and outcome data per the CRIC phase 1 and 2 protocols; (3). to maintain high levels of retention in the study; (4). to investigate self-reported clinical events and obtain supporting medical records and documentation; (5). to enter data and process/ship biological specimens; (6). to implement local quality assurance and quality control procedures as a means to obtain standardized, high quality measurements; (7). to monitor data collection, data entry, and follow-up rates; (8). to participate in governance and oversight of the CRIC study through study-wide subcommittees and activities; (9). to publish and present findings from the CRIC Study; and (10). to promote and support the conduct of ancillary studies in CRIC, including collaboration with the broader nephrology research community.   [unreadable] The proposed study may provide insights into the underlying etiology of progression of CKD and related CVD and information for developing further intervention studies aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality of ESRD and CVD among patients with CKD.

Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) affects over 10 million Americans. Their burden of morbidity derives from their frequent progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and disproportionate risk of cardiovascular events. A shared set of etiological factors is being identified as potentially responsible for both progressive renal disease and cardiovascular disease (CVD) including clinical and biomarkers. Characterizing relationships between these risk factors and outcomes will permit development of instruments to predict poor outcomes in patients with CRI and enhance understanding of etiological mechanisms leading to these outcomes. Between 2001-2007, the Prospective Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study enrolled >3600 adults with chronic kidney disease to address overarching goals of identifying predictors of rapid progression of kidney disease and clarifying the relationship between kidney dysfunction and the risks of subclinical and clinical cardiovascular events, death, and resource utilization through an initial 5-year follow-up. Under the leadership of investigators at Penn, subject recruitment and retention have exceeded goals and the quality of data has been outstanding. In addition, the CRIC Ancillary Studies Program has been remarkably successful in expanding the scientific scope of CRIC through 23 funded federal awards. The proposed Phase 2 of CRIC, which extends follow-up through 2013, offers a unique opportunity to leverage the existing effort and success of CRIC to establish a cohort of participants with chronic kidney disease who have long-term prospective follow-up on progression of kidney disease and a variety of outcomes including post-end-stage renal disease health status.

       " 'DESCRIPTION(provided by applicant): This is an application from the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB) at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center to serve as the Scientific and Data Coordinating Center (CRI-SDCC) for the Prospective Cohort Study of Chronic Renal Insufficiency. Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) affects over 10 million Americans. Their burden of morbidity derives from their frequent progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and disproportionate risk of cardiovascular events. A shared set of etiological factors is being identified as potentially responsible for both progressive renal disease-and cardiovascular disease (CVD). These include clinical characteristics and biomarkers (e.g., physiological measures, circulating humoral factors, and genotypes). Characterizing relationships between these risk factors and outcomes will permit development of instruments to predict poor outcomes in patients with CRI and enhance understanding of etiological mechanisms leading to these outcomes. Activities focused on prediction and mechanisms of progressive renal disease and cardiovascular events in patients with CRI will be the primary tasks of the NIDDK CRI Research Network (CRIRN) and the overall goals in this proposal for a CRI-SDCC for the CRIRN. In meeting these goals the CRI-SDCC will provide scientific and logistical coordination for the CRIRN. Expertise in the CRI-SDCC will span the range of etiological factors the CRIRN will explore and complement expertise among investigators at the Clinical Centers (CCs) and the NIH. The CRI-SDCC will provide scientific coordination to ensure the CRIRN identifies and pursues the most salient issues facing the CRI population. The logistical coordination provided by the CRI-SDCC will employ its extensive experience as a DCC and techniques from prior successful multi-institutional cohort research that incorporate state-of-the-art World Wide Web-based coordination of data/specimen collection, quality assurance, and data analysis. Broadly, the Specific Aims for the CRI-SDCC are to assist in collaboratively setting the scientific agenda of the CRIRN and to provide logistical coordination to implement the cohort study. Specifically, the SDCC will: 1: Contribute content (e.g., renal epidemiology, nephrology, and cardiology) expertise and share scientific leadership of the CRIRN through the Steering and Planning Committee as it identifies and prioritizes specific areas of investigation and later refines and modifies the CRIRN?s scientific direction based on interim analyses and emerging scientific knowledge; 2: Develop a cohort study design, protocol, and analysis plan for the CRIRN?s chosen areas of study and studies beyond the initial scope of its research activities; 3: Form and establish a Collaborative CRI Research Network (CRIRN), its Steering and Planning Committee, and coordinate communication and logistics for its meetings; 4: Develop a World Wide Web-based data management system; S: Develop all materials required for a comprehensive data management plan; 6: Establish CRIRN-wide quality assurance standards and practices; 7: Prepare and coordinate abstracts, professional materials, and manuscripts.',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, advanced glycation end products (AGE), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have emerged as important mediators of diabetes-induced tissue injury. However, the precise cellular targets and molecular mechanisms by which these mediators cause cellular injury in the kidney remain poorly defined.  [unreadable] Both, glomerular (podocytes) and tubular epithelial cells are now emerging as important targets for diabetes-induced injury in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Thus, podocyte depletion has been described recently in humans with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM) diabetes, and is considered a strong predictor for the development of proteinuria. In addition, tubular epithelial apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may underlie the initiation of tubulointerstitial progression of DN.   [unreadable] We present preliminary results that provide a compelling rationale to focus our research program on investigating the emerging role and mechanisms of epithelial cell injury in DN. Specifically, we will test two novel hypotheses: 1. The peroxisomal membrane proteins Mpv17l and/or Mpv17 are essential regulators of antioxidant defenses in glomerular podocytes and protect against diabetes-induced podocyte apoptosis and podocyte depletion (Bottinger, Mount Sinai); and 2. CD36 scavenger receptor for AGE and/or FFA is an essential mediator of AGE and/or FFA-induced tubular epithelial injury/apoptosis and tubulointerstitial progression of DN (Susztak, AECOM).  [unreadable] The Specific Aims of this proposal are to test:  [unreadable] 1. whether peroxisomal membrane proteins regulate antioxidant defense mechanisms in podocytes, and protect against ROS-mediated podocyte injury/apoptosis induced by diabetes  [unreadable] 2. whether Mpv17-deficiency accelerates and increases podocyte apoptosis and depletion leading to progressive glomerulosclerosis and/or nodules in diabetic mouse models   [unreadable] 3. which CD36-dependent intracellular pathways signal AGE and FFA induced tubular epithelial injury/apoptosis   [unreadable] 4. whether proximal tubular overexpression of AGE binding proteins CD36 and RAGE leads to increased tubular epithelial injury/apoptosis and tubulointerstitial progression of DN in mice  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] The goal of the AMDCC is to develop animal models of diabetic complications that faithfully reproduce diabetic complications observed in humans. This proposal will provide a model of mouse model of diabetic nephropathy (DN) focusing on two key protective endothelial pathways: eNOS and prostacyclin synthase (PGIS). These pathways are not only co-localized within the endothelial cells but their activity is also biochemically interrelated through cellular levels of peroxynitrate, and both that have been implicated in human diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy and macrovascular disease. In the previous funding cycle, the Vanderbilt AMDCC site investigated the genetic underpinnings of diabetic nephropathy (DN) of mice. Those studies identified systemic eNOS deletion as a critical genetic modifier that converts C57BL/6 mice from a resistant strain to one that is susceptible to DN. Genetic disruption of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS or NOSIII), but not ApoE or LDLR was associated with a marked acceleration of DN in C57BL/6, not only characterized by a robust albuminuria, but also by dramatic mesangiolysis and expansion with decrease renal function (GFR). The involvement of eNOS as a clinically relevant modifier for risk of human diabetic nephropathy is bolstered by clinical studies showing that diabetics with an eNOS Glu298Asp polymorphism not only exhibit decreased eNOS activity but also an accelerated risk of renal failure {Noiri, 2002 #6975; Shin Shin, 2004 #8934}. Accumulating evidence implicates endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, particularly nephropathy and macrovascular disease {Schalkwijk, 2005 #9302}. Similarly polymorphisms have been identified in prostacyclin synthase (PGIS), although their specific role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy has not been established,  [unreadable] The present proposal has two specific aims: Aim 1 will determine the role of endothelial eNOS in the progression of diabetic nephropathy; while To determine the role of Endothelial prostacyclin synthase in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. To achieve this we will generate conditionally targeted (floxed) eNOS and PGIS alleles, and cross these mice with a Tie2mERCre mouse, allowing temporally controlled deletion of these alleles specifically from the endothelium. These studies should allow the dissection of the role of these biochemical pathways in the progression of diabetic nephropathy in mice.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " 'The incidence of End Stage Renal Disease, with its attendant morbidity, mortality and neaim care costs continues to rise every year. In addition, the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is approximately 30 times higher in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) compared to the general population. This project proposes to follow a cohort of 3000 patients with CRI to determine the factors associated with decline in renal function and the development and progression of CVD. This will set the stage to develop strategies to reduce the progression of CRI and CVD in this high-risk population. This center has assembled a multidisciplinary team of experienced investigators with documented expertise in recruitment and retention of participants in long term cardiovascular and renal trials. Another strength of our center is the collaborative approach between the diverse health care systems encompassing the vast majority of the health care market in this area (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Louis Stokes Cleveland VAMC, Metrohealth Medical Center, Ohio Permanente Medical Group, and University Hospitals of Cleveland). It has already been determined that over 14,000 patients in these institutions have a documented serum creatinine level that would make them eligible for participation in this study. Patient identification and recruitment will be consistent with current guidelines regarding confidentiality. Baseline evaluation will include assessment of renal function, and prevalent clinical and subclinical CVD. Relevant patient, environmental, and access to health care related factors that may contribute to progression of renal insufficiency will be measured. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, as well as those associated with the underlying disease and renal dysfunction will also be assessed. Serial measurements of central arterial compliance will be performed in a subset of patients. Patients will be followed with annual examinations and phone interviews every six months. Clinically relevant outcomes of renal and cardiovascular disease are proposed. Our experienced research staff will be instrumental in the retention of participants and ascertainment of outcomes.

The incidence and prevalence of endstage kidney disease are relentlessly increasing, along with attendant co-morbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease. CRIC is a longitudinal, observational study that will determine the risk factors for progressionof chronic renal insufficiency and the risk factors for cardiovascular disease in a cohort of individuals with impaired kidney function. Participants will be 3,000 individuals (250 at Hopkins, 250 at Maryland),50% diabetic and 50% non-diabetic, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30-70 ml/min/1.73 m2.

The primary goals of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study will be: (1) to determine the risk factors for accelerated decline in renal function; and (2) to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: We propose to recruit 500 patients of which at least 30% are African American and 50% have diabetic nephropathy. We will recruit the study participants from 12,729 prescreened patients with CRI from our integrated clinical research units consisting of: The University of Michigan Health System (n=5,807); Veteran Affairs Medical Center, Ann Arbor (n=358); St. Johns Health System, Detroit (n=l,430); and The Wellness Plan, Detroit (n=5,134). Ongoing clinicalresearch efforts of the proposing team (includingCRI Pilot Study of 105 patients and AASK) have documented an overall participationpotential of 17.6% in the  12,729 prescreened subjects which enables a final pool of 2,321 subjects. Our recruitment strategies and retention/adherence techniques have been previously tested and logistically refined. Proposed primary outcomes variables are: (1) the mean rate of GFR decline; (2) time to end stage renal disease (ESRD); (3) composite fatal and nonfatal CVD events; and (4) all-cause mortality rate. Key explanatory variables to be studied include: Left Ventricular imaging (Echocardiography); Carotid Intima/Media Thickness (B-mode ultrasonography); and Cardiac Dysautonomia ([\"C]-hydroxyephedrine {HED} Positron Emission Tomography). All key  study measurements will be obtained during a single 24-hour in-patient GCRC yearly visit supplemented with standardized,regularly scheduled, interval ascertainment non-visit procedures. ANALYSIS PLAN: For analytic efficiency, we propose a stratified recruitment scheme that allows broad distributionover the entire inclusionGFR range. We propose a two-stage analysis of the slope of GFR consisting of within-patientGFR slope estimates and across-patient slope analysis to evaluate the determinants of variationin the slope using repeated measures analysis and linear regression analysis, respectively. Time to event analyses will be carried out until ESRD, de novo/recurrent CVD event or death using a multivariateCox regression technique. A sample of 3,000 patients will be sufficient to yield 90% power to detect differences in rates of decline of GFR as small as 12% to 15% of the mean, and to detect increases as small as 16% to 40% in the rates of events (ESRD, death, CVD). SIGNIFICANCE: This study will lead improved patient care and generate new hypotheses about potential predictors of CRI progression and CVD complications. The most promising of these hypotheses will require testing in randomized clinical trials.',\n",

As of 1997 it is estimated that worldwide about 124 million individuals had diabetes mellitus, of which 3.5 million have type 1 diabetes, the majority of these having an onset during childhood. In the US alone,approximately 15.7 million individuals, or 5.9% of the total population have diabetes, with at least 500,000 or 0.12% of the US population, 1.2 per 1000 population, then having type 1 diabetesmellitus.  The onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus is one step in a chain of events that begins at the moment of conception. Genetic polymorphisms,principallyHLA haplotypes, have been identified that confer an increased risk of developing diabetes, or are protective.Genetic defects render an individual susceptible to an aberrant immunologicresponse to one of possibly many environmental insults. Following the environmental trigger, the T-cells begin an assault on the insulin- producing beta or islet cells of the pancreas. This autoimmuneresponse is manifest by the appearance of antibodies and the subsequent loss of first phase insulin response. Thereafter beta cell function declines. This makes it feasible to conduct studies of the genetics of type 1 diabetes and immune tolerance, the role of environmental pathogens, the characterization of autoimmunity and immune tolerance, evaluation of the risk of developing diabetes, and various interventions aimed at immune tolerance or preservation of beta cell function.  The objective of The George Washington University Biostatistics Center is to apply our considerable resources and experience to the completion of the following main tasks to ensure the clinical and scientific success of the multifaceted studies to be undertaken and completed by TrialNet. (1) Study Coordination and Planning: We will help establish an efficient organizational structure to ensure that all activities advance in a coordinated fashion.

       " 'This proposal is submitted by The Biostatistics Center of The George Washington University to serve as the Operations Coordinating Center for TrialNet in response to RFA DK-01-004 \"Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet: Core Support Facilities.\" The functions of the Operations CoordinatingCenter (OCC) for TrialNet are to provide for thecontinuation of the ongoing DPT-1 parenteral and oral insulin primary prevention trials and to support future studies with the ultimate objective of prevention of type 1diabetes and its amelioration.  As of 1997 it is estimated that worldwide about 124 million individuals had diabetes mellitus, of which 3.5 million have type 1 diabetes, the majority of these having an onset during childhood. In the US alone,approximately 15.7 million individuals, or 5.9% of the total population have diabetes, with at least 500,000 or 0.12% of the US population, 1.2 per 1000 population, then having type 1 diabetesmellitus.  The onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus is one step in a chain of events that begins at the moment of conception. Genetic polymorphisms,principallyHLA haplotypes, have been identified that confer an increased risk of developing diabetes, or are protective.Genetic defects render an individual susceptible to an aberrant immunologicresponse to one of possibly many environmental insults. Following the environmental trigger, the T-cells begin an assault on the insulin- producing beta or islet cells of the pancreas. This autoimmuneresponse is manifest by the appearance of antibodies and the subsequent loss of first phase insulin response. Thereafter beta cell function declines. This makes it feasible to conduct studies of the genetics of type 1 diabetes and immune tolerance, the role of environmental pathogens, the characterization of autoimmunity and immune tolerance, evaluation of the risk of developing diabetes, and various interventions aimed at immune tolerance or preservation of beta cell function.  The objective of The George Washington University Biostatistics Center is to apply our considerable resources and experience to the completion of the following main tasks to ensure the clinical and scientific success of the multifaceted studies to be undertaken and completed by TrialNet. (1) Study Coordination and Planning: We will help establish an efficient organizational structure to ensure that all activities advance in a coordinated fashion. (2) Data Management Activities: We will apply our established systems for on-going data collection and data management, and will generate periodic reports summarizing the execution of the trial. (3) Statistical Analysis: We will provide statistical leadership in the design of studies, and perform interim and final analyses in an expeditious and timely manner. (4) Documentation: We will provide for the orderly closeout of all studies with complete documentation and dissemination of relevant materials to the NIH and the public.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in obese children, particularly in minority ethnic groups, is an enormous public health problem. The early age of onset of T2DM in youth may particularly increase the risk of devastating complications which are known to be directly related to the degree and duration of hyperglycemia. There is strong evidence from studies in adults (UKPDS) that normalization of glucose greatly decreases the frequency of microvascular complications of T2DM. It is, therefore, imperative to aggressively treat T2DM in order to reach long-term glycemic control in youths. The UKPDS also showed that life style intervention or monotherapy with insulin or metformin alone is usually insufficient to maintain long-term diabetes control. We, hereby, propose to test the hypothesis that the combined use of therapeutic agents that reverses or improves insulin resistance and restores first phase insulin secretion VS monotherapy with metformin alone will serve to preserve B-cell function in youth with new onset T2DM and increase the likelihood of achieving and maintaining strict metabolic control of diabetes. We seek to serve for a clinical site for a multi center trial site for the treatment of T2DM in children and adolescents of different ethnic groups. At randomization patients will be allocated to 4 treatment strategies: 1) metformin alone; 2) metformin plus inhaled insulin; 3) metformin plus nateglinide and 4) piozlitazone plus metformin. The primary efficacy aim is: To examine and compare the effects of the treatments on overall diabetes control, as assessed by sequential HbA1c level less than or equal to 7.0 percent. Furthermore, to determine differences in the ability of treatments regimens to achieve and maintain target HbA1c levels less than or equal to 7 percent. Secondary efficacy aims: To examine and compare the effects of the treatment on macrovascular risk factors (lipid profiles, post-prandial hyperglycemia etc.); preservation of B-cell function as assessed by the C-peptide stimulation test; development and progression of microvascular complications and psychosocial well being. Safety aims are hypoglycemia; accelerated weight gain and known potential adverse effects of pharmacological agents. To accomplish these goals and to best perform as a clinical site in the multi center treatment trial of T2DM in youth, we have brought together a team of researchers with expertise in childhood obesity, T1 and T2DM in youth, pharmacological studies in children (Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit, PPRU) and community based interventions.',\n",
       " 'In this seven year cooperative agreement we propose to test a school- based intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes (T2D) in children and adolescents. Obesity is increasing markedly in American youth, and this increase, which is already accompanied by an explosion in the incidence of T2D in youth, is expected to further increase unless effective interventions can be instituted. The proposed study will test an environmental and lifestyle intervention that could serve as a model for long-term school-based interventions to reduce obesity and prevent T2DM in schools throughout the US. The specific aim of this proposal is to test a longitudinal school-based intervention to prevent T2D and insulin resistance in elementary and middle school youth. The primary focus of the intervention will be to add a prescribed physical activity program to the school curriculum for one, two or three years, and to modify access of youth to soft drinks at school. Additional components of the intervention will be intermittent classes to increase knowledge and influence attitudes about physical activity, nutrition, and diabetes, and some involvement of the parents. Elementary and middle schools will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Participants will be 3939 youth with parental consent and personal assent. Data will be collected at baseline and annually for four more years. A subset of youth at greatest risk for T2D (body mass index equal to or > 85th percentile of national norms and T2D in first or second degree relatives and fast insulin equal to or > 25 micrograms/ml) from both groups will receive an oral glucose tolerance test. All data will be collected at the study schools. The primary outcome of the study will be the development of T2D (fasting glucose equal to or > 126 mg/dl) or impaired fasting glucose (fasting blood glucose 110 -125 mg/d). We hypothesize that, as compared with children in the control schools, fewer youth in the intervention schools will develop T2D or impaired fasting glucose. Secondary outcomes of interest that also will be addressed by the proposed study include: 1) Insulin resistance, determined with a combination of factors that will include high fasting serum insulin levels, insulin sensitivity index, acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, specific dyslipidemias (low high density lipoproteins [HDL-C] and high triglycerides [TG]); 2) General obesity (body mass index and sum of skinfolds); 3) Central obesity (waist and hip circumferences; 4) Aerobic power (V02max.); 5) Health Behaviors, specifically, physical activity and eating habits; and 6) health knowledge about ways to prevent T2DM. We hypothesize that, as compared with children in the control schools, fewer children receiving the intervention will exhibit insulin resistance, fewer children will show general and central obesity, and more children will have improved their aerobic power (pVO2), physical activity, eating habits, and health knowledge. Since the proposed study is a cooperative agreement involving multiple sites, the actual aims, variables and procedures will most likely be modified during the initial planning year.',\n",

       " \"Until recently, Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) was considered an adult disease. Increasing numbers of children and adolescents, primarily of African- American and Hispanic ethnicity, have been diagnosed with T2DM. The increased incidence of T2DM among children is a serious problem with significant implications for future morbidity and mortality from micro- and macro-vascular complications. Mean age of onset is 13.5 years. This is an especially severe problem in children from ethnic minority groups who are considered difficult to reach. Three risk factors have been associated with T2DM in children: family history of diabetes, obesity, and the presence of acanthosis nigricans. Of these, only obesity is preventable of reduce obesity. Prevention involves the adoption of healthy dietary and physical activity lifestyle behaviors that prevent or reduce obesity. Sixth grade is an important time for prevention because these children assume more responsibility for dietary and physical activity choices. School-based programs offer the best hope of reaching large numbers of these children and educating them to reduce their tasks. Family involvement is important, as the family provides the home environment and support for the dietary and physical activity behaviors. We propose to develop, implement, and evaluate a 5 component middle school-based intervention based on Social Cognitive Theory, targeting African-American and Hispanic children beginning at 11 years of age (6th grade) to reduce T2DM risks. Within the school environment, a cafeteria-based dietary intervention will promote water fruit, 100% fruit juice, vegetable and lower fat food consumption. 2. A physical education (PE) program will promote maintaining moderate to vigorous physical activity during a majority of the PE class period. 3. A club (to be named for focus groups) will be created during the school lung period under the sponsorship of the school nurse, and used to conduct behavior change activities encouraging water, fruit, 100% juice, vegetable, and lower fat food consumption and regular physical activity outside of school. These clubs will meet twice a month the first year, and monthly during the second and third years (7th and 8th grade), and use an intervention booklet that includes a photo novela like story line with goal setting and problem solving activities.  4. A series of 8 short video tapes on parenting in regard to children's healthy dietary and physical activity behaviors will be produced in English and Spanish, and mailed to the parents of the at risk students. 5. A motivational interview will be conducted with parents of the target child at baseline. Insulin sensitivity, weight, dietary and physical activity behaviors will be measured 4 times: baseline, after 1 year of intervention, and after the second and third years of intervention. We have substantial experience in designing, implementing, and evaluating behavioral change programs with children and their parents in both these ethnic groups. his theory-based program has the potential to enable youth to reduce their risks for T2DM. Tests of the proposed hypotheses will identify key variables mediating the intervention effects, and thereby elucidate our understanding of how behavior change programs work.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, an increasing number of cases of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in children have become evident, a phenomenon which is thought to be related to widespread obesity, decreased physical activity, and other factors. The rising rates of diabetes among children represent a disturbing trend with significant implications for future health care costs to society. Currently, there are no widely accepted clinical recommendations for screening or managing this condition in the pediatric population. A program is being established by the NIH to address this emerging health problem by implementing an intervention trial to identify appropriate treatment of childhood T2DM. The Children?s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) proposes to be a clinical site. Philadelphia is representative of urban America and has a large proportion of African-American and Hispanic high-risk minorities. The Diabetes Care Center (DCC) at CHOP currently follows over 1100 children with diabetes and diagnoses 30 new cases per year of T2DM. Given that the majority of children with T2DM suffer from obesity, with resultant insulin resistance, we hypothesize that improvement of peripheral insulin sensitivity will be the most effective treatment, both for glucose control and for the preservation of insulin secretion. The aims of this proposal are: 1) To evaluate glucose control of pediatric Type 2 diabetes patients on monotherapy with either a thiazolidinedione, a biguanide, or a sulfonylurea in a prospective double blind randomized trial. 2) To evaluate secondary outcome measures including insulin secretory function, insulin sensitivity glucose tolerance and body composition over time, in relation to treatment interventions, glucose control, and psychosocial functioning. 3) To evaluate glucose control on combination therapy with 2 oral agents in pediatric subjects with T2DM who have demonstrated inadequate glucose control (hemoglobin A1c>6.5) after 6 months on a single oral agent; 4) To establish and sustain a local network of partnerships with health care providers, health care systems, and community agencies in Philadelphia to support effective implementation of lifestyle changes critical to the management of childhood T2DM. and finally 5) To evaluates the impact of the local network on lifestyle modification on specific patient?s outcomes over time such as weight and BMI, psychological function, diet, and physical fitness. Aim 1 is completed after 6 months of the monotherapy. Subsequently, the patients are followed for 5 years. To achieve these aims, CHOP will build upon its existing resources within the DCC, the Nutrition Section, and Department of Psychiatry. New and existing partnerships will be forged and reinforced with members of the Philadelphia community to implement lifestyle changes.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, type 2 diabetes has been recognized as increasingly common among children and adolescents and data from diabetes referral centers indicate that type 2 diabetes now accounts for approximately 40 percent of patients diagnosed with diabetes between the ages of 10-19 years. A number of large epidemiological studies are currently underway to address the question of the true incidence of type 2 diabetes in the pediatric age population. However, despite this increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents, there have been no large published studies examining the efficacy of potential treatment interventions. Rather, pediatric diabetologists have had to rely on treatment approaches based on the understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, and the results from treatment studies in adult patients. However, the relevance of adult studies to the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adolescents and children is unclear. This proposal aims to address the lack of such studies. Our intent is to participate in a multi-center, randomized, clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of potential treatment options for this disorder. We propose a four-arm trial, where participants are randomized to one of the following initial interventions: 1) metformin; 2) intensive lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss and alter diet, physical activity; and behavior patterns; 3) intensive lifestyle intervention plus metformin; 4) insulin. We also propose an approach for stepped-care for patients failing to meet minimum goals for glycemic control in their initial assigned treatment arm. This four-year study will assess the relative efficacy and safety of each of the experimental interventions, examining the primary outcomes of glycemic control and changes in insulin sensitivity and secretion. Associated secondary outcomes will include effects of treatment alternatives on body composition, cardiovascular fitness, cardiovascular risk factors, incidence of diabetes-related complications, as well as patient quality of life. It is anticipated that this trial will provide critical information to guide practitioners in the effective care of these patients, as well as establishing the infrastructure for an ongoing consortium of centers interested in the coordinated study of pediatric type 2 diabetes.',\n",
       " 'The overall aim of this research is to introduce an innovative approach to increase physical activity in schools, and thereby, decrease risk factors for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. Since very little is known about the fundamental interrelationships among fitness, body composition, and physiological markers of glucose homeostasis in growing children, the research is also aimed at filling key gaps in this knowledge base. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to develop, implement, and test the effectiveness of: a school-based physical activity enhancement program, Fitness Laboratory On Wheels (FLOW); and a complementary school-based teacher/student education program to enhance physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviors. A prospective, repeated-measures, exercise-intervention/control study is planned. The intervention will span the 7th and 8th grades with an additional two-year follow-up. To test the specific effects of the exercise program per se, but recognizing as well, the role of diet in ameliorating the risk of type 2 diabetes, a nutrition education program will be implemented in both control and exercise intervention schools. The following hypotheses will be tested: the two-year intervention will lead to (1) Improved insulin sensitivity and/or improved recovery from the natural fall in insulin sensitivity that occurs during puberty; (2) An increase in physical fitness by at least 10% (accounting for natural growth and development) and enhanced physical activity behaviors; (3) Improvement in anatomic markers of type 2 diabetes risk; (4) Improvement in novel biochemical markers associated with diabetes risk; and (5) A sustained ;improvement in these variables for at least 2 years following the intervention. Major outcome variables include: \"traditional\" markers of glucose homeostasis - fasting insulin and glucose (all subjects) and insulin sensitivity, glucose effectiveness, and acute insulin response (sub-study with frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test - FSIVGTT); novel markers of type 2 diabetes risk - growth hormone binding protein (GHBP), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), and tumor-necrosis  factor-alpha (TNF-alpha); peak oxygen uptake from ergometer exercise tests; body composition by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA); and psychosocial tests of exercise-associated behaviors. A physiological assessment protocol that would be both feasible and fun for the majority of volunteers was successfully pilot tested. It was demonstrated that in a single morning, groups of children can be transported from a target school to an available clinical research center and comfortably undergo a testing strategy called \"BEDD\" [(1) fasting blood sampling, (2) exercise testing, (3) DEXA measurements of body composition, and (4) diet recall]. Power analysis based on fasting insulin levels in healthy children suggests that a multi-center study (3-4 centers with 4-5 schools per center) would be needed to achieve these aims.',\n",

Registry membership includes a central statistical and data Coordinating Center located at The EMMES Corporation in Rockville, Maryland, and 39 Transplant Centers from the US and Canada. Data is submitted over a secure password protected Internet data entry system. The activities of the registry are governed by a Scientific Advisory Board. This application seeks to secure 5-year funding in order to assess factors predicting both short and long-term (5 years or more) outcomes overall and within primary disease subgroups (biliary atresia, metabolic disease, tumor, autoimmune hepatitis, etc.). This funding will permit SPLIT to continue registration and close follow-up of patients. Registration of children in the database as of the 2002 Annual Report is 1,721 listed children with 1,187 receiving a transplant. Five-year follow-up is available for 64 children from 11 centers. If this grant were funded, by the end of the grant period it is estimated that 5-year data would be available from over 900 children from 36 centers. This would be the largest cohort of pediatric liver recipients with long term followup ever studied in the depth. This application focuses on two specific aims. The first is to develop and test models which predict short and long-term patient and graft survival and graft function of children after liver transplantation, as well as from the time of listing. Baseline factors including status at transplantation, operative factors and post-transplant complications will be evaluated and are expected to vary based on primary disease diagnosis. The second aim is to study long term consequences of liver transplantation and immunosuppression in children including: renal function, post transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), cardiovascular risk factors and growth failure. SPLIT's unique sample will allow determination of the prevalence of morbidities associated with long term immunosuppression and identification of the predictors of those morbidities. SPLIT provides an established organizational framework with a track record of success.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant) Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is defined histologically as a spectrum of liver diseases, ranging from steatosis to steatohepatitis (NASH), and cirrhosis. There is tremendous inter-individual variability in the tendency to develop cirrhosis, the stage of NAFLD that is associated with the greatest liver-related morbidity and mortality. The variable progression of NAFLD may be explained by the \"multiple hit hypothesis\". According to this hypothesis, a primary insult (i.e., \"hit\") causes normal livers to accumulate fat. Evidence suggests that the first \"hit\" that causes fat to accumulate in the liver is insulin resistance, which may be either primary or secondary to obesity. Fatty livers are unusually vulnerable to damage from various secondary insults and NASH develops when fatty livers experience a second \"hit\", such as exposure to intestinal bacterial products that induce inflammatory cytokines, which cause oxidative stress and further mitochondrial dysfunction. Because NASH does not always culminate in cirrhosis, it is likely that additional \"hits\" may be required for hepatic fibrosis to occur. Progression from clinically-compensated to decompensated cirrhosis may require further insults. If this \"multiple-hit hypothesis\" explains the histological and clinical progression of NAFLD, then interventions which remove the vulnerability state by reversing hepatic steatosis, or which prevent the superimposition of the secondary \"hits\" should be effective treatments. To test the validity of these therapeutic strategies, we propose 3 SPECIFIC AIMS. Aim #1 is to create and maintain a NAFLD registry. This will be accomplished by screening various populations that have a high risk of NAFLD to determine if there are host or environmental factors (i.e., \"hits\") that distinguish subjects without fatty liver from those with fatty livers, as well as factors that distinguish among the various histologic stages of NAFLD. Aim #2 is to identify promising treatments that may prevent the progression of NAFLD by improving one or more of the \"hits\". This will be accomplished y retrospective analysis of trials that have already tried to improve the putative, primary \"hit\" (Aim #2a) and by a prospective valuation of the importance of intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which may generate putative secondary \"hits\"(Aim #2b). Aim #3 is to design and conduct a Network-wide randomized, controlled trial in patients with NAFLD. Assuming that insulin resistance emerges as a promising target for therapy, we will test the hypothesis that a 12-month course of metformin therapy will produce significant improvement in hepatic steatosis and in NAFLD-related metabolic factors without adverse effects. Completion of these Aims will provide important information about host and environmental factors that promote NAFLD and is likely to identify treatments that prevent the progression from steatosis to NASH and more advanced stages of liver damage.',\n",
       " 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFL or NAFLD) and its subset, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are increasingly recognized as common forms of liver disease.. In the absence of concomitant cellular injury, fatty liver is a benign condition that may cause elevated liver enzymes, fatigue and abdominal pain. MASH is identified by the presence of fat in the liver plus hepatocellular injury, inflammation and varying degrees of liver fibrosis. It afflicts up to 3% of adults n the United States and one third of these people may be at risk for developing cirrhosis. NASH also affects children, although its prevalence in the pediatric population is less well defined. Currently 2% of liver transplants performed in the United States are performed because of known diagnosis of NASH. Insulin resistance, with its major associated diseases of obesity and Type 2 diabetes, is emerging as a major coexisting condition. This application proposes two clinical studies to be performed in the context of a cooperative clinical research network to achieve the long-term goals of establishing the role of hyperinsulinemia in the pathogenesis of NASH and identifying rational and effect strategies to prevent and cure NASH. These goals will be addressed by specific aims of this proposal that seek to better understand the prevalence of NASH in hyperinsulinemic patients and establish whether reducing insulin levels pharmacologically improves the necroinflammatory changes associated with NASH. Two clinical studies are proposed. The first study establishes the prevalence of NASH in patients with hyprinsulinemia and imaging evidence of fatty liver. A secondary goal of the prevalence study is to establish racial differences in the risk for developing NASH because NASH may be underrepresented or underdiagnosed in African Americans. Enrollment will include adequate African Americans to allow subgroup analysis. The second proposed study is to a 48 week treatment trail of patients with NASH using the PPAR-gamma ligand rosiglitazone and, if needed to control hyperinsulinemia, metformin. Liver biopsies of patients recruited from all Clinical Centers will be compared to liver biopsies of patients treated with the standard recommendation of weight reduction. The primary endpoint will be improvement in the liver biopsy necroinflammatory score.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant) Nonalcoholic fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are being increasingly recognized as a cause of chronic liver disease in the USA. NASH is thought to represent a serious form of fatty liver disease, characterized by hepatic steatosis associated with evidence of necroinflammatory changes such as ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, Mallory?s hyaline and variable degrees of fibrosis. The histopathologic features of NASH resemble those of alcoholic liver disease, but are found in the absence of significant alcohol intake. The most common risk factors associated with NASH are type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, use of certain medications, and hyper-triglyceridemia. It has been estimated that up to 20% of the population may have fatty liver, and up to 3% may have NASH. NASH may have a high rate of progression to cirrhosis; furthermore, it is likely that NASH is the cause in a significant proportion of patients undergoing liver transplantation for \"cryptogenic\" liver disease. Therefore, the morbidity, mortality and direct and indirect health care costs associated with NASH are likely to be substantial. However, our understanding of the clinical features, pathogenesis and natural history of NASH is limited by the absence of large epidemiologic studies, and the lack of standardized diagnostic and histopathologic criteria for the diagnosis of this disorder. Recent data suggest that a common feature among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is insulin resistance, which may be primary or secondary, leading to hepatic accumulation of free fatty acids and steatosis. It has been postulated that steatosis may represent the \"first hit\" and that one or more \"second hits\" such as iron overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, activity of cytochrome P450 2E1, 4A1 or other factors may lead to progressive hepatocellular injury and fibrosis (NASH). There are no proven therapies for NASH. Although correction of underlying metabolic defects, low-fat diet, ursodeoxycholic acid therapy and weight loss have been suggested, it is unclear whether any of these treatments are effective. Establishment of the NASH clinical trials network will be an excellent opportunity to establish standardized criteria for diagnosis of this disease, study the natural history and progression of the disease in a large cohort of patients and rapidly evaluate novel treatments. The PI has a long and successful track record of collaborative research in multicenter NIH clinical trials. He has also accumulated a unique cohort of over 100 patients with biopsy proven NASH representing diverse ethnic backgrounds in a major geographic region of the country. The PI also has access to a large pediatric population with NASH. He currently has an ongoing established research program on the pathogenesis and treatment of NASH. He has proposed two studies for the NASH Clinical Research Network that will advance our understanding of this disease. ',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This proposal from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Clinical Trials (CCT) is for a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to support the Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis (NASH) clinical research network. The network will focus on the etiology, natural history, and therapy of NASH. The goal of this consortium is to perform clinical, epidemiological, and therapeutic research in NASH in the United States. The DCC will work with the NIDDK and the Steering Committee (SC) to provide an infrastructure that can rapidly and efficiently design and conduct clinical trials for effective interventions to prevent disease progression. The DCC in collaboration with the SC will work to design, evaluate, and select studies for implementation by assembling and distributing materials needed to decide among design options. At the direction of the SC, the DCC will cull information from the literature or other sources and make sample size calculations needed to make informed selections of standardized outcome measures for each study. For the trials selected by the network, the DCC will play a leadership role in organizing their implementation, conduct, and quality control. The DCC will assume responsibility for all data analytic tasks needed for interim safety and efficacy monitoring and for presentations and publications from the trials. To support these activities, the DCC has assembled an interdisciplinary staff with trial-related expertise and experience in statistical design and analysis, clinical epidemiology, and obesity-related disease. Building from systems developed for ongoing studies coordinated by the CCT, the DCC will provide a comprehensive information management system to support network activities including the development and distribution of design documents (protocols, manuals, forms, policy memoranda, etc), a study website for up-to-date access to study-related materials, a distributed database management system for trial data capture and processing, a reporting system for monitoring recruitment performance and quality control, and analysis systems for interim and final data analysis. The DCC has biostatistical expertise to support the analytic needs of the network including design-specific determinations of sample size and power and the use of standard or non-standard methods for the analysis of data. The DCC will provide other support including the establishment of centralized laboratories, reading centers, or specimen banking resources (possibly through subcontracts, as needed).',\n",
       " 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of chronic liver disease in North America.  It is characterized histologically by either a fatty liver alone or steatohepatitis.  There is increasing evidence that NAFLD is associated with insulin resistance.  Insulin resistance is associated with increased peripheral lipolysis and fatty acid delivery to the liver for uptake, oxidation and resterification to triglycerides.  Recent studies also indicate that NAFLD is associated with increased hepatic oxidant stress.  However, the underlying dietary, psychological and social factors predisposing to development of insulin resistance and NAFLD have not been characterized.  Also, the pathogenetic mechanisms natural history and health impact of NAFLD, particularly non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are not fully known.  Furthermore, there is no established treatment of NASH.  The research plan includes:  (1) An outline of the structure of a large database, to be used by a clinical network for studies on NAFLD, is described.  Justification for the specific information to be entered is provided:  (2) Studies are proposed to test two hypotheses:  (a) that the rate of progression of hepatic fibrosis accelerates after the development of bridging fibrosis in patients with NASH, and (b) specific social and psychological factors contribute to the behavioral profile associated with insulin resistance as well as the likelihood of success of diet and exercise interventions in improving insulin resistance in such patients.  These will be studied by (a) comparing the rates of progression of fibrosis by one grade in patients with NASH with or without bridging fibrosis over a 3 year period,, and (b) determination of eating and exercise behaviors, personality traits and psychopathology in those with NASH and comparison to a control group of patients with hepatitis C. Also, the relationship of these factors with the physiologic and histologic abnormalities present and the success of diet a nd exercise counseling will be assessed.  (3) It is hypothesized that a two-pronged treatment approach correcting insulin resistance with an insulin sensitizer, pioglitazone, and treating oxidant stress with vitamin E is superior to vitamin E alone for the treatment of NASH.  A prospective, randomized short-term ( 1 year duration) clinical trial to test this hypothesis is proposed.  The primary endpoint is the necro-inflammatory grade.  Both studies will require participation of the network.',\n",
       " 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinical-pathological condition with a wide spectrum of histologic abnormalities and clinical outcomes. While hepatic steatosis alone is a benign condition, non- alcohol steatohepatatis (NASH) is the most serious form of NAFLD and is characterized by the histologic findings of alcoholic hepatitis occurring in patients who deny significant alcohol intake. The prevalence of NASH is estimated to be 3% in the general population and up to 20% in patients with type II diabetes and obesity; thereby making NASH the most common form of chronic liver disease in the United States. Over a 10-year period cirrhosis develops in 25% of NASH patients with a liver related mortality of 10%. The pathogenesis of NASH has been proposed to occur in two steps. The first step involves insulin resistance, which causes hepatic seatosis. The second sep involves lipid-laden hepatocytes that serve as a substrate for oxidative stress, which via lipid peroxidation and inflammatory cytokines, results in fibrosis and hepatocyte necrosis. Short duration and small sample size of previous NASH clinical trials have limited these trials from obtaining valid end points. Consequently the therapy of NASH remains uncertain. Therefore, the overall objective of this grant is twofold. The first is to create an infrastructure for patient recruitment and retention in large multi-center trials using carefully defined and uniform criteria for the diagnosis of NASH. The second is to evaluate different therapies directed at both pathogenic steps in NAS. A show-term (6-month) trial will attempt to improve insulin sensitivity by decreasing visceral fat with diet alone or diet plus exercise. In a long-term (3-year) trial, two different doses of vitamin E will be used to reduce oxidative stress and decrease fibrosis. Although both studies could not performed as independent trials, it is anticipated that by performing these trials in series and treating both pathogenetic steps (as proposed), an optimal therapeutic response will be obtained.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant) Pediatric hepatologists in the Joint Program in Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition at the University of California, San Diego propose their inclusion as a Clinical Center in the \"Clinical Research Network in Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis\". Although NASH generally is regarded as a common condition in adults, recent research reveals that NASH is one of the most common causes of liver disease in 10-18 year olds. This application proposes UCSD participation as a center on the basis of past experience of the Principal Investigator with pediatric NASH, the number of children available to our center for studies, and the ethnic diversity of our population based on our unique geographic location. Cooperation of UCSD adult hepatologists and Scripps Clinic hepatologists for referral of adult patients with NASH will allow participation in proposals initiated by other centers in the clinical research network which focus on adults. Our NIH-funded General Clinical Research Center will facilitate all facets of proposed studies. Our application provides a template for preparation of a multicenter database and tissue/serum bank to study pediatric NASH, based on knowledge and experience of the presentation and proposed pathophysiology of the condition. Two proposals are detailed in this application. The first is a prospective, multi-center, epidemiologic analysis of factors associated with the development of NASH in obese children, evaluating the role of age, race and gender. Potential factors involved in pathogenesis will be assessed with respect to pubertal development, insulin resistance, increased exposure to mediators of inflammation, and increased indicators of oxidative stress. The second study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial evaluating treatment of childhood NASH with Vitamin E versus placebo. Children randomized to placebo will serve as a long-term cohort to understand the natural history of this untreated condition with early onset. The treated children, who in previous open-label pilot studies have been shown to normalize serum markers of liver damage, will be rigorously studied to determine if antioxidant therapy improves outcome as assessed by changes in liver histology and markers found associated with NASH pathogenesis.',\n",
       " 'Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease that occurs in individuals without significant alcohol consumption and histologically it resembles alcoholic liver disease with macrovesicularsteatosis, spotty necrosis, inflammation, Mallory bodies, and fibrosis. It is increasingly being recognized as a predominant type of chronic liver disease in the United States; however, its prevalence, pathogenesis, and natural history have not been adequately studied. In order to better understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis and to identify optimal therapy for NASH, we propose to conduct NASH-related clinical research in the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: The objective is to create a database of patients with fatty liver and NASH that will enable us to perform multidisciplinary and multicentered studies on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and therapy of NASH. The subgroups of patients included in this database are adults with fatty liver and NASH, children (< 18yrs of age) with fatty liver and NASH, women with polycystic ovarysyndrome, and appropriately matched controls. The cohort will be characterized clinically, anthropometrically, through laboratory tests, and histologically. A repository containing liver tissue, blood samples, and DNA from subjects with disease and controls will be developed; Specific Aim 2:The overall goal of this specific aim is to derive and validate risk equations that measure and stratify the risk for advanced histology in patients with non- alcoholic fatty liver disease. To this end, we will conduct a multicenter, nested case-control study of patients with simple fatty-liver, non-cirrhotic NASH, and cirrhotic NASH to identify risk factors for advanced histology, and to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule for reliable identification of those with advancedhistology; Specific Aim 3: We hypothesize that insulin resistance is pivotal in the pathogenesis of NASH and measures that improve insulin resistance would lead to an improvement in liver histology in non-diabetic NASH. Here, we propose to conduct a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of moderate weight reduction with or without metformin for 12-months. The primary end-point is the change in liver histology measured by comparing biopsy findings at baseline and at the end of 12-month treatment period. The secondary end-points are changes in insulin resistance, lipid peroxidation, determinants of oxidative stress, anthropometric measurements, liver biochemistry, and the measures of quality of life.',\n",
       " 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of asymptomatic liver test abnormalities in the general population often associated with obesity and insulin resistance. The severe public health problem with a significant impact in terms of morbidity, mortality and health care cost outcomes. This proposal brings together a unique consortium of investigators and resources within the State of California with a plan for participating Clinical Center in the NASH Clinical Research Network. The proposed NASH patient informational database and tissue bank will comprise cross-sectional and prospective cohorts derived from four separate sources, each providing distinct epidemiological facets and research potential. These include tertiary care referral specialty clinics at two large university medical centers and an HMO patient population. We propose to identify patients with definite (biopsy-proven) NASH and probable (association-defined) NAFLD/NASH from these sources, and outline a plan for longitudinal follow-up of selected sub-populations for the purpose of studying the natural history of progression, identification of risk factors for progression and to enable the implementation of therapeutic trials in patients with NASH. Secondly, we describe two research protocols that would use the NASH Clinical Research Network database and tissue bank to test the hypothesis, supported by our preliminary data that familial/genetic factors underlie the development of NASH and its progression. These projects include: 1) Determining genetic factors predisposing to NASH by exploring a possible etiologic relationship between our newly discovered genomic variants and lipid metabolism in patients (and their kindreds) with NASH.  These involve key regulatory components of cellular lipid metabolism (peroxisome proliferator- activated receptors and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and would be prime candidate genes for exploration utilizing the Network resources; and 2) To design and validate a questionnaire to identify factors in the family history that are predictors of the presence of NASH in patients with unexplained chronically elevated aminotransferases and that are independent predictors of disease severity and progression. We plan to use this approach to identify kindreds to correlate familial factors with specific mutations in key regulatory genes of lipid metabolism in order to elucidate the genetic basis for NASH and the putative genetic association between NASH and cryptogenic cirrhosis.',\n",
       " \" DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Washington University proposes to establish the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the Polycystic Kidney Disease Treatment Network (PKD-TN) within the Division of Biostatistics. WU performs a similar function for the NIDDK-sponsored CRISP study that is developing imaging parameters to follow the progression of Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD). WU generally, and this investigative team specifically, has a strong record of experience as the DCC for multicenter studies. The DCC will participate as a key member of the Steering Committee, taking a leadership role in planning the studies, leading the statistical analyses and reporting of these studies. A web-based data entry system, based on the one currently being used for CRISP, will be customized for the needs of the PKD-TN. The DCC will serve as the communications hub for the PKD-TN, arranging meetings, telephone and electronic communications and producing and archiving study-related documents.   A three-group, double-masked, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial will address whether either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensenin 2 antangonist will retard the progression of renal impairment in PKD. The trial will enroll 1,800 PKD subjects with a wide range of renal function and follow them for 3-5 years. The primary endpoint will be that of time to death, ESRD or a doubling of the serum creatinine level. GFR levels will be assessed annually with a central laboratory and will be used as a secondary endpoint. The GFR measurements will allow us to address questions about variations in treatment effect according to the severity of renal impairment and the presence of common features of the disease such as hypertension and proteinuria. Blood and urine samples will be collected at baseline and annually and stored in the NIDDK's repository for future pharmocogenitic studies and future studies of biomarkers of the progression of PKD.   An early Phase II trial of BMP-7, a cytokine which has an essential role in coordinating the formation of the emerging metanephos, is proposed. BMP-7 has been shown to maintain renal function in animal models with acute and chronic renal disease and to reduce renal hypertrophy. A simple, two-group, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial will be conducted to determine whether BMP-7 can retard the growth rate of the kidneys in PKD subjects. MRI-based imaging will be used to measure kidney size for the trial.   \",\n",
       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects one in 500-1000 Americans and leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 50% of patients by age 60 years. Moreover, the life expectancy of ADPKD patients is significantly reduced compared with the general population, despite the availability of dialysis and transplantation, due to premature cardiovascular mortality. Recent advances have lead to greater understanding of the mechanisms of ADPKD, and several agents have been found to slow cyst growth in animal models. However, clinical interventions to ameliorate the course of ADPKD in humans are lacking. Therefore, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has proposed a PKD Clinical Trials Network to design and implement clinical trials to slow the progressive loss of renal function in PKD, including a large trial on blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The PKD Research Center at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center maintains a database of nearly 800 families with ADPKD, and over 1000 family members have participated in previous clinical studies at our Center. Additional patients with ADPKD are available for recruitment from the Polycystic Kidney Research Foundation and from agreements with local health care providers. Thus, we are confident we can identify 500 patients with ADPKD who are eager and eligible to participate in a clinical trial. We propose both a large randomized controlled clinical trial featuring blockade of the RAAS and a pilot study to determine if treatment with an antiangiogenic agent slows the rate of renal growth in patients with ADPKD. Working in collaboration with the PKD Clinical Trials Network, our goal is to identify interventions that not only slow but prevent progression of ADPKD to ESRD, and interventions that ameliorate the cardiovascular complications in ADPKD. A 2 X 2 factorial design is proposed to examine the hypothesis that RAAS inhibition and rigorous blood pressure control will slow progression in advanced ADPKD and prevent progression of renal and cardiovascular disease in early ADPKD.   ',\n",
       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to be a participating clinical center (PCC) in the RFA entitled \"Polycystic Kidney Disease Clinical Trials Network.\" Hypertension is common, occurs early, and is associated with a faster progression to renal failure in ADPKD. We have shown activation of the systemic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in hypertension associated with ADPKD prior to loss of renal function, and that intrarenal activation of RAAS is present. We have demonstrated that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition alone (ACEI) has beneficial effects by reducing proteinuria and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy as well as improving effective renal plasma flow, and this may relate to filtration fraction. In contrast to other kidney diseases, ACEI has not been as successful in preventing loss of renal function. This may relate to study design issues, sample size, inclusion of low risk individuals not progressing, and less than maximal blockade of RAAS. Therefore, we propose to assess the effect of combination therapy, i.e. ACEI, angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB), and aldosterone antagonism (spironolactone) in the setting of rigorous blood pressure control (<125/75 mm Hg) on the rate of loss of renal function in ADPKD while controlling for other potential contributors to loss of renal function. ADPKD children with hypertension demonstrate a greater increase in renal volume than other ADPKD children in the setting of normal renal function. Using MRI, we have shown decreased renal blood flow in ADPKD as compared to age and gender-matched children suggesting that activation of RAAS occurs early in ADPKD children. We propose to study a special population of ADPKD subjects (children) throughout adolescence to determine the safety and efficacy of ACE/ARB combination therapy in the acute and chronic setting on renal blood flow, and the rate of renal cyst and total renal growth. Taken together, these studies will determine if maximal inhibition of RAAS prevents loss of renal function in ADPKD adults and if combination ACEI/ARB therapy maintains renal blood flow while slowing renal and cyst growth in ADPKD children. Ultimately these studies should demonstrate slowing or halting progression of ADPKD.   ',\n",
       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The overall hypothesis of the proposed studies is that an intensified interventional strategy aimed at blocking the renin angiotensin system at multiple levels (angiotensin II-receptor interaction by an angiotensin II AT1-receptor blocker or ARB, angiotensin II generation by an angiotensin I converting-enzyme inhibitor or ACEI, an angiotensin II AT1-receptor density and intracellular signaling by inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase or statin) will slow down the progression of the renal cystic disease in patients with normal or near-normal renal function (GFR > 60ml/min/1.73m2) and the decline of renal function in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (30-60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (Main Study) and that the success of this strategy will be predicted by the extent to which it corrects the intrarenal hemodynamic alterations associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (Pilot Study). The primary end-points for the Main Study will be a 15% increase in kidney volume or a 30% increase in cyst volume measured by MR in patients with normal or near-normal renal function and a 50% reduction in GFR or a doubling in serum creatinine in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. MR determinations of renal blood flow (RBF), renal vascular resistance (RVR) and arterial compliance will be obtained to ascertain the extent to which the hemodynamic changes in response to therapeutic interventions can predict their success in delaying the progression of the renal cystic disease or the decline of renal function. Similar methodology will be used to ascertain the potential value of novel antihypertensive therapies in ADPKD. The protocols for the Main Study will be conducted in 500 patients, 250 recruited at the Mayo Clinic, 150 recruited at KUMC, and 100 at the Cleveland Clinic. Approximately one-half of these patients will have normal or near-normal renal function and one-half have mild to moderate renal insufficiency. The protocols for the Pilot Study will be conducted only at the Mayo Clinic.   ',\n",
       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common lethal monogenetic disease, affecting 1/500 to 1/1000 of the US population. 50% of those affected with ADPKD will develop end-stage renal disease by the 6th decade of life. There are no proven therapies to slow the inexorable loss of kidney function in those with progressive disease. Interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been shown to reduce the progressive decline in renal function in both diabetic and non-diabetic kidney diseases, but it is unknown whether these results extend to ADPKD. Abundant evidence implicates angiotensin II in the pathogenesis of hypertension, but small single-center studies of limited duration have reported inconsistent results of ACE inhibitor (ACE-I) therapy on disease progression. This application is submitted in response to RFA DK-01-029 to establish a PKD Clinical Trials Network of clinical centers that will each enroll 500 ADPKD patients and conduct a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interruption of the RAAS on renal progression.   We have proposed a randomized, double-blinded trial to compare ACE-I vs. active control in hypertensive ADPKD patients with renal insufficiency (GFR 30-65 ml/min/1.73 m2) on the time to reach a composite outcome of doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD, or death. The Clinical Center will be based at the New England Medical Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The Principal and Co-Principal Investigators have had career-long interests in ADPKD and personally care for large numbers of ADPKD patients. We have identified 107 potentially eligible patients within our clinical sites. Additional strategies will be used to target patients locally and within contiguous New England States. Strong institutional support is available at the highest levels, including the General Clinical Research Centers at NEMC and BIDMC. As part of this RFA, we have proposed a pilot study to assess the safety of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition, which has been implicated in angiogenesis and cyst development in animal models of ADPKD. Thirty ADPKD patients with GFR >70 ml/min/1.73 m2 will be randomized to treatment with celecoxib vs. placebo and followed for 16 weeks. Change in GFR is the primary outcome measure and incidence of hyperkalemia, fluid retention, and elevated blood pressure will be assessed.   ',\n",

The work of the IBDGC and this GRC will enable us to identify important predisposing and disease modifying genes contributing to the pathogenesis of IBD which has the promise to: (1) identify persons at risk for disease, (2) predict disease course, (3) aid in selection of treatment, (4) understand pathophysiologic mechanisms such that novel preventive and therapeutic interventions can be developed. Advances in IBD gene identification and methodologic approaches may also be applicable to other complex genetic disorders.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This Research Plan is submitted in response to the RFA DK-06-504 for continuing the NIDDK Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IBDGC). This Master Application, submitted as a Data Coordinating Center application (DCC) from Yale University, describes prior research accomplishments, a prospective research plan, and the operational infrastructure of the entire IBDGC. This DCC application (Principal Investigator, PI: Judy H. Cho, M.D.) has been coordinated with Genetics Research Center (GRC) applications from the Cedars-Sinai Genetics Research Center (CSGRC), the Johns Hopkins Genetics Research Center (JHGRC), the University of Montreal Genetics Research Center (UMGRC), the University of Pittsburgh Genetics Research Center (UPGRC), the University of Toronto Genetics Research Center (UTGRC), and the Yale University Genetics Research Center (YUGRC). The central goal of this Consortium is to identify susceptibility genes contributing to the pathogenesis of IBD. This large challenge is optimally met through a Consortium structure due to synergy in a group with complementary skills, enhanced statistical power, ongoing NIH oversight and optimized quality control. The showpiece of the first funding period has been the identification of IL23R (interleukin-23 receptor) as a major susceptibility gene for IBD, highlighting the significant pathogenic role of genetic variation in IBD. Here, we propose to build on present progress to comprehensively define genetic contributions in IBD. Three specific aims include: 1) Expansion, Development and Management of Consortium Resources. Increased recruitment of key cohorts, including early-onset cases, will provide improved statistical power. 2) To employ a variety of approaches to identify genetic variation that contributes to IBD susceptibility. We provide a broad algorithm for follow-up of initial association signals. An ulcerative colitis genome-wide association study is proposed. 3) To build a risk model of IBD by understanding genetic influence on variations in phenotypic expressivity, gene pathway, and gene-gene (G x G) and gene-environmental (G x E) interactions. A basic model for identifying genetic predictors of phenotypic variability is provided. Specific stages of workup, optimally utilizing the strengths provided by uniform, well-powered, large Consortium-wide studies with the greater individualization and specialization of approaches achievable with GRC-led studies are described.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a complex genetic disorder with both genetic and environmental causes. The distribution of disease genes varies by ethnic ancestry. Despite the large African American (AA) population with IBD in North America, determination of genetic causes in this population is only in its infancy relative to that of white and even Asian populations. We have developed the largest cohort of AA IBD cases (presently 258 confirmed cases) and ethnically matched controls. These have been enrolled into the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Repository for broad use in future genetic studies. We have also analyzed the phenotype of IBD in the AA population and determined that the phenotype pattern is significantly different from that of IBD in the white population. However, we also found that IBD among AAs is frequently familial, suggesting that like the white population, there are underlying susceptibility genes. We found that unlike whites, NOD2 does not play a significant role in causing Crohn's disease in AAs. However we have replicated a significant role for the IBD5-OCTN1/2 haplotype. As predicted, linkage disequilibrium (LD) was greatly reduced for the AA population, suggesting that the IBD gene mapping in AA patients may allow more finite resolution in areas of high LD. Also, we found unique NOD2 polymorphisms suggesting that the greater genetic diversity within the AA population may provide greater knowledge of disease causing variations in the human genome. We now propose to enlarge the AA cohort to 800 cases and matched controls by year 5. Working with the consortiums DCC, we will perform a whole genome association study in Year 4, to identify IBD genes. We will also recruit an AA IBD replication population to confirm genetic findings from the GWA studies. We will use the larger population to determine the significance of unique African ancestral NOD2 variants, further reduce the IBD5 haplotype, determine the cause of IBD3 linkage and reduce its haplotype and test for association and identify unique African ancestral variants for any candidate genes identified in the white population by our NIDDK consortium collaborators.

Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two common chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, collectively known as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). It is estimated that as many as one million Americans are affected with these debilitating diseases. IBD may occur in people of all ages, but it is primarily a disease that arises in adolescents and young adults. Currently there is no known cure for IBD. Over the last five years, a number of IBD genes (CARD15, IBD5, MYO9B, and IL23R) have been identified, but these do not explain all of the genetic risk to IBD.

In order to meet this challenge, the NIDDK has supported the creation of the North American IBDGC. This Consortium consists of six GRCs and one data-coordinating center (DCC). The primary goals of this Consortium have been to collect a large and extremely well phenotyped cohort of IBD patients and matched controls and to apply the latest analytical and technological approaches for the discovery of risk factors that influence an individual's predisposition to developing CD or UC. The Universit[unreadable] de Montr[unreadable]al GRC (UMGRC) has played and will continue to play an important role in the recruitment of study subjects, collection of samples and information for the NIDDK public IBD repository, and will lead and participate in the studies aimed to: (1) identify genetic risk factors for IBD, (2) understand how these factors can lead to IBD, and (3) determine how this knowledge can improve clinical management of patients with these chronic diseases.

       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objective of this proposal is to contribute to the Biliary Atresia Research Consortium to assure its success in improving the understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, and disease mechanisms of biliary atresia and improving the clinical care, diagnosis and management of affected children. This is an important project because biliary atresia affects about 600 children each year in the US. Its cause is unknown. There are no good studies regarding early diagnosis or screening strategies, which are needed to improve patient care. The medical and surgical care of affected children is sub-optimal. Biliary atresia is the number one indication for pediatric liver transplantation, accounting for about 50% of cases in the US. The cost of care of this relatively rare disease is exorbitant. Better understanding of the disease should lead to improved care, better outcomes and reduced cost of care.   The specific aims of this proposal are #1 To participate fully as a clinical center in the Biliary Atresia Clinical Research Consortium. This entails participation in the development of the functions of the consortium, including determining data to be collected, projects to be undertaken and how information is to be disseminated; #2 To identify and enter into the consortium database all or nearly all of the cases of biliary atresia in the upper mid-west region over the five year period of the grant to determine the incidence of the disease and important epidemiological characteristics, such as racial/ethnic, socioeconomic and gender differences in incidence, secular trends, and temporal relationship to identifiable viral epidemics; #3 To examine prognostic indicators in a select cohort of biliary atresia patients.; and #4 To examine the hypothesis that biliary atresia is a viral-induced, immune mediated disease.',\n",
       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cadaveric liver transplantation is recognized as the optimal therapy for end stage liver disease, with marked improvement in results over the last two decades. With the increasing success of this treatment, the demand for suitable donor organs has also risen, resulting in a large discrepancy between the number of transplantable organs and the number of patients waiting. This imbalance has led to the development of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) as an additional method to increase organ supply. The exact indications for this procedure as well as long-term results and potential impact on the healthy donor are questions that remain unanswered. These issues form the basis for this research protocol, which proposes a longitudinal cohort study of live donor liver transplant recipients and their donors across eight transplant centers with an extended period of follow-up. The aims of this cohort study will be the formation of a core database containing information collected pre-transplant, intraoperatively and post-transplant. At least 250 living liver donor/recipient pairs and an equal or greater number of cadaveric recipients will be followed for a minimum of two years to provide critically needed information on the safety and efficacy of living donor liver transplantation, the potential impact on disease progression and recurrence, and ultimately to better define the specific role of living donor liver transplantation in the management of end stage liver disease.In addition to core data collection, this cohort study will offer an opportunity to address specific research questions unique to the setting of LDLT. The first project focuses on patients with hepatitis C, the most common indication for transplantation in the U.S. The kinetics of recurrent hepatitis C viral load post-transplantation will be compared in living donor and matched cadaveric recipients, and the effect of pre-transplant interferon treatment on the tempo and severity of recurrence evaluated. The second project focuses on optimization of pain control in living donors, comparing the use of preemptive thoracic epidural catheter analgesia delivery with patient controlled intravenous analgesia, and using pain scores and quality of life instruments to evaluate the impact of these treatments on long and short-term outcomes.We anticipate that the study will provide the necessary information to aid physicians in the counseling of patients regarding transplant options, and help prospective donors and recipients to better understand the risks and benefits of the procedure. Additionally, the information gained through this cohort study can be expected to impact the entire living donor transplantation procedure itself, by identifying factors that can be modified pre-transplantation, intraoperativiely, and post-transplantation to improve donor and recipient outcomes.',\n",

       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Biliary atresia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from pediatric liver disease and it is the most common indication for pediatric liver transplantation. Despite its clinical importance, little is known of a wide range of fundamental issues regarding biliary atresia. Viral and genetic causes of biliary atresia have been explored, yet its etiology remains fundamentally unknown. A lack of prospective clinical follow-up of children with biliary atresia has resulted in a relative poor understanding of its natural history. Evidence based approaches to the medical and surgical management of biliary atresia do not exist, in large part due to an absence of prospective multi-centered studies. The Biliary Atresia Clinical Research Consortium is an outstanding mechanism for advancing the study of biliary atresia. Its concept is based upon the hypothesis that support of an international multi-centered research consortium of biliary atresia will permit valid studies of the etiology, natural history and treatment of biliary atresia. The Mount Sinai Biliary Atresia Study Group will consist of a pre-existing clinical consortium of twelve centers located in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Puerto Rico. This study group proposes the following three specific aims for the Biliary Atresia Clinical Research Consortium:   Aim 1: Establishment of a biliary atresia database and serum/tissue bank:A prospectively collected clinical database and bank of serum and tissues from children with neonatal cholestasis is of absolute critical importance to advancing our understanding of biliary atresia.   Aim 2. Prospective analysis of children with biliary atresia without a hepatoportoenterostomy or with a failed hepatoportoenterostomy:Prospective analysis of these patients will be performed in order to determine the reasons for these failures and to determine the optimal approach to their liver transplantation.   Aim 3. Randomized trial of beta-blockade in the prevention of complications of portal hypertension in children with EHBA.Infants between 6 and 9 months of age will be randomized to receive beta-blocker therapy or placebo and complications of portal hypertension will be assessed prospectively.',\n",
       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The creation of a multi-center collaborative consortium provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve the lives of children with neonatal liver disease. This Clinical Center application from four pediatric medical centers describes the collective clinical expertise, collaborative research experience, and outstanding institutional core facilities needed to be productive contributing members to this consortium. This application proposes participation in the consortium in three ways:   1. Clinical Data Collection: A uniform, concise data form and electronic collection system will be developed to manage clinical data. Relevant clinical data and tissue specimens will be contributed to the Consortium. The two research programs and four clinical programs collaborating in this proposal can contribute data from approximately 25 new patients with biliary atresia (BA)/year and 12 patients with neonatal hepatitis (NH)/yr.   2. Short-term study: Using available and accumulated specimens, we will study the pathogenesis, natural history, and clinical correlates of hepatic fibrogenesis in patients with biliary atresia and NH. A variation of the Knodell hepatic fibrosis scale will be used to determine the extent of hepatic fibrosis at the time of the Kasai procedure. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization techniques will be used to quantify the expression of specific molecular markers of hepatic fibrosis and inflammation. The severity of fibrosis or specific staining patterns will be correllated with patient diagnosis and response to the Kasai procedure.   3. Long-term study: To identify patterns of protein and gene expression that are unique to biliary atresia or that predict response to the Kasai procedure, gene expression profiles will be determined in wedge liver biopsies as well as in hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM). Modern proteomic techniques will also be applied to serum samples to identify proteins synthesized and released by the injured liver. Similar to the genetic profile, the pattern of proteins will be correlated with clinical data to identify patterns of serum proteins that are disease specific or predict prognosis.',\n",
       " \" DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Biliary atresia and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis are two cholestatic disorders occurring in the first 3 months of life that account for 60-70% of all infants with neonatal cholestasis, which have similar clinical presentations but disparate outcomes. Diagnosis of biliary atresia is frequently delayed; the Kasai portoenterostomy procedure may extend an infant's life, but in most cases is not curative. Thus liver transplantation becomes necessary in 70% of infants with biliary atresia in North America, accounting for 40-50% of all pediatric liver transplants. In idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, on the other hand, recovery occurs in 80% of patients with supportive care alone. The etiology and pathogenesis of these two disorders is currently poorly understood; consequently few effective therapies have been developed over the past three decades.   The development of new therapeutic strategies will require a thorough understanding of the causes and mechanisms of tissue injury in these disorders. Because both these disorders are rare, a network of centers will be essential to achieve effective investigation. Consequently, the objective of this grant application is to be chosen as one of the Clinical Centers in the Biliary Atresia Clinical Research Consortium and participate in all investigations initiated by this consortium. We specifically will test the hypothesis that perinatal/acquired cases of biliary atresia and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis are distinct phenotypes caused by similar viral-induced immune injury of extrahepatic and entrahepatic bile ducts and hepatocytes in the genetically and immunologically susceptible infant. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To develop a database and tissue/serum bank of human specimens from infants with biliary atresia, idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, and appropriate control cholestatic and non-cholestatic infants, in order to define the natural history and better understand the pathogenesis of these disorders. (2) To determine the role of specific viral infections in the etiology of biliary atresia and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis. (3) To conduct a Phase I/Phase II study of treatment with an antioxidant solution designed to reduce injury, and ultimately fibrosis, in infants with biliary atresia. Our Center has extensive experience in clinical care, investigation, and development of novel therapies for biliary atresia and related cholestatic disorders, and is committed to the scientific development of and participation in clinical investigations and trials initiated by the Biliary Atresia Clinical Research Consortium.\",\n",

CHP is the only tertiary pediatric medical center in Western Pennsylvania and has played a pioneering role in the development of liver transplantation for children for well over two decades. The program has cared for more than 60 patients with biliary atresia (BA) and more than 125 patients with neonatal hepatitis over the last five years. The proposal will utilize the resources available from the NIH-funded Pediatric G-CRC at CHP, the Starzl Transplantation Institute, the Office of Clinical Research within the School of Medicine of the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), as well as, the extensive expertise for conducting collaborative clinical research programs within the School of Public Health at Pitt. We will examine the hypothesis that BA is the phenotype of several underlying disorders by proposing a large-scale database to identify subgroups within a rigorously characterized population of BA patients. Second, we propose a short-term project to screen for mutations in the human orthologue of the human inv gene in a subgroup of patients with BA who also have anomalies of visceral organ situs determination. This project has the potential to identify a genetic mechanism for abnormal morphogenesis of the hepatobiliary system and a diagnostic marker for a subgroup of BA patients. Third, we propose a longer-term project using gene chip analysis of several novel model systems to identify hepatic genes for which expression is specifically altered in BA. This third project is designed to identify new diagnostic and/or prognostic markers and to provide leads for further basic research on the pathobiology of BA.\",\n",
       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The shortage of available cadaver organs has prompted the transplant community to consider living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) as an effective alternative to cadaveric liver transplantation (CLT). The potential limitations of LDLT consist primarily of 1) the potential risk to an otherwise healthy donor, and 2) the uncertainty regarding graft and patient outcomes for LDLT as compared to CLT. The core project of this proposal will compare outcomes for recipients of LDLT to those of CLT, while addressing the potential complications to living donors. In addition, we propose to analyze two separate issues. First, we will evaluate donor hepatic steatosis in both LDLT and CLT. We will compare novel non-invasive measurements of steatosis in living donors with the current gold standard, a liver biopsy. We will compare the results of transplanting steatotic livers from living and cadaveric donors, assessing graft and patient outcomes in both groups. We will also evaluate the role of hepatic steatosis on liver regeneration in both the living donor and recipient. We hypothesize that outcome of transplantation in steatotic livers of LDLT is superior to results obtained in steatotic CLT recipients. This first aim will help design a decision algorithm for the use of steatotic livers in both CLT and LDLT while validating non-invasive measurements of hepatic steatosis. Second, we propose to address the potential role for LDLT in the multimodal management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Given the lack of randomized trials and large case series, this issue has been recently addressed in studies utilizing decision-modeling analysis. This second aim will provide clinical data to validate these studies, and will compare CLT, with its inherent waiting times, to LDLT, a strategy that theoretically eliminates waiting times. We hypothesize that the outcome of transplantation of HCC in LDLT is superior to results obtained with CLT. In the aggregate, these studies will define the efficacy of LDLT in the US, while a focus on both a donor issue (hepatic steatosis) and a recipient issue (the special problem of HCC) will help delineate the potential advantages of LDLT over CLT.',\n",

       " \" DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biliary atresia (BA) is a disease of unknown etiology that, if undiagnosed leads almost universally to death. Even with diagnosis and appropriate treatment, there is tremendous morbidity associated with BA. There are 250-400 patients diagnosed annually with this disorder in the United States. Approximately 60-80% of these patients will develop end-stage liver disease, and will require liver transplantation. Currently, BA is the main indication for liver transplantation in children in the United States. The lack of a nationwide network to study and treat these patients significantly impairs clinical and research advancements, since each individual center sees relatively few BA patients. As a consequence, there are few data about basic issues, which could fundamentally change the outcome for these patients, e.g., etiology, diagnostic techniques, medical and surgical management, and post-transplantation therapy. The formation of a nationwide Biliary Atresia Clinical Research Consortium (BACRC) will allow such data to be collected, leading to improved outcomes for BA patients nationwide. At the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH), the largest pediatric hospital in the United States, we propose to use the resources of the institution and the dedicated Texas Children's Liver Center to enroll and care for patients in the BACRC. The Texas Children's Liver Center provides a full-service and coordinated approach to the care of children with liver disease, by synthesizing the involvement of medical, surgical, and transplant personnel. There are 3 areas of need of BA patients that the Texas Children's Liver Center proposes to address in this application: 1.) develop a database to gather relevant patient data and enhance participation in the BACRC;2.) explore an underlying etiology of BA by determining if BA patients with laterality defects have mutations in the lnversin (Invs) gene; and 3.) explore a novel treatment involving infusion of patient-derived cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cell lines directed against Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) for the most devastating of post-transplant outcomes that preferentially occurs in pediatric transplant recipients: Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD). Autologous infusion of EBV-specific CTL lines may restore the natural balance of immunomodulation of EBV-transformed B cells that is suppressed by the inherent nature of current T-cell based immunosuppression. An IRB, FDA, and NIH-approved protocol for this therapy is currently in place at the TCH and involves the support of the General Clinical Research Center.    It is only by engaging in a nationwide multi-institutional approach that we can begin to discover information to understand and treat patients with life-long needs like BA.   \",\n",

Progress in the care of Biliary Atresia and Neonatal Hepatitis is hampered by many factors including the difficulty in recruiting adequate numbers of children with these diagnoses at a single center, diversity of conditions that are all labeled neonatal hepatitis and the absence of a national database. There are few efforts at collaboration in pediatric liver research at the national level, unlike that instituted to accelerate the pace of progress in pediatric cancer or AIDS. Success in addressing these problems through a national collaborative network will depend on the scientific leadership and operational performance of the centers involved in the Consortium. Our proposal is composed of four sections. Section I: A description of the facilities, resources and participation of the team of physicians and scientists at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania. Section II: A strategy and description of the development of a comprehensive database. Section III: A three-year research protocol to identify therapy to improve growth in children with Biliary Atresia. Section IV: A one-year research protocol to examine Jagged 1 as a modifier gene in children with Biliary Atresia.

       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has been widely accepted for the transplantation of children with excellent results in the recipient, and a track record of donor safety that approaches renal donation. In the face of a progressive scarcity of cadaver donors, LDLT has been extended to adults and proliferated rapidly over the last 4 years. This operation requires a more extensive hepatectomy and thus an increased risk to the donor which has not been adequately quantified. The combination of uncertain donor risk and unregulated proliferation has led to cries of alarm in both the scientific literature and the lay press. The current study will provide a structured response to these concerns and an opportunity to address fascinating biological questions inherent to this procedure.   Our interest in LDLT spans nearly two decades across a broad range of surgical and medical issues. The liver transplant program in our center was constituted from the outset with the expectation that LDLT would be a significant proportion of our transplants because of the enormous waiting list in New York State. Currently LDLT accounts for nearly 1/3 of adult transplants in our center; we will perform 30 this year with continued anticipated growth in the next 5 years. Our team is broadly constituted and exceptionally capable of addressing a range of issues pertaining to structured health assessment of donor outcomes, medical indications and application of LDLT as well as surgical and biological questions. We have particular strength in epidemiology, virology, and immunology, in addition to transplant hepatology and surgery. While we recognize that a broad range of surgical questions will need to be addressed, we find two issues specific to LDLT related to the central theme of regeneration of the allograft most compelling; first, the pathophysiology and possible treatment of failure of regeneration in the recipient, ie. \"small-for-size syndrome\", and second, the risk of early and more severe recurrence of hepatitis C in a regenerating liver graft. The central theme of regeneration pervades LDLT, and likely hinges on inflammatory injury. Our collaborative partners, Charles Rice of the New York-Presbyterian Center for the Study of Hepatitis C and Manikkan Suthanthiran in the Transplantation Medicine program position us to test our hypotheses using novel techniques for the assessment of inflammatory cytokines and viral reinfection on the cellular level.

       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):As the disparity between number of potential liver transplant recipients and available cadaveric organs has widened, novel approaches have been developed to permit the successful transplantation of the largest possible number of patients with end-stage liver disease. The most promising of these strategies has involved the application of adult to adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). More than fifteen U.S. transplant centers have now utilized LDLT as a standard method for liver replacement. Despite the increasingly widespread application of this approach, considerable heterogeneity exists between centers regarding donor and recipient evaluation as well as the surgical techniques employed. Moreover, information is lacking regarding outcomes of this procedure for both donor and recipient, no data available to identify donors or recipients who may benefit most (or least) from this procedure, and no data to determine whether using LDLT is a cost-effective strategy. In this setting, we propose to participate as a transplant center (TC) in the LDLT Clinical Research Consortium. In this role, we propose to participate in the development of a prospective comprehensive data base and information core that will permit the dissection of the factors which lead to favorable, or unfavorable, outcomes in LDLT as compared to standard cadaveric transplantation. The existing UVA STRANDS database will permit retrospective collection of data from LDLT and cadaveric transplants performed over the last 5 years. In addition, the TC proposes to build on its institutional strengths to lead two clinical research protocols. The first protocol will develop a Cost Utility Decision Analysis using the Adult to Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort. This research will yield a valid decision analysis model that can be used in a general patient population to better define subpopulations that would benefit from LDLT as opposed to cadaveric liver transplant. Costs and utilities to the health care system and the patients involved will be clarified for use in patient counseling, medical decision-making, and policy formulation. The second clinical research proposal will examine the outcomes of LDLT in patients infected with hepatitis C and compare these outcomes to cadaveric controls. Mechanisms that contribute to rapid allograft infection and injury will be examined including hepatocyte infection, rates of viral replication and kinetics of serum viral clearance.',\n",

       " \" DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The aim of this proposal is to demonstrate that the group of physicians and scientists at the Liver Transplant Program of the University of Pennsylvania has the interest, infrastructure and resources to participate in the Living Donor Liver Transplantation (LDLT) Cohort Study among adults awaiting transplantation. Progress in the care of patients suffering from end stage liver disease has been hampered by the limited availability of donor organs for transplantation. Adult to adult LDLT is expected to significantly expand the donor pool and provide numerous organs to be transplanted into designated recipients. The initial results are encouraging, however, there are many questions related to donor and recipient outcomes and whether better management of these patients can improve these results.A prospective mutli-center study of LDLT in the adult setting is expected to: 1. Collect and analyze data that will assist in the establishment of reliable criteria for donor selection, examine operative techniques that are associated with the best short and long term outcomes, and recommend methods for long-term follow up of the donor's physical and psychosocial well being. 2. Determine recipient outcomes when compared to the cadaveric setting and study whether results are affected by preoperative selection and preparation, operative techniques, and the interrelationship between regeneration and immune response. 3. Study the effects of LDLT on clinical practice and socioeconomic issues in transplantation. Success in addressing these problems through a national collaborative network will depend on the scientific and operational performance of the centers involved in the consortium. The Penn Transplant center is committed to participate in these collaborative efforts, and contribute to the research efforts that are aimed at better understanding of medical and surgical issues of LDLT.Our proposal is divided into three sections. Section one: A description of the resources and participation of the team of physicians at Penn Transplant Center. Section two: A description and strategy for the development of a comprehensive database. Section three: Two research proposals describing a four year research effort to identify: a. the interrelationship between the regenerative process, graft function, alloimmune response. and b. the biopsychosocial impact of LDLT on donors and recipients.\",\n",
       " \" DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The overall objective of this proposal is to establish a Clinical Research Consortium to define the outcomes of ALDLT. We propose the following specific aims to fully evaluate the impact of ALDLT: 1. Core Study: Establish a Donor and Recipient Core Information Database for Adult LDLT and Non-ALDLT Patients Hypothesis: ALDLT short-term survival outcomes, but not complication rates, are equivalent to whole cadaveric and SLT transplantation. We and others, achieved excellent short-tem survival outcomes of ALDLT, despite a high rate of recipient complications, in non-urgent patients. To fully evaluate the benefits of ALDLT, the technique will be applied to both urgent and non-urgent recipients, and compare its outcomes to three sets of patient cohorts that include: a) whole organ recipients, b) cadaveric SLT recipients, and c) candidates who ultimately do not receive a transplant. The living donor section will compare living donors and potential donors who do not undergo donation. Primary endpoints define survival outcomes and complication rates in donors and recipients at 1, 2 and 3 years posttransplantation. This will elucidate the efficacy of ALDLT as compared to whole cadaveric, SLT, and control (untransplanted) patients in the entire spectrum of recipients' status, and determine if ALDLT is justified when compared to the natural history of non-transplanted non-urgent controls. Secondary endpoints assess the impact of technical variations on postoperative recovery, liver regeneration postdonation, impact of living donation on the cadaveric donor pool, and defines donor exclusion criteria.2. Clinical Research Protocol for Recipient Outcome: Determine the impact of ALDLT on Posttransplant HCV Recurrence in Transplant Recipients Hypothesis: ALDLT may be accompanied by accelerated recurrence of HCV versus whole cadaveric liver transplantation. Rapid and severe HCV recurrence observed, at our center, in ALDLT recipients compared to whole organ transplant patients, may offset the benefits of early transplantation with living donors. This protocol compares the time to histological recurrence of HCV in ALDLT and whole organ graft recipients at 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years posttransplantation. The effects on patient and graft survival and the correlation between the degree of histological disease and HCV RNA levels are investigated by our secondary endpoints.3. Clinical Research Protocol for Donor Outcome: Determine Health-Related Quality of Life Outcomes and Resource Utilization of Adult Living Donation Hypothesis: HRQL of living donors is impacted in the short-, but not, the long-term and the HRQL of ALDLT recipients may be enhanced following ALDLT. HRQL in both donors and recipients will be compared before ALDLT and at 6 and 12 months posttransplantation through generic and disease-specific instruments. Additionally, health utility index assessments and evaluation of health care resource utilization will be conducted.\",\n",

       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   We propose to develop a Biliary Atresia Clinical Center to perform translational research focused on diagnosis, pathogenesis, and novel therapeutic modalities for biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis. These disorders are the main causes of neonatal cholestasis, with biliary atresia accounting for -50% of the indications for liver transplantation in children. The application is a logical extension of the long-standing mission of the applicant Center to provide exceptional care to any child with liver disease through comprehensive care and research. To pursue this mission, a clinical service focused exclusively on pediatric liver disease was created in 1985; since, then, we have served as a referral center for regional medical groups and institutions. We also performed clinical and patient-directed laboratory research to define specific causes of neonatal hepatitis and to explore novel therapeutic modalities for affected infants. Recently, we applied functional genomics to identify immunologic pathways that may regulate pathogenesis of biliary atresia. Despite these accomplishments, we recognize that further advances will depend directly on the access to a large patient population in a prospective manner for adequately powered studies. Therefore, we set two goals for the applicant Center: 1) to establish and maintain the infrastructure of a Clinical Center that will work in collaboration with other centers of the Biliary Atresia Clinical Research Consortium, and 2) to actively use the resources provided by the consortium to carry out studies on children with biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis. To accomplish these goals, we propose an administrative structure jointly shared by medical and surgical faculty of the Center, a network of regional collaborators that will assure access to patients, and a database to gather clinical and laboratory information based on the natural history of biliary atresia. Using a model of translational research that is focused on the child with biliary atresia, we propose two studies to be carried with the approval by the Research Consortium. The first is a short-term study applying basic science technology to further defines the pathogenesis of this disease. The second is a 3-year open-label randomized study to establish the efficacy of corticosteroids in improving biliary flow following surgical portoenterostomy in infants with biliary atresia. Execution of these studies and access to a critical amount of clinical information and serum/tissues will facilitate research and generate hypotheses on pathogenesis and optimal treatment for children with biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis.',\n",

       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Two forms of biliary atresia have been recognized. The embryonic or fetal type is often associated with congenital malformations suggesting the insult occurs prenatally. The more common perinatal type usually presents at 4-8 weeks of life. Because the disease occurs so early in the perinatal period, a genetic factor being causal or contributory must be considered. Previous data has been conflicting; there are case reports of biliary atresia occurring in families and HLA identical twins that are discordant for biliary atresia. In one study, HLA-B 12 was found more commonly then expected in children with biliary atresia. HLA-Cw4/7 has also been increased in children with biliary atresia and in adults with primary sclerosing cholangitis. However, all these studies suffer from the small number of subjects and single-center studies. The etiologic mechanism(s) for biliary atresia remain enigmatic. By analyzing HLA types in a large cohort of children with biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis, determination of any genetic predisposition to these disorders should be accelerated. Biliary atresia remains the leading indication for pediatric liver transplantation in the United States. Recently, the Pediatric Liver Disease Severity Score (PELD) was proposed to improve organ allocation for children in need of liver transplants. The major limitation of the PELD score is that it has not been prospectively validated. However, the PELD score is based on only a few variables that can be objectively assessed and are reproducible. No individual center has sufficient patients with biliary atresia or neonatal hepatitis to ascertain whether the PELD score can predict outcomes prospectively. This proposal brings together a unique consortium of investigators and resources within the State of California with a plan for a participating Clinical Center in the Biliary Atresia Clinical Research Consortium. Our research plan describes the establishment of a large multicomponent Clinical Center patient database that would contribute to the proposed multicenter Biliary Atresia Clinical Research Consortium. These include tertiary care referral specialty clinics at a large university medical center and an HMO patient population. We propose to identify patients with biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis from these sources, to allow participation in the Consortium. Secondly, we propose two research protocols that would use the Biliary Atresia Clinical Research Consortium to explore a possible etiologic relationship between HLA type and biliary atresia and allow a prospective evaluation of the PELD score.',\n",
       " ' DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple lines of evidence have suggested that viral infection may play a pathogenetic role in biliary atresia (BA). However, searches for putative viral pathogens have been restricted to a small number of selected viruses and have not focused on virus-specific immune responses. The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that viral infection plays an etiopathologic role in biliary atresia. The purpose of the present proposal is three-fold: 1) Establish a Clinical Biliary Atresia Center. Five referral centers including the Johns Hopkins Pediatric Liver Center will recruit 10-20 new BA patients/year to add to the 73 BA patients in the present database. The database will gather demographic and clinical information as well as biological specimens pertinent to the viral infection hypothesis. 2) BA Peptide Project, (3-years) will employ a powerful new technique, bacteriophage peptide display, to search for novel antigenic epitopes specific to BA. BA sera will be utilized to \"biopan\" random peptide libraries to identify epitopes not recognized by control sera. One patient/control group from each of the Clinical Centers will be studied, for the greatest possible geographic, seasonal, and ethnic diversity. \"BA peptides\" will be sequenced and synthesized. Peptides will be used to immunoaffinity purify the corresponding monospecific antibodies from BA sera. Protein databases will be searched for homologous viral proteins. To determine if the BA peptides exhibit cross reactivity as HLA-A2+ restricted T cell epitopes, the peptides will be incubated with dendritic cells, antigen-presenting cells (APC) harvested from HLA-A2+ maternal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Maternal PBL will be incubated with the peptide-pulsed APC to identify peptide-specific CTL using target cell lysis assays. 3) The BA-Dimer Project, (1-year) will employ a sensitive new \"dimer\" technique to determine if HLA-A2+ biological mothers of BA (MBA) patients exhibit unique peptide-specific CTL. The dimer technique uses immunoglobulin as a molecular scaffold to produce a divalent peptide-HLA-A2-Ig complex. Dimers will be loaded with BA or homologous viral peptides and PBL from MBA and control mothers from each Clinical Center will be tested for dimer reactivity using FACS analysis. Novel BA-specific peptides, monospecific antibodies, and BA-dimers could be used for early diagnosis, identification of cellular targets and intrahepatic T cells.  ',\n",
       " \" DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The Liver Transplant Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) is a well-established and vitally important regional resource. This application proposes a multi-center cooperative core study in which a well-defined cohort from UNC-CH and other Transplant Centers (TC) will be followed prospectively to provide reliable, complete, and generalizable information on adult donor and recipient outcomes for both living donor and cadaveric liver transplants. A database structure and information core is proposed, and this application discusses the relevance of each proposed data element. This core study will be augmented by analysis of our historical cohort for which existing outcome data can be pooled across all the Transplant Centers (TC) participating in the Clinical Research Consortium. In addition to these studies, this application proposes two common protocols. The first will examine in-depth the short and long-term morbidity and quality of life of living donors. The second will examine differences in drug metabolism and immunosuppressive regimen between recipients of living donor and cadaveric liver transplants. UNC-CH is well qualified to be a Transplant Center (TC) within the Clinical Research Consortium having performed 13 LDLT in the last 18 months and 21 LDLT total. Projections for UNC-CH are 50-60 CADLT and 15-20 LDLT per year, thereby allowing accrual and followup of more than sufficient numbers of patients to contribute to the Consortium studies. Overall one-year patient and graft survival for both CADLT and LDLT are 90-95% and 77-85% respectively. The UNC-CH infrastructure includes 4 transplant surgeons, 5 hepatologists, and other relevant professionals in vascular surgery, anesthesiology, radiology and vascular/interventional radiology, immunology, infectious disease, pulmonary disease, pathology, pharmacy, nursing, blood bank, psychiatry or psychology and social services. All studies benefit from use of the Verne Caviness General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) as a primary site and collaboration with the Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease (CGIBD). Particularly relevant to this application are the GCRC's Informatics Services and the epidemiologic services of the CGIBD.As a Transplant Center, UNC-CH is committed to close collaborations including membership on the Steering Committee. UNC-CH has participated in multiple multi-center trials and has a rich experiential base in working with data coordinating centers. Our application's strong institutional support for participation as a TC includes acceptance of per patient funding mechanisms for the common protocols.\",\n",

Individuals interested in becoming living donors will be asked to participate in this study. Those who are selected and undergo the surgical procedure will be followed at periodic intervals to define the long term morbidity and mortality of the procedure. Individuals not selected as living donors will be matched to the actual donors 2:1 by age, race and gender and also followed prospectively as a donor control group.

A careful evaluation of LDLT is necessary because of the potential impact of this procedure on liver transplantation. The LDLT Cohort Study is a multi-center  controlled study designed to measure the outcomes of donors and recipients of LDLT.

       " \"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a progressive scarring disorder that causes proteinuria and kidney failure in the majority of affected individuals. There is considerable controversy regarding the best therapeutic intervention and the definition of pathological variants of FSGS that may impact therapeutic response rates. This proposal focuses on the design and conduct of a collaborative multicenter trial that will evaluate response rates of children and young adults with the nephrotic syndrome due to FSGS treated with cyclosporin A as compared to corticosteroids plus angiotensin receptor blocker therapy. It will utilize a newly determined FSGS classification scheme as defined by the NY Pathology Consensus Group that includes one of our collaborators. In addition, since incidence of idiopathic FSGS has been increasing over the past 2 decades, a case-control study that will evaluate risk factors for FSGS is proposed to run concurrently with the trial.   Our proposed southeastern clinical coordinating center will provide strength to the planned nation-wide trial through our large patient population with FSGS, the strength of the UNC nephropathology service, and the investigators' long track record of clinical trial and epidemiologic research in glomerular diseases through the UNC-Chapel Hill based Glomerular Disease Collaborative Network. In conjunction with committed collaborating sites, our group has over 400 FSGS patients who would be eligible for the proposed trial, as well as established mechanisms for including prospectively identified patients. The proposed case-control study will evaluate risk factors for the development of FSGS such as body mass, birth weight, viral illnesses and smoking in all patients screened for entry into the trial.      \",\n",

Based on this assessment, a protocol for a randomized trial is proposed, and procedures for the DCC's responsibilities in the implementation of the trial are presented.   In the planning phase (Phase I), the DCC will work with four Regional Clinical Coordinating Centers (RCCCs) to design and develop a protocol for the trial. Each RCC will oversee several local Clinical Centers (CCs). Systems for data acquisition (via a secure web-based data entry) and data management will be established. The DCC will develop procedures to enhance the quality and completeness of the data collected, including a detailed Manual of Operations describing data collection and other procedures for the RCCCs and CCs. The randomization schedule for entering patients will be generated. The DCC will provide centralized training of study personnel on entry of trial patients, completion of trial forms, and use of the data management system. The DCC will arrange and actively participate in meetings and conference calls of the Steering Committee and its subcommittees.   A major function of the DCC during the Recruitment and Follow-Up (Phase II) of the trial will be to monitor recruitment, retention, and adherence to the protocol. The database management system developed in Phase I will be used to assure accurate and complete collection of trial data. An inquiry system will be used to resolve data discrepancies. Trial progress will be reported in monthly reports to the RCCCs, and in reports to the Steering Committee and Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Statistical and interim analyses will be performed with final analyses completed and reported in Phase III. The DCC will develop new statistical methodology as needed to properly analyze the data.   Since the FSGS Trial is a multi-centered effort, the DCC will provide leadership to coordinate the trial design and study conduct. The DCC will work to foster a spirit of cooperation which is important to the project.\",\n",
       " \"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The purpose of this request is to establish a cooperative group of approximately 10 prostate evaluation and treatment centers nationwide which will develop and conduct a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial to determine whether Saw Palmetto(SP) and/or Pygeum Africanum(AP) can prevent the clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).      BPH is a common disease in men over 50 which can lead to bothersome voiding symptoms, urinary retention, permanent bladder damage, renal failure, urinary tract infections, urosepsis or urinary incontinence. Treatment options with documented efficacy include medication, several thermotherapy options, and surgical prostatectomy.      Phytotherapy is another treatment option for BPH which is used widely in Europe and is experiencing increasing utilization in the United States. Two common phytotherapeutic agents SP and PA. Despite the widespread use of these substances, there is no convincing data in the literature which demonstrates efficacy for the treatment of BPH. These phytotherapeutic substances do appear to be safe from the patients' perspective.      The objective of this trial is to determine if SP and/or PA can prevent the clinical progression of BPH, as defined by the development of: acute urinary retention, renal insufficiency due to BPH, recurrent urinary tract infections, urinary incontinence, or an increase in the international prostate symptom score (IPSS) of 4 or more points over a four year trial. Parameters to be assessed in the subjects enrolled in this trial include IPSS, peak urinary flow rate, post void residual volumes, quality of life and sexual health questionnaires, prostate size determined by prostatic ultrasound, blood count and blood chemistries, urinalysis, serum hormone levels, a history and physical examination. Patients will be assessed every 3 months over a four year trial period.      The chosen group of collaborators will meet to design the protocol including diagnostic criteria, inclusion/exclusion criteria, safety measurements and quality of life outcome measurements. The trial will commence after the protocol has been developed, an operations manual has been completed and data collection techniques have been established. Each site will obtain IRB approval of the final protocol. When the study is complete and the data has been analyzed, publication of relevent results will be done.\",\n",
       " \"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The use of herbal extracts for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is growing rapidly in the United States. Numerous small clinical studies, carried out primarily in Europe, suggest that some of these extracts have great potential for providing relief of symptoms and, possibly, altering the natural course of BPH. The size and quality of prior studies, however, make it impossible to provide firm evidence-based recommendations to patients; the need for higher-quality, longer-term studies is compelling.      This proposal describes plans to establish a Clinical Evaluation and Treatment Center in response to RFA # DK-02-026. We plan to bring the substantial patient population and scientific resources of the Northern California Kaiser-Permanente (NCKP) Division of Research (DOR) to support the successful completion of this important multicenter randomized clinical trial. While the final details of the research protocol will be established by the trial's Steering and Planning Committee, the approach described in this proposal is based on prior successful trials of BPH therapeutics and an ongoing NIH-funded randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of saw palmetto currently being conducted by our group.      Participants will be recruited from five NCKP clinical facilities, which serve over 100,000 men aged 50 and older who are unlikely to meet exclusion criteria. Entry criteria include male participants at least 50 years old with an American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUASI) Score >7, no prior history of prostate cancer or prostate surgery, PSA below the age-adjusted upper limit (or PSA<10 with negative prostate biopsy), and creatinine<2.0mg/dl. Patients on current medical therapy will undergo a wash-out phase prior to final eligibility determination. Eligible patients will undergo a one-month single-blind run-in period; those demonstrating adequate adherence will be randomized in equal proportions to saw palmetto, pygeum, or placebo.      Patients will be followed at four-month intervals for a period of four-to-six years. Primary endpoints are those specified in the RFA (acute urinary retention, BPH-related renal insufficiency, recurrent urinary tract infections, incontinence, and an increase of at least 4 points in the AUASI); secondary endpoints include symptom scores, uroflow measurements, and adverse effects. A systematic, multifaceted approach will be used to promote participant adherence to the study protocol.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Serenoa repens (saw palmetto) and Pygeum africanum appear to have modest benefit on the pathophysiology of established benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) but even more importantly these agents may affect the pathogenesis of the progressive disease process. Almost every individual study, systematic review and meta-analysis report analyzing the effect of these phytotherapeutic agents on BPH have come to the same conclusion: further research is needed to determine the long term safety and effectiveness and ability to prevent complications associated with progressive BPH. The primary objective of this study is to determine if serenoa repens or pygeum africanum delays or prevents clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia compared to placebo treatment. Secondary objectives will compare relative efficacy of these two treatments and also determine whether either of these agents ameliorate symptoms of BPH, improve BPH specific quality of life, improve maximum flow rate and reduce residual urine in men with BPH. Men with mild to moderate symptoms of BPH who do not desire or require immediate medical or surgical treatment will be randomized to placebo, serenoa repens or pygeum africanum after placebo run in and will be followed for disease progression for a minimum of four years. Progression will be defined as an increase in AUA symptom score of 4 or more points from baseline, or occurrence of any of the following complications of BPH; acute urinary retention, incontinence, obstructive uropathy (measured as increased creatinine) or BPH related urinary tract infection. The Canadian BPH Research Group (Canadian CETC) have demonstrated experience and expertise in designing and implementing multi-center clinical trials in BPH and are the most successful research group in Canada in recruiting patients to multi-center BPH trials. The principal investigator has been a successful and effective collaborator in studies funded by NIH-NIDDK. The members of this group have demonstrated their willingness and ability to work in an effective and congenial manner in collaborative international multi-center studies including NIH sponsored collaborative groups. The Canadian BPH study group would be a valuable partner in the proposed NIH phytotherapeutic BPH prevention trial.',\n",

       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common affliction of men over the age of 50. There has been a rapid increase in the use of alternative therapies and specifically, phytotherapuetic agents, to treat BPH. Published studies have focused on the relative efficacy, i.e. symptoms, urinary flow rate and nocturia and side effect profile of these therapies. To date, there have been no studies which have described the natural history of BPH progression in those who are treated with phytotherapeutic agents such as Serenoa repens (Saw palmetto berry) or Pygeurn africanum (African plum tree). Moreover, the natural history of BPH in various age and ethnic groups have been poorly characterized.      The Prostate Canter and the The Center for Holistic Urology at The New York Presbyterian Hospital evaluates and treats an ethnically diverse group of more than 3,200 men per year with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH. It is well positioned to meet the recruitment and patient retention goals as a CETC in this important multi - center, 7 year trial. This trial will provide enormous insight into the progression of BPH and related symptoms in both an untreated population, i.e. placebo versus one treated with phytotherapeutic agents. This is of particular importance because efficacy can be truly determined only with an understanding of the untreated natural history of BPH. Our primary objective is to ascertain if Serenoa repens or Pygeum africanum delays or prevents the clinical progression of BPH. Patients will be classified as 1) Progression of disease as defined by one of the following: rise in baseline AUA Symptom Score of 4 points; urinary retention; incontinence; or recurrent urinary tract infections; 2) Crossover to known therapy, i.e. medical or invasive prior to clinical progression; 3) non - compliance with the coded medication treatment regimen including patients who elect watchful waiting or open - label phytotherapy. Secondary outcomes include comparative efficacy between Serenoa repens and Pygeum africanum as defined by symptoms and urodynamic measurements.     Through this full scale BPH trial, we hope to ascertain: A) the effects, if any, of phytotherapeutic agents on the clinical progression of BPH, B) the optimal temporal intervention in the treatment of BPH, C) whether specific ethnic groups manifest various forms of BPH resulting in different rates of progression and differential response to therapy? and, D) whether concomitant prostate conditions such as prostatitis are effected by phytotherapeutic intervention for BPH?',\n",

       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are very common findings in aging men and present a considerable health care burden both in terms of morbidity as well as health care resource utilization. Aside from the standard therapy transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), minimally invasive surgical therapies (MIST) have been developed over the past decade, which are utilized to varying degrees. In addition, three classes of medications are currently being utilized for the treatment of LUTS and BPH: alpha adrenergic receptor blocker, 5 alpha reductase inhibitors (5 ARI), and phytotherapeutic agents. The use of alpha blocker is supported by RCTs of up to 12 mo duration and open label extension trials up to 60 mo duration. Use of the 5 ARI is supported by RCTs of up to 48 mo duration and open label extension trials up to 72 mo. duration. Of the many different phytotherapeutic preparations available, few have been studied in randomized placebo-controlled trials usually 6 mo or shorter in duration. The most commonly used preparation is saw palmetto extract, which has undergone the most extensive testing including randomized trials of up to 12 mo duration in direct comparison to an alpha blocker, however, not against placebo. Given the widespread use of these over the counter preparation data regarding the relative safety and efficacy of the most commonly used compounds are urgently needed. The purpose of the consortium is to develop and carry out a relevant clinical trial involving these compounds. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of saw pametto extract and pygeum africanum with a 4 to 6 yrs follow-up period is proposed enrolling approx 3,000 patients at the participating centers with the following objectives: Determine the efficacy.of saw palmetto and pygeum africanum compared with placebo in preventing the progression of LUTS and BPH defined (1) as a twice validated increase in the AUA Symptom Index by four or more points from baseline, (2) as the development of either spontaneous or precipitated acute urinary retention (AUR), (3) as the need for MIST or surgical therapy for BPH with or without a preceding episode of AUR, (4) as the development of renal insufficiency ( due to BPH), recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) (due to BPH), or incontinence. (5) Determine the efficacy of saw palmetto and pygeum africanum compared with placebo in terms of improving the AUA SI, other humanistic questionnaires, sexual functioning, global subjective assessment and maximum urinary flow rate from baseline to end of study. (7) Determine whether baseline parameters are able to predict response to the different therapies administered. (8) Determine whether saw palmetto or pygeum africanum compared to placebo induce measurable changes in prostate volume, transition zone volume, serum PSA and other serum or tissue based biomarkers of BPH.',\n",

The number of men with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH, is expected to increase substantially as the population ages. Interest in using complementary and alternative medicines, such as phytotherapy, to prevent and manage health care needs has increased dramatically in recent years. The use of phytotherapy to relieve lower urinary tract symptoms, particularly BPH, has spurred interest in Serenoa repens (Saw palmetto) and Pygeum africanum. Both phytotherapeutic agents are used extensively in this country to relieve symptoms of BPH, but little is known about their mechanism of action, efficacy, safety, or the side effects. Although a number of randomized placebo-controlled trials have been published, all suffer from a variety of shortcomings. A long-term randomized placebo-controlled trial is needed to determine if Serenoa repens or Pygeum africanum prevents clinical progression of BPH. Secondary objectives should include a direct comparison of the two phytotherapeutic agents in their ability to improve the symptoms of BPH, the relationship between prostate size and clinical progression of BPH or regression of symptoms, and the ability of objective diagnostic studies to determine which patients are optimal candidates for phytotherapy.   The primary goal of this application is to emphasize the ability of Yale University School of Medicine and Yale New Haven Hospital to successfully implement this protocol so that quality data is obtained to achieve the goals of a final protocol yet to be determined.

Health Relatedness: BPH is the most common neoplastic condition afflicting men and constitutes a major factor impacting Americans. Current studies estimate 30% of American males will require a surgical procedure to correct this problem sometime in their life. Increasing attention has been paid to plant extracts (or phytotherapy) use by patients to self-treat medical ailments such as BPH. Until more appropriately conducted trials are undertaken, the efficacy of phytotherapeutic agents will remain unproven. This study will be crucial to answering that question as well as others pertaining to the progression of BPH.      Specific Aims: The primary aim of this study is to address whether SP or PA alter BPH progression or simply delay the time to surgical therapy. The data accumulated should provide evidence regarding long term effects of these therapies on objective parameters of BPH including the AUA symptom score, maximal urinary flow rates, or prostate size and how these medications compare in their impact on the same.      Design and Method: In three treatment arms 1000 patients with symptoms of BPH will be assigned to either SP, PA or placebo and followed for 4-6 years. Progression parameters will include: 1) changes in the AUA symptom score, 2) urinary retention, 3) recurrent UTI, 4) renal insufficiency, 5) urinary incontinence or 6) crossover to known therapy. Objective parameters of BPH will include prostate size, maximal urinary flow rates, and AUA symptom score.

The Lummi Tribal Health Center [LTHC] and Lummi Indian Family Enhancement [LIFE] Program are in the process of completing the development of a comprehensive, multifaceted, program of diabetes prevention, control, and treatment. Resources include a Diabetes Prevention Program and a Fitness Center, the latter built with the tribe\\'s own money. Lana Elliott, Ed.D., an American Indian whose specialty is Curriculum and Instruction, is in the process of revising the Lummi Tribal School\\'s [LTS] entire curriculum, from K-12; completion is expected by June 2003. The Northwest Indian College [NWIC] has an innovative Tribal Environmental and Resource Management 2-year degree, that joins western and traditional Native sciences. The PI is the retired former Director of the IHS Research Program, 1990-2002, and, in 1985-1990, the IHS Portland Area Office Diabetes Control Officer and Director of the Model Diabetes Project. He is now Research Administrator at the NWlC. These resources have joined for this project. Dr. Elliott will add diabetes to her revised curriculum of grades 7-12 of the LTS during Yr-1 of the project. The curriculum will be implemented in Yr-2, and after revision will be replicated in several other tribal schools in Yr-3 and Yr-4. This modified \"Interrupted Time Series with Switching Replication\" will permit a valuable formative evaluation, and rigorous evaluation of impact, of the curriculum.',\n",

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Drug induced liver injury (DILI) is an uncommon adverse drug reaction (ADR) of increasing importance to the medical community, pharmaceutical, regulatory agencies, and the general public. DILI is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and the leading reason for discontinuation of drugs in development as well as removal of approved drugs from the marketplace. The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into DILI. The Retrospective study has collected DNA samples from 58 subjects with liver injury attributed to amoxicillin/clavulanate, valproate, phenytoin, isoniazid for future pharmacogenetic and mechanistic studies. In addition, over 400 patients with DILI due to a multitude of medications and herbal products have been enrolled into the Prospective study wherein DNA, serum, plasma, urine, and liver tissue samples as well as extensive clinical data are collected. To build upon the growing repository of data, biological samples, and research expertise, a competing renewal with expansion of the number of DILIN clinical sites is proposed. The primary aim of this proposal is to continue to enroll bonafide DILI patients with varying disease severity recruited from the Michigan Hepatoxicity Research Network into the DILIN Prospective study at the University of Michigan. A causality assessment instrument as well as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers will be developed from the collected clinical data and biological samples. The secondary aim of this proposal is to conduct pharmacogenetic analyses of DNA samples collected from the DILI cases and controls. Whole genome SNP analyses and/or targeted gene approaches are proposed to help elucidate the contribution of host pharmacogenetics in the susceptibility and outcome of DILI. A Genetic Profiling Committee with bioinformatics expertise is proposed to analyze and interpret the pharmacogenetic data and help formulate additional hypothesis driven mechanistic studies. Finally, maintaining contact with the DILI case patients for up to 20 years after enrollment will allow performance of confirmatory genotype-phenotype association and other follow-up studies in DILI patients, family members, and controls. These supplemental studies may lead to the identification and refinement of genetic biomarkers to assist in the prevention, diagnosis and management of future DILI patients. The third aim of this proposal is to develop an authoritative and comprehensive LiverTox website in conjunction with the National Library of Medicine to help educate and assist practicing physicians, researchers, and the general public on DILI. A LiverTox website will not only improve worldwide knowledge and awareness of DILI but also potentially enhance recruitment for the DILIN Prospective study and other future initiatives.

DILI thus represents a problem of enormous medical, financial, legal and regulatory importance. Although a vast number of drugs, toxins and alternative medications have the potential to cause liver injury, severe DILI is a problem of sufficient rarity that a large group of dedicated investigators working in a cooperative and coordinated effort is required to better understand the pathogenesis of DILI and develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. This proposal brings together a unique, multi-disciplinary consortium of investigators and resources, concentrated within Northern California, with a plan for a continuing participation as a Clinical Center in the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN). Our research plan describes, firstly, the establishment of a large multi-component Clinical Center patient database that would contribute to the DILIN. The proposed DILI patient informational database, serum, DNA and tissue bank will comprise a prospective cohort derived from several sources, each providing distinct epidemiological facets and research potential. These include the Liver Transplant Programs at UCSF, Stanford University and California Pacific Medical Center, the liver clinics and inpatient service at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital, and the HIV Clinic at San Francisco General Hospital. At each site, we have developed strategies to identify well-defined cases of toxin-induced liver injury in a prospective manner that will permit careful collection of detailed epidemiological and clinical information, as well as serum, DNA and tissue samples for biochemical, pharmacological and genetic studies. We plan to initially identify patients with potential DILI based on proposed operational diagnostic criteria and then further evaluate cases using a validated causality assessment instrument. Patients classified as having \"highly probable\" DILI using this instrument will be followed prospectively in order to better define the natural history of DILI. Identification of such DILI-associated polymorphisms is an essential first step in the development of a rational gene-based prevention strategy.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Functional dyspepsia (FD) affects up to one in five people in the United States, can substantially impair quality of life and is very costly; treatment outcomes are variable and often unsatisfactory. Gastric motor and sensory disturbances, and psychiatric co-morbidity, have been identified in FD but it is unknown if these factors influence outcome. There is recent evidence for a genetic component; our pilot data (now published in Gastroenterology) suggest that a heterotrimeric G protein polymorphism may be associated with FD. Antidepressants are commonly prescribed in FD and appear efficacious, but this is not evidence based and the response is variable; there have been no adequate randomized controlled trials with tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) in functional dyspepsia.  We hypothesize in FD that: 1) Amitriptyline (a tricyclic) and escitalopram (an SSRI) will be superior to placebo in terms of global symptom relief at the end of a 12 week trial, adjusting for psychiatric co-morbidity. Moreover, the proportion of global symptom responders will be significantly larger at 6 months after cessation of therapy, compared with the placebo group. 2) Acceleration of solid gastric emptying, reduction of postprandial satiation and enhanced gastric volume change with a meal on antidepressant therapy will be significant positive predictors of beneficial short and long-term outcome in FD. Conversely, negative predictors of outcome will be slowed gastric emptying, increased postprandial satiation and reduced postprandial gastric volume change. 3) The serotonin transporter long homozygous polymorphism will predict a significantly poorer symptom response to escitalopram and amitriptyline compared with the short or heterozygous polymorphisms, while the GNbeta3 CC polymorphism will predict a significantly better symptom response to both classes of antidepressant therapy compared to TT or TC genotype.    We aim in a parallel group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled double dummy, adequately powered three-arm multi-center trial to determine: 1) Whether antidepressant therapy (low dose tricyclic amitriptlyline 50 mg or standard dose escitalopram 10 mg) is more efficacious than placebo in relief of FD. We will also determine if antidepressant therapy reduces disability and improves quality of life in FD, and whether after cessation of therapy, clinical response persists over 6 months. 2) If gastric emptying (motor dysfunction) and the nutrient drink test (a test of gastric hypersensitivity and/or gastric accommodation) is altered by antidepressant therapy, and whether subgroups with altered physiology are associated with treatment outcome. We will directly determine in a sub-study if impaired gastric accommodation (by 99mTc-SPECT) and the symptom response to a nutrient drink test is altered by an antidepressant. 3) If polymorphisms of the serotonin reuptake transporter and the heterotrimeric G protein predict outcome in patients with functional dyspepsia receiving an antidepressant.  Our study will provide the first controlled data on the efficacy of the two major antidepressant drug classes in FD, and the first data on clinical, physiological and genetic factors that may predict a beneficial effect of such therapy in FD.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growth in the use of living kidney donors makes it imperative to study possible adverse, long-term consequences of donation. This prospective cohort study will address whether donation increases the risk of developing end-stage kidney disease (ESRD) and/or increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Pairs of living unrelated or distantly related kidney transplant donors and normal sibling controls will be enrolled. It has been argued that the there is a gradual, long-term, compensatory GFR increase that offsets the normal age-associated decline in GFR, and thereby reduces the risk for ESRD. This proposal will make serial determinations of GFR during the first 3 years after donation to determine when the maximum post-donation GFR occurs. This will set the stage for long-term follow-up studies to determine how much the subsequent age-related declines in GFR increase the risk of ESRD. In addition, a number of observational studies report that patients with mild reductions in GFR are at increased risk for CVD. While CVD risk factors may cause kidney damage, a growing amount of circumstantial evidence suggests that a mild reduction in GFR could adversely affect blood pressure, plasma lipids, glucose homeostasis, homocysteine, and even systemic inflammation. These effects may be most pronounced in the growing number of individuals who develop obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Living kidney donation makes it possible to study the effects of moderate reductions in GFR on CVD risk factors prospectively, using comparable siblings as normal controls. Using unrelated and distantly related donors will allow us to study the effects of donation per se, independent of genetic predisposition from having a close relative with kidney disease. Altogether, this study will provide useful information that will improve the informed consent for living kidney donors and enhance our knowledge of the role of the kidney, if any, in CVD.',\n",

Despite ongoing research, IC remains a controversial entity for two critical reasons. First, the validity of the case definition remains uncertain. There are few data that address a historically important validator--the degree to which IC results from genetic and/or environmental factors. Second, IC is often comorbid with one or more additional physical disorders and yet the causes of comorbidity are uncertain. Taken together, these two sets of unanswered questions contribute significantly to the controversies that continue to surround IC. Moreover, the strong female predominance of IC has been amply documented but is not well understood.  To address these fundamental issues, we propose to conduct a twin study of IC in the population-based Swedish Twin Registry (STR). We propose to assess IC in the cohort of STR twins aged 18-45 years using a web-based screening instrument. Those not participating in the web-based assessment will be offered a computer assisted telephone interview. Based on previous experience, we anticipate that of the 50,011 individuals in this cohort, 75% or 37,500 will respond. These unique data will be used to address the following Specific Aims: (1) To estimate the prevalence of IC and its key co-morbidities in STR participants. To assess the phenotypic patterns of comorbidity of IC with other disorders. (2) To evaluate the genetic and environmental sources of variation for IC through concordances and structural equation modeling. To examine the effects of gender on these effects. (3) To use multivariate twin analyses to investigate the sources of covariation between IC and its frequently co-morbid conditions and (4) To use case-control designs with external controls and internal controls (\"co-twin control\" design) to evaluate the importance of exposures which may infer risk for disease.',\n",

Potential analyses that could be conducted using the C-Kid infrastructure to explore risk-factor disease relationships include traditional prospective cohort analyses where putative risk factors are measured in participants at baseline; nested case-control studies in which laboratory studies are performed on stored baseline specimens in cases (e.g. rapid progressors) and appropriately matched controls (e.g. non-progressors); and cross-cohort analyses utilizing parallel cohorts.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The Frequent Hemodialysis Network (FHN) Study is a randomized clinical trial designed to test hypotheses related to the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of frequent (6x per week) vs. conventional (3x per week) hemodialysis. The recently completed NIDDK-funded MEMO Study demonstrated that survival and many other outcomes were not appreciably influenced by significant increases in equilibrated Kt/Vurea, a parameter of dialysis dose, when hemodialysis was given thrice weekly. Clinical experience and published anecdotal reports suggest that more frequent dialysis may result in reduced frequency and duration of hospitalization, improved control of volume overload, hypertension and anemia, correction of disorders of mineral metabolism, and enhanced quality of life. Given the high mortality rates and significant morbidity associated with end-stage renal disease, a rigorous evaluation of alternative dialysis strategies is warranted. The Investigators have constructed a consortium of University- and community-based nephrologists and dialysis units throughout the state of California - the California Coordinating Clinical Center (CCC). We serve urban and suburban communities with extensive racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity. We intend on enrolling 125 subjects (adults and children) as requested by the RFA. Subject recruitment, retention and adherence have been excellent; plans are in place to augment recruitment at existing sites by approaching additional local dialysis facilities and to expand recruitment to VA medical centers affiliated with participating universities. The sample size will not be sufficient to demonstrate a difference in survival among groups. Safety and clinical events (e.g., hospitalization) will continue to be carefully tracked. With continued enrollment and randomization, the study should have sufficient power to detect clinically meaningful differences in the co-primary outcomes (the composite of mortality and change in left ventricular mass; and the composite of mortality and change in the Physical Health Composite of the SF-36). The study should also have sufficient power to detect clinically meaningful differences in other secondary outcomes. Dr. Chertow and his colleages have assembled a talented group of investigators and coordinators. The consortium has worked effectively with multiple industry partners. We are collectively committed to working cooperatively and constructively with the other CCC and DCC to reach all FHN study goals.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Dialysis mortality is exceedingly high and even higher so in diabetic patients who now account for nearly 50% of incident patients. Attempts to reduce mortality have included higher doses of dialysis, use of more permeable dialyzers, better control of lipids and hypertension, use of pleiotrophic drugs such as ACEs and ARBS, control of oxidative stress and inflammation., improvement in hemoglobin control, choice of accesses, longer dialysis time, salt restriction, exercise, control of calcium and phosphorus metabolism and other approaches. Current 3X week dialysis is limited by the inability to remove small molecules because of reduced efficiency after a few hours and large molecules. Excess fluid cannot be adequately removed because of limited time available and of a relatively narrow range of permeability of dialyzer membranes. A method which is closer operationally to normal renal function is daily dialysis where the efficiency of the dialysis provided more frequently for somewhat shorter times is greater than the 3X week methods. It is expected that increased removal of uremic toxins will result in better outcomes although little evidence exists for any but the association with urea. Just as likely is the potential to control fluid volume so as to approach \"dry weight\" and consequent better control of blood pressure with more frequent treatment times. With twice the opportunity to control target weight and the possibility of reduced interdialytic weight gain, ultrafiltration rates should fall and hypotensive episodes and quality of life improve. The new proposal will take the current daily dialysis study into a phase where all involved will have benefited from knowledge of this important information gathered so far. Enrollment started in January 2006 and the Vanguard phase of the study started June 1, 2006 and was completed on May 31, 2007. Total number of enrolled patients was 79, 17 of whom were withdrawn, 54 randomized and 8 still in baseline. Enrollment continues past the Vanguard phase and as of October 2007 total number of patients enrolled in RRI consortium is 99, 21 were excluded prior to randomization, 64 were successfully randomized, 37 completed 12 month therapy and 27 are still at the different time points of the treatment periods, 14 remain in baseline. The current proposal has permitted the participating sites to benefit from the knowledge gained and to begin offering it widely. The new proposal continues the project utilizing the experience to improve adherence of the daily dialysis patient.     [unreadable]   [unreadable]   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

During the on-going recruitment and follow-up of each FHN trial, the DCC will monitor patient recruitment and compliance as a whole and by clinical center. The database management system previously developed is used to assure accurate and complete collection of trial data. An inquiry system is used to resolve data discrepancies. The DCC will continue to make changes as necessary in the forms, database, manuals of operation, FHN web site, and reports. Many of the interactions with the clinical investigators are done through the work of subcommittees. The DCC will provide yearly centralized training of clinical center staff on the entry of trial patients, the completion of trial forms, and the use of the data management system. The DCC will promote adherence to the trial protocols. Site visit calls or visits to the clinical centers are made as necessary. Trial progress is given in reports to the clinical centers, Steering Committee, and Data Safety and Monitoring Board. Statistical analyses are performed during the course of each trial with final outcome analyses completed and reported at the end of each trial. The DCC handles the planning of meetings and conference calls, and administrative tasks. The DCC will develop new statistical methodology as needed to properly analyze the data being collected. Biological specimens and trial data (at end) are transferred to NIDDK repositories. Since the FHN is a multi-centered effort on two trials, the DCC will provide leadership to coordinate each trial's conduct to optimize resources and gain efficiencies. The DCC will work to foster a spirit of cooperation, which is important in this network. Results from the FHN trials will lead to a better understanding of more frequent hemodialysis beyond the conventional 3x/week and its impact on many outcomes affecting the health and well-being of hemodialysis patients.

While alpha-interferon (IFN) alone or in combination with rabavirin and pegylated interferon (PEG) in combination with RV have been approved by the FDA for use in subjects over 18 years of age, no therapies have been approved for use in pediatric subjects.  Published reports of IFN monotherapy in children with CHC have suggested that response rates are higher than in adults. PEG + RV is the most effective therapy for adults with CHC.  Given that RV is a teratogen, and that subjects < 18 years of age may have high response rates to PEG alone, the purpose of this proposal is to perform a randomized controlled trial to comparing the safety and efficacy of PEG + placebo vs. PEG + RV (1:1 randomization). 112 HCV RNA+ IFN-na[unreadable]ve children 2-16 years of age will be enrolled in this multi-center Phase II clinical trial.  11 pediatric centers will work in collaboration with Roche Laboratories Inc., which will supply the pegylated interferon (Pegasys(tm)), to be given at a dose of 180 mcg/1.73m2 sq week X 48 weeks, with a treatment-free follow-up of 24 weeks. RV will be given at 15 mg/kd/day p.o.b.i.d. (not > 1200 mg/day) in 200 mg tablets. All children randomized to the PEG+RV arm will undergo pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic testing. Children randomized to PEG+ placebo who fail to exhibit viral disappearance (HCV RNA less than 100 copies/ml by Amplicor(tm) polymerase chain reaction assay) at week 12 will be crossed over to PEG and RV (a compassionate monotherapy/combination\" therapy arm). Children who were randomized to PEG and RV who fail to exhibit viral disappearance at week 12 will be maintained on PEG + RV. (a compassionate \"combination/combination\" therapy arm) given the lack of suitable therapeutic alternatives. The primary analysis will be on an intent to treat basis; the primary endpoint will be sustained viral response 24 weeks off therapy. Other endpoints include biochemical and clinical safety assessments. This trial would thus provide critically needed data to guide safe and effective treatment of CHC, a major cause of liver disease in children      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Relative glutamine (GLN) deficiency may contribute to morbidity and mortality in surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients. During critical illness, GLN utilization by the immune system, gut mucosa and other tissues exceeds endogenous production and plasma GLN concentrations decrease, which may contribute to cellular dysfunction and increase nosocomial infection risk and mortality. Conventional GLN-free parenteral nutrition (PN) has a limited impact on SICU outcomes and does not repair the GLN deficit. Our recent pilot data show that GLN dipeptide-supplemented PN decreases nosocomial infections and improves clinical outcomes in SICU patients. The process of benefit is poorly understood, but animal and human data suggest that GLN treatment correlates with a) up-regulation of cytoprotective molecules in blood and tissues [e.g, GSH, specific heat shock proteins (HSPs) and GLN]; and b) improved epithelial barrier defenses and immune cell number and function. Properties of L-GLN limit provision in solution, but the GLN dipeptide alanyl-GLN (AG) confers stability and solubility in PN (AG-PN). We propose a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled phase III trial based on our pilot data to test the hypothesis that AG-PN improves clinical outcomes in SICU patients requiring PN after cardiac, vascular or colonic operations. Subjects will receive either standard GLN-free PN or isocaloric, isonitrogenous, AG-PN until enteral feeds are established. Specific Aim 1 is to determine whether AG-PN decreases hospital mortality, nosocomial infection and other important indices of morbidity. Specific Aim 2 is to obtain novel, mechanistically relevant observational data in the Aim 1 subjects on whether AG-PN a) increases serial blood levels of GSH, HSP-70 and -27, and GLN; b) decreases the presence in serum of the bacterial products flagellin and LPS and the adaptive immune response to these mediators; and c) improves key indices of innate/adaptive immunity. This study is designed to delineate the clinical benefit of a major new nutrition support strategy in high-risk SICU patients',\n",
       " \"Congenital anomalies of the urogenital tract (UGT) represent the third most frequent of all birth defects, occurring in approximately 26-30/10,000 live births. Only heart and limb defects are more prevalent. Such defects can vary from severe (persistent cloaca, cystic kidney disease, hydronephrosis, diphallia) to more moderate (hypospadias, streak gonads, horseshoe kidney, micropenis, crytorchidism, unilateral renal agenesis). Some cancers of the urogenital tract (gonadoblastoma, Wilms' tumour) represent a persistence of the embryonic state. In addition, adult onset renal disease and other disorders of the UGT show reactivation of molecules key to the normal development of the UGT. Indeed, there is now evidence that the number of nephrons endowed before birth in your kidneys can affect whether or not you will present with chronic renal disease later in life. All these observations highlight the need to comprehensively understand the molecular basis of UGT development. The starting point for this understanding is the temporal and spatial analysis of  all genes expressed during UGT development. Genomic tools such as library construction and microarray-  based expression profiling produce datasets that are not readily interpretable in terms of function without a  cellular context. Hence, expression data needs to be communally collected as in situ data and amassed in a visual atlas. As part of our current funding from the NIDDK, we have generated (and will continue to do so)  expression profilng data from across time and space in the developing kidney and ureter. Hence we have defined a set of approximately 2500 genes tht we know are involved in UGT development. Our current focus  is only on secreted and transmembrane encoding genes. We propose to comprehensively analyse the expression of these genes in the developing UGT using wholemount in situ hybridisation (ISH) of E9 whole  embryo, E10.5-13.5 UGT and section ISH of E15.5, 17,5 and adult kidney, testis, ovary, ureter and bladder.  Section ISH will be performed using a Tecan Freedom EVO 150 Genepaint system. Immunohistochemistry for known renal subcompartment markers will be performed after ISH to clarify the localisation of the  expression. The genes which we will analyse will come from our own microarray-based expression profiling  of kidney development over time and within subcompartments (dynamic and spatially-restricted), or meta-  analysis of other datasets, including the RIKEN data on kidney expression and microarray-based expression  3rofiling of normal kidney or renal disease.\",\n",

Despite the vital importance of the kidney to maintaining the normal physiological equilibrium of an individual, there is a relatively poor understanding of the developmental program that creates the functional organ. Our goal is to generate a detailed spatial map of the cellular expression of selected regulatory genes during mammalian (mouse) kidney development to generate a \"molecular anatomy\" of the developing kidney. We will also create a series of transgenic mouse strains that will allow the ready identification and genetic manipulation of key cell types. Aim 1: We will perform a genome-wide analysis of the expression of all genes encoding mouse transcriptional regulators, ligands and cognate surface receptors in the embryonic urogenital system. Aim 2: We will generate a high resolution section in situ hybridization (SISH) map of the expression of all genes in Aim 1 in the fetal and neonatal kidney. Aim 3: We will perform transcriptional array analysis of renal tubule deficient mouse kidneys and micro-dissected kidney tubules to identify, and subsequently map the expression of tubule specific genes. Aim 4: We will use BAC-mediated transgenics to express fluorescent reporter proteins and Cre recombinase in specific cell populations for cell marking, cell fate and genetic manipulation studies.

The work will be done in close collaboration with laboratories producing this data and will: 1. Build a database to collate and disseminate all types of gene expression data generated by the MAGUD Consortium. The MAGUD gene expression database will be continuously updated, curated, and fully integrated with the MAGUD atlas. 2. Build a morphological atlas that will provide a reference description of GU development in the mouse. The MAGUD Atlas will function as an integrative spatial, temporal and conceptual framework for all data relating to GU development and disease. The web-accessible atlas will comprise a time-series (E9 to adult) of low and high-resolution 3D digital models of genitourinary development integrated with a textual anatomical ontology, a catalogue of cell types and a quantitative morphological description of mouse kidney, ureter and bladder development, which will provide a baseline for future studies that examine the effects of experimental manipulations. The MAGUD Atlas will be linked to the gene expression database, cell catalogue and other relevant resources such that these data can be associated with the appropriate location in the 3D structure of the GU system and time during development. Analytical tools, centered on the Atlas, will integrate data at all levels of scale and thus create a bioinformatics environment for the generation of hypothesis about gene function, molecular pathways, cell differentiation and behavior, tissue morphogenesis and growth. This work will thus provide an integrated molecular and morphological description of GU development as a platform for modeling the processes of development, disease, and therapy.

Once the nepheron is formed, the next stage of development is for the loop of Henle and collecting duct to elongate into the renal pelvis, forming the medulla. Delineation of the spatial and temporal expression patterns of genes in kidney is essential for understanding its organogenesis and physiological function. Therefore, we proposed to analyze the expression patterns of 100 genes in the developing kidney. These genes are either novel or have not been reported to be expressed or to be functioning in the kidney. We will tag these genes with GFP to visualize the spatio-temporal expression patterns. Analyses of these mice will be enable us to: 1) determine the effect of the loss of the gene function on renal development; 2) follow the fate of the homozygous mutant cells as they are now marked by GFP; and 3) determine the subcellular localization of the gene product by visualizing the GFP tag, which often time is very revealing about a gene's function      [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",

The fetal testis plays an essential role in normal male urogenital tract development and many male urogenital tract disorders are linked to fetal testis perturbations. To understand the impact of genetic and environmental influences on testicular development, it is essential to determine normal gene expression patterns in the fetal testis during development. The goals of this proposal are to 1) define the 3-dimensional (3-D) spatial gene dynamics in relationship to structural development and hormonal balance in the developing testis and 2) identify cell-specific genes that can be used as biomarkers for key differentiation events. The following specific aims will address these goals: 1) Map global gene expression within specific regions in the developing fetal testis at critical developmental stages using laser capture microdissection and microarray analysis; 2) Quantitatively map key gene expression changes to specific regions within the developing fetal testis using laser capture microdissection and high throughput quantitative RT-PCR; 3) Identify testicular biomarkers representing cell-specific differentiation genes using in situ hybridization; 4) Develop a computer-based, 3-D model of the fetal testis incorporating the spatial and temporal expression patterns of key genes. Laser capture microdissection of select regions within the fetal testis during late gestation (gestation days 14-18) will be combined with microarray analysis and high-throughput real-time RT-PCR to characterize global gene expression. In situ hybridization will be used to identify gene expression in specific cell types. These data will be combined with a computerized structural mesh of the fetal testis to create a 3-D spatial and temporal gene expression model. This information will provide researchers with valuable tools for further investigations into normal fetal testicular development as well as the causes, treatment, and prevention of male urogenital tract disorders      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Because research has been hampered by the lack of a clear and well accepted case definition, little is known about the prevalence of 1C in the population, the full burden of disease for IC patients, the kinds of care they seek, and the kinds of treatment they receive. At present, there is no standardized questionnaire for patient screening or epidemiological studies. The lack of information about IC makes it difficult to meet patients' needs for medical and non-medical care. In the proposed research, therefore, we will establish (1) a case definition of IC in women for patient screening or epidemiological studies using a Delphi panel of experts in IC and diseases with similar symptoms; (2) develop and validate a symptom questionnaire that can be used to identify female IC patients and distinguish them from those with similar conditions (e.g., overactive bladder, urinary tract infection, and endometriosis); (3) develop an IC-specific measure of self-reported functional status, including physical, mental, social, sexual/relationship, role functioning and other factors identified by IC patients as important; (4) survey more than 300,000 women for urinary symptoms and, using the validated symptom questionnaire, screen more than 23,000 to estimate prevalence of IC in the United States and provide a sample of 354 women over age 18 who fit the case definition for IC and 300 who have IC-like symptoms; (5) describe the impact of IC on patient's lives, including IC-specific functional status and the impact of IC on quality of life, mental and physical health, stress and coping, social support, sexual functioning, social functioning, labor force participation and income, as well as utilization of traditional and alternative care and compare these results with existing data on disease burden for other chronic diseases.\",\n",

The central thesis is that a combination of laser capture microdissection and microarrays can be used to efficiently achieve this goal. Microarrays with essentially complete gene representation can be used to rapidly determine the expression levels of every gene in laser capture microdissected elements of the developing kidney.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) established that the microvascular complications of diabetes can be prevented by maintaining near normal glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). This seminal outcome has provided a strong impetus for developing effective tolerogenic strategies for a cell replacement via pancreas or isolated islet transplantation in T1D patients. The recent success of the \"Edmonton protocol\" was a major advance in the field of islet transplantation. However, despite initial achievement of an insulin independent state, a progressive loss of beta cell function culminates in the recurrence of diabetes in a majority of these recipients. Thus, the Edmonton approach, which targets the T lymphocyte compartment alone, seems insufficient in preventing immunological rejection and recurrent anti-beta cell autoimmunity. Despite the critical role of T lymphocytes in these two processes, it is established that a concomitant and specific B lymphocyte response against beta-cell derived allo- and auto-antigenic epitopes also occurs. In rodent studies we demonstrated that interruption of B lymphocyte function curtails the T cell mediated destruction of islet allografts. Thus, we hypothesize that an induction immunotherapy regimen which targets both the B- and T lymphocyte compartments, will promote immunological tolerance to islet allografts. Our preclinical studies test this premise in non-human primates (NHPs) and indicate that the combined use of anti-B and T-lymphocyte antibodies (i.e., Rituximab and Thymoglobulin) results in long-term islet allograft survival without the need for maintenance therapy with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) agent. In the present application we propose to determine the efficacy of combined B- and T- lymphocyte directed immunotherapy for promoting immunological tolerance to islet allografts in T1D patients. We will initiate a clinical trial which will: 1) build upon our experience with the \"Edmonton protocol\", by incorporating the B lymphocyte specific monoclonal antibody, Rituximab, into its induction regimen and 2) assess the efficacy of a combined induction regimen including Thymoglobulin and Rituximab followed by CNI-free maintenance monotherapy with Rapamycin. Importantly, the latter protocol, which parallels that used in our preclinical NHP studies, will permit the inclusion of T1D patients with microalbuminuria into islet transplantation trials. A series of prospective in vivo metabolic studies will be undertaken to specifically evaluate beta cell function and secretory capacity following transplantation that 1) includes Rituximab and 2) eliminates CNI agents. Our mechanistic studies are designed to test the hypothesis that Rituximab immunotherapy provides a \"tolerogenic window\" for the reconstituting B lymphocyte repertoire, during which allo- and auto-reactive clones with a transitional phenotype are subject to negative selection. Following islet cell transplantation we will: 1) monitor the development of alloantibodies to HLA antigens and autoantibodies to islet antigens, 2) analyze the immunoglobulin repertoire for clonal persistence and heterogeneity using antibody CDR3 spectratyping, 3) survey the cytokine profiles of autoantigen-specfic T cells reactive to islet beta-cells by ELISpot, and 4) perform immunophenotyping and functional assays of circulating lymphocytes to assess global alterations in lymphocyte differentiation and energy. Overall, the proposed studies will determine whether a balanced immunotherapy regimen targeting the B- and T- lymphocyte compartments promotes a state of immunological tolerance to islet allografts, while obviating the need for chronic immunosuppression.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Limited availability of insulin producing tissue, requires optimization of outcomes in islet processing and pretransplant culture, while minimizing islet loss in the early post-transplant period, as well as long-term.  The Clinical Component of this proposal will focus on treating islets pre-transplant, and recipients (during and post-transplant), with selected agents with a unique spectrum of anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and beta cell enhancing properties (Lisofylline and Exenatide), to improve beta cell function and viability, maximizing pre-transplant functional islet mass, islet engraftment and long-term function, in patients with Type 1 diabetes. The two treatment variables, Lisofylline and Exenatide (and their effect on engraftment and beta cell function) will be tested in a factorial design with a balanced randomization scheme into the four treatment groups. The randomization will be performed centrally and will be stratified by center. All Islets will be processed at the University of Miami, and recipients (N=96) will be recruited and transplanted at 3 sites (UM, Baylor-Houston and UVA).  The Mechanistic Component of this proposal will enable us to identify those preparations that have optimal beta cell content, viability and potency. Determination of beta cell viability, analysis of mitochondrial potential and apoptotic status and dynamic measures of GSIS will allow to establish not only islet integrity prior to transplantation, but also comparability of the islet preparation used in the selected treatment groups. Measures of nonspecific inflammation in the early post transplant period will determine the most effective treatment strategy to maximize engraftment. Studies of recipient immune status, including measures of auto and allo reactivity, as well as the ability of cells to respond to nonspecific stimuli in the setting of global immune suppression, will assess whether or not immune mediated islet loss is decreased in recipients of Lisofylline and/or Exenatide, and to identify indicators of long-term islet graft acceptance.',\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urolithiasis is a disease that effects 12% of the population and its incidence is growing. In the US there are over 1.1 million visits annually to Emergency Departments for renal colic. The disease is extremely painful, often requiring large amounts of narcotic analgesia, and results in lost work days. Moreover, up to 30% of patients may eventually require lithotripsy or surgical removal of the stone. Currently there are no medical interventions other than analgesia which are offered to patients. Based on encouraging results from several small European clinical studies, we hypothesize that the administration of tamsulosin and/or a steroid to patients with symptomatic urolithiasis will enhance stone passage, and reduce both the time to recovery and the need for surgical intervention or lithotripsy. We will conduct a study by identifying and recruiting patients presenting with urolithiasis in the emergency departments of four institutions. A total of 302 consenting subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) tamsulosin for a maximum of 28 days and an oral steroid for a maximum of 10 days, 2) tamsulosin and placebo, 3) steroid and placebo, and 4) double placebo. In addition, both groups will receive standard analgesic therapy. The study team, which will be blinded to treatment status, will monitor each subject's clinical progress and outcome.The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to determine which protocol is the most effective, and 2) to evaluate the safety of the therapy. The secondary objective is to identify the most appropriate clinical subgroup(s) for treatment. If the therapeutic benefits observed in smaller clinical studies are replicated, administration of these medications should produce several benefits, including: a) a reduction in time to pain free recovery and hence a more rapid return to employment; b) decreased requirements for narcotic analgesia; c) less need for urological out-patient clinic follow-up; d) decreased need for surgical intervention or lithotripsy and e) substantial cost savings. If this therapy is beneficial, it will represent a major advance in the treatment of urolithiasis. This objective is a major stated goal of the NIDDK Clinical Urology Program, which has a stated mission to improve the treatment of urolithiasis. Kidney stones are a major public health issue, and one person in eight will be affected by the disease. If our hypothesis is verified, we will provide the first medical therapy ever for this disease. This therapy, if effective, will reduce the amount of time a patient is off work because of the pain from the disease, and may also reduce the need for expensive and time-consuming surgical treatments.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to assess the fall in glomerular filtration rate attributable to the commonly utilized therapy of parenteral iron in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesize that in subjects with mild to moderate CKD, infusion of intravenous iron (MR) when compared to oral iron, will generate oxidative stress and cause an inflammatory response that will be associated with a more rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared to oral iron. Comparison of IV iron with oral iron will allow testing the hypothesis that MR is injurious to the kidney. Specific aims: We will directly test the hypothesis that MR will generate an inflammatory response and albuminuria in the short-term, that will directly lead to a greater rate of fall in GFR, in the long-term, compared to oral iron. We hypothesize that after administration of one gram of IV iron over a course of 8 weeks, renal injury as documented by albuminuria (and fall in GFR) will be increased with IV iron sucorse therapy compared to those randomized to oral iron therapy. Methods: A randomized, parallel group, controlled trial will be performed. GFR will be measured every 6 months for two years in 200 participants by iothalamate clearances. Significance: Intravenous iron is commonly utilized and is likely a mechanism of renal injury in patients with CKD. Novelty and Health Relatedness of the Project: This proposal will provide translational data on the role of intravenous iron to progression of kidney disease in patients with CKD.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Only a fraction of persons with Type 1 diabetes, less than 40%, go on to develop nephropathy. In those individuals susceptible to nephropathy, the natural history is characterized by a fairly predictable pattern of events. When urinary albumin excretion is within the normal range, the prevalence of hypertension based on office blood pressure readings is similar to that in the general population. Many of these patients, however, develop nocturnal hypertension before the development of microalbuminuria. Yet, early pharmacological intervention with ACE inhibitors is currently recommended only after there is an indication of kidney damage, as reflected by the presence of microalbuminuria. Prior to microalbuminuria initiation of ACE therapy is currently not recommended because it would result in over-treatment of a majority of subjects who will never develop microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy. By the time that microalbuminuria develops, however, the renal lesions of diabetes are often present and many patients progress to overt clinical nephropathy. It would therefore be greatly beneficial if one could identify those patients susceptible to develop microalbuminuria, so that therapy could be instituted early for those individuals at high risk. The proposed study is aimed at demonstrating that it is possible to prevent the progression to microalbuminuria by the preemptive administration of an ACE inhibitor to \"normotensive\", normoalbuminuric subjects with type 1 diabetes targeted on the basis of nocturnal hypertension, i.e. those in whom the physiologic fall in sleep blood pressure is blunted (\"non-dippers\"). This approach would be of great preventative value at a very early stage in the course of diabetes, i.e. prior to the development of either microalbuminuria or hypertension. Thus, we propose a novel trial of primary prevention of microalbuminuria in \"normotensive\" type 1 diabetes targeted on the basis of nocturnal hypertension. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to demonstrate that in subjects with nocturnal hypertension (\"non- dippers\"), the administration of the ACE inhibitor, ramipril, will decrease the rate of development microalbuminuria. 2) To demonstrate that progression to microalbuminuria in subjects with nocturnal hypertension, \"non-dippers\", treated with placebo is higher than in \"dippers\" also treated with placebo. In addition, these studies will provide novel information as to whether endothelial dysfunction, assessed by brachial artery flow mediated vasodilation antedates microalbuminuria in subjects with Type 1 diabetes, particularly in those with nocturnal hypertension. Moreover, these studies will reveal the impact of long-term ACE inhibition on nocturnal hypertension and endothelial dysfunction in normotensive type 1 diabetics.

We have already redefined ALF in children, demonstrated that the etiologies of ALF in children differs greatly from those seen in adults, described unique features of autoimmune hepatitis associated ALF, and are now conducting a clinical trial using intravenous (IV) N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to treat non- acetaminophen ALF. The Specific Aims of this application are: (1) To collect, maintain, analyze and report clinical, epidemiological, and outcome data in children with ALF, including information derived from serum, tissue, and DNA specimens. Long-term outcome data on patients not enrolled in other NIH-funded pediatric consortia will be collected through the PALFSG. To conserve resources, the NIDDK repositories for tissue, DNA and serum will be utilized. These data will be used to develop predictors of prognosis, analyze trends, and provide materials to investigators. (2) To identify unrecognized mechanisms of hepatocellular injury resulting in ALF in children. Studies will assess the impact of fatty acid oxidation defects, NK cell dysfunction, and acetaminophen on the pathogenesis of ALF. Through these studies, novel treatment strategies may be developed.

First, stem cells will be have to be isolated and expanded. Second, the stem cells will have to undergo directed and controlled differentiation toward the beta-cell lineage. Finally, fully functional beta-cells must be isolated from the resulting complex mixes of cells. In this application, we propose to develop reagents that will assist in the further development of all three of these steps. We will generate a comprehensive panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against cell surface epitopes of murine, primate and human pancreatic cells. These antibodies will permit the fractionation of pancreatic cell suspensions using fluorescence activated cell sorting and/or magnetic bead panning. This approach can be used to isolate pancreatic stem cells (step 1) as well as for the purification of differentiated progeny before therapeutic transplantation (step 3). In addition, this proposal is designed to identify the network of genes controlled by the pancreatic transcription factor, PDX-1. Evidence suggests that the family of protein-coding genes under the control of PDX-1 defines many of the phenotypic characteristics of differentiated beta cells. Although a few of these genes have been identified, the full constellation of PDX-1 responsive targets is unknown. We propose that PDX-1 also drives the expression of non-coding genes that are equally important for regulating beta cell function (steps 2&3). Definition of both families of targets is required for a complete understanding of beta cell biology and pathophysiology      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

As more teenagers develop extreme obesity and seek bariatric surgery, our long term goal is to elucidate the health benefits and risks of surgical weight loss for adolescents. Our central hypothesis is that severe obesity in adolescence is associated with medical and psychosocial impairments which may be more effectively treated with surgery during adolescence rather than later in adulthood. This is based on our observations that adolescents presenting for bariatric surgery 1) have overt and occult medical comorbidities and have already developed psychosocial problems which are likely to worsen, 2) lose significant weight following bariatric surgery, and 3) experience improvement in a number of serious obesity-related conditions such as features of the metabolic syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and quality of life. However, compliance by adolescents with prescribed medical regimens can be poor and may adversely affect beneficial outcomes of bariatric surgery performed in adolescence. Thus, the purpose of this proposal is to elucidate for the first time benefits and define complications to be expected when bariatric surgery is performed in adolescence compared to the alternative, bariatric surgery in adulthood. Our Specific Aims are: To determine whether key health indicators significantly differ between adolescents and adults seeking bariatric surgery and determine whether there is an age-related health benefit in performing bariatric surgery earlier rather than later in the lifetime; 2) To identify health risks for adolescents and adults undergoing bariatric surgery; 3) To document the psychosocial status of adolescents and adults with extreme obesity before and after bariatric surgery. Adolescents will be recruited from several high volume adolescent bariatric centers and a comparison cohort from adult bariatric centers participating in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS). By comparison of features of the metabolic syndrome, sleep apnea indices, complications, nutritional status, regimen adherence, and psychosocial status, we will begin to understand medical and psychological health outcomes of bariatric surgery using obesity duration as a moderating variable. This comparison will lead to a better understanding of the plasticity of important medical and psychosocial obesity-related comorbidities in the life-course of those with severe obesity. By also defining risks in the adolescent population, these data will be invaluable for scientifically informing decision-making regarding appropriate timing of surgery for young Americans whose health is increasingly threatened by extreme obesity.

I propose to bring two technologies to the BCBC; one will identify new and unanticipated transcription factor-based regulatory events that are relevant to endocrine development, and the other will define endothelial cell signaling factors that promote endocrine differentiation and pancreatic stromal cell survival. In our first Aim, we will generate in vivo footprinting data and related information on proendocrine transcription factor genes at different stages of pancreatic development and aging, to better define regulatory events that govern endocrine progenitor cell differentiation and beta cell regenerative capacity. By disseminating data to members of the BCBC, collaborators can help us define new factor-regulatory sequence interactions and use the information to monitor, predict, and ultimately perturb beta cell generation from stem cells and during islet regeneration. This approach is complementary to existing genetic studies, which give terminal phenotypes but not information about genetic regulatory mechanisms. In our second Aim, we will use existing endothelial cell lines and create new ones from mouse embryos to identify endothelial signaling factors that promote endocrine progenitor differentiation and pancreatic stromal cell survival. Since endothelial cells and stromal cells both control pancreatic growth, these studies are intended to reveal new signaling molecules that control islet development and regeneration. We also plan to link Aims 1 and 2 by investigating transcription factor occupancies at pro-endocrine genes in response to endothelial signals. By sharing technology and information from our work with the BCBC, our basic developmental studies will be more rapidly translated to develop cures for diabetes      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Type I diabetes is characterized by the permanent loss of pancreatic insulin-producing beta cells. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms determining pancreatic beta cell mass, as a first step toward the development of regenerative therapies for diabetes. In collaboration with the BCBC Coordinating Center and members of the consortium, we will use transgenic mouse technology to examine the hypothesis that beta cells have a significant regenerative capacity, which is modulated by specific signals. The specific aims are to:  [unreadable] 1. Develop a system for regulated ablation of pancreatic beta cells. Our preliminary studies indicate that mice can recover from a pulse of beta cell ablation. We will characterize in detail the physiological and histological aspects of ablation and recovery, in order to understand the mechanisims of beta cell regeneration.  [unreadable] 2. Determine the cellular origins of regenerating beta cells. We will employ genetic lineage tracing to definitely determine the contributions of stem cells and pre-existing beta cells to beta cell regeneration.  [unreadable] 3. Characterize the signals that regulate beta cell mass. The relative importance of blood-borne signals will be determined, with emphasis on the role of insulin and glucose metabolism. In addition, we will assess the significance of beta cell dedifferentiation in vivo and in vitro.  [unreadable] Insights from these studies will be applied to primary beta cell cultures, with the aim of improving yield, preventing dedifferentiation and minimizing cell death      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] The ability to generate multiple cell types from embryonic stem (ES) cell in culture offers unprecedented opportunities to investigate the mechanisms that regulate the earliest stages of lineage commitment that lead to the development of the primary germ layers; ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. In addition, ES cells offer a novel and potentially unlimited supply of cells for transplantation for the treatment of a broad range of diseases. For the basic biological and therapeutic potential of the ES cell system to be fully realized, it is essential to first define the mechanisms that regulate lineage induction and tissue specification in this model. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the mechanisms that regulate endoderm induction and pancreatic specification in both mouse and human ES cell differentiation cultures. The overall approach is to focus the experiments in each of the first three aims on three specific stages of development. In the first aim, we will use a mouse ES cell line with the GFP cDNA targeted to the brachyury locus and human CD4 targeted to the Foxa2 (HNF3() locus to define the signaling pathways required for the earliest stage of development, the establishment of a primitive streak-like population. Induction of a population comparable to the primitive streak represents the first step in the development of definitive endoderm. The focus of the second aim is to determine what factors regulate the development of endoderm and Pdx1+ pancreatic progenitors from the primitive streak-like cells. The third aim will define the conditions necessary for the maturation of Pdx1+ progenitors to functional insulin secreting cells. In the fourth aim, we will translate the findings from the studies with mouse ES cells to the human system. Approaches comparable to those used for differentiation of the mouse ES cells will be used to establish conditions necessary for the development of primitive streak-like cells, endoderm, pancreatic progenitors and insulin-secreting cells from human ES cells. For these experiments we will use the following human ES cell lines: ES02, ES03, ES04, TE-03, TE-06, MI01, UC01, WA01, WA07, WA09, BG02 and BG03. The outcome of these experiments will provide new insights into the regulation of endoderm induction and pancreatic specification in the ES cell differentiation model      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] We propose the generation of a transgenic model of rapid inducible diabetes. The major aim of this proposal is to determine the origin of insulin-producing beta-cells in adult mice. In these animals, complete, or partial, selective destruction of pancreatic beta-cells will be induced, either during development, during postnatal growth or in adults, upon administration of an inducer drug. These animals will not be engineered to study the pathogenesis of Type I diabetes and the autoimmune mechanisms, nor inflammation; rather, they will be useful to accurately assess islet (beta-cell) neoformation in adult pancreas during the regeneration process that should follow the treatment with the inducer agent. They will also be used in reconstitution assays to determine the differentiation potential of injected stem / progenitor cells, whether i.v. or directly into the pancreas, derived either from pancreatic or extra-pancreatic tissues (e. g. hepatic, neural or hematopoietic stem cells, or ES cell clones). Incidentally, this transgenic model will represent a unique tool to study the involvement of beta-cells in pancreas homeostasis, besides their role of producing insulin. The specific aims are: i) generation of a transgenic model of beta-cell ablation, which will be useful to ii) study beta-cell regeneration and to iii) perform in vivo clonogenic reconstitution assays of transplanted cells. Beyond the basic processes of organ growth and maintenance, this study may have implications for cell replacement therapy in diabetes and for all ethical issues related to the use of embryonic or adult stem cells. Once generated, these transgenic strains will be put into the \"public\" Beta Cell Biology Consortium (BCBC) mouse repository, so as to become available to the broad scientific community, as we have already done with other transgenic mice that we produced in the past      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) afflicts 14 million patients; many patients have undiagnosed gastroparesis (GP) and suffer from nausea, bloating, and abdominal discomfort. Broad objectives of this study are to: 1) determine the prevalence and heritable components of gastric motility abnormalities (e.g. GP, gastric dysrhythmias) and dyspepsia-like symptoms in sibling pairs with T2DM; 2) investigate mechanisms of dyspepsia symptoms and gastric motility dysfunction during acute provocative test meals; and 3) determine the effect of treatment of hyperglycemia on dyspepsia symptoms and gastric motility disorders. Specific aims are: 1) to determine the prevalence of dyspepsia symptoms, GP, and gastric dysrhythmias in a large, well- characterized, community-based population of sibling pairs with T2DM currently enrolled in an NIH sponsored study; 2) to correlate demographics, symptoms, laboratory results, gastric motility test data, and hereditable components in sibling pairs with T2DM with and without GP; 3) to investigate mechanisms of GP and dyspepsia symptoms by measuring gastric myoelectrical activity and selected hormones (e.g., ghrelin, cholecystokinin, and vasopressin) in response to provocative test meals; and 4) to determine the effect of aggressive glucose control on dyspepsia symptoms and gastric motility function. Research design incorporates the recruitment of 200 sibling pairs from a data base of 1200 well-characterized T2DM patients. Symptom questionnaires, solid-phase gastric emptying studies and electrogastrogram recordings with provocative test meal will be completed over the 5 year period (Long-Term Study). Results from these studies will determine the prevalence of gastropathies and dyspepsia symptoms in a comprehensive study of a large population with T2DM. A subset of T2DM patients with and without GP will undergo non-invasive physiologic testing and hormone assays during a provocative water load test and a caloric meal test. Results of these studies will provide new insights into postprandial symptoms in patients with T2DM with and without GP. In the Short-Term Study, patients with GP and HbA1c >8 will be treated aggressively to obtain normal glucose levels and HbA1c levels during a 6 month time period and compared with T2DM patients with normal gastric emptying and HbA1C <8. Electrogastrogram testing with non-caloric and caloric meal tests will be repeated after 3 and 6 months and solid-phase gastric emptying tests after 6 months of therapy. Results from the Short-Term Study will indicate the relevance of hyperglycemia on symptoms, gastric dysrhythmias, and GP in patients with T2DM. There is an epidemic of T2DM in the United States and many patients have unrecognized stomach motility disorders. The proposed research will determine prevalence of the \"diabetic stomach\" in patients with T2DM, investigate mechanisms of dyspepsia symptoms and stomach neuromuscular dysfunction, and evaluate the role of hyperglycemia in stomach motility dysfunction      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Patients with gastroparesis often suffer with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms that are not adequately treated due, in part, to a lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and due, in part, to a lack of effective treatments. The participation of Temple University Gastrointestinal Motility Center in the NIH/NIDDK Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium and the proposed studies will help achieve the broad, long term objectives of improving the diagnosis and treatment of patients with gastroparesis. Temple is exceptionally well qualified to be one of the clinical centers in this consortium. Temple has clinical expertise and an active research program in the evaluation and treatment of patients with gastroparesis.  [unreadable] Our short-term study proposal is designed to test the hypotheses that botulinum toxin injection into the pylorus improves dyspeptic symptoms and accelerates gastric emptying in a subgroup of patients who can be identified with physiologic testing. We propose a prospective, multi-center, randomized, placebo- controlled, double blind study to assess the efficacy of botulinum toxin on symptoms and gastric emptying. We will analyze factors that may be predictive of a beneficial response including type and severity of gastroparesis, baseline pyloric pressure, gender, and specific symptom profiles.  [unreadable] Our long-term study proposal is a longitudinal cohort study of patients with gastroparesis designed to understand the causes and improve the treatment of symptom exacerbations in patients with gastroparesis. In this study, patients' symptoms will be followed on a regular basis using an Internet-based telemedicine system. This will allow several antecedent factors to be followed that may be responsible for symptom exacerbation including glucose control, dietary intake, psychological stress, and inflammation. Additionally, the symptomatic response of patients to two agents (domperidone and desipramine) that may be effective in improving symptoms but target different pathophysiologic processes will be assessed. Domperidone is a prokinetic/antiemetic agent, whereas desipramine is a symptom modulator/antidepressant agent.  [unreadable] The proposed protocols will help define patient populations that may respond to different types of treatments for gastroparesis. The protocols use novel diagnostic tests to better define the pathophysiology of gastroparesis. These studies will also better define the disease course of patients with gastroparesis      [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Gastroparesis is a potentially devastating chronic medical illness disproportionately affecting young women. Its pathogenesis remains unknown and there are few effective therapies available. Meaningful research in this area has been hampered by the fact that no single center sees enough patients across the spectrum of clinical presentation; gastric tissue from patients with gastroparesis is not readily available; and sophisticated methodology to perform pathological and molecular analysis of the enteric nervous system and related tissues is not generally available. The overall aim of this proposal is to lay the foundation for creating a network of clinical research sites with central data collection and analysis, and develop and implement common research protocols to study gastroparesis. In this respect, there are three specific aims: 1. To participate in the design and to support the development of a Gastroparesis Database (GPD) that will serve as an instrument to support the other specific aims of this proposal as well as facilitate clinical and translational research across the Consortium. We propose a variety of epidemiological, clinical, physiological and outcome inputs should go into this database, with the long-term goal of phenotyping patients i.e. classifying them into pathophysiologically defined subsets. Such a classification would then facilitate the search for etiopathogenesis, enhance the ability to do large clinical trials and ultimately lead to the development of more rational and effective therapeutic approaches. 2. To understand the pathological basis of gastroparesis and identify molecular factors involved in its pathogenesis. This is the first of two clinical studies proposed and will be primarily carried out at UTMB and the Mayo Clinic, Rochester. Under this aim we propose a systematic approach to studying the pathological changes in the stomach of these patients, characterize the changes in key molecules and signaling pathways and correlate them with the clinical presentation. We will collect full-thickness gastric tissue in a prospective manner from a large number of patients with gastroparesis and analyze them by state-of-the-art methodology for morphological and molecular changes including genome wide expression analysis and proteomics. 3. To study the efficacy of a novel drug strategy targeted against the NK1 receptor in the treatment of gastroparesis. This is the second clinical study proposed and based on the hypothesis that the SP-NK1 receptor signaling plays a major role in nausea and pain, two of the most important symptoms of gastroparesis. Under this aim we will assess the effects of the newly approved NK1 receptor, aprepitant, on symptoms in patients with gastroparesis and assess its effects on measures of gastric function. These studies will provide insight into the underlying mechanism of gastroparesis and eventually lead to new and more effective forms of therapy      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Diabetic gastropathy, presenting as nausea, vomiting, bloating, and pain, has been considered synonymous with gastroparesis as many patients exhibit delayed gastric emptying. Yet, emptying rates correlate poorly with symptoms and improvements on therapy do not associate with normalized emptying. Thus, other factors are pathogenic of gastropathic symptoms in diabetes. Dysfunctional visceral afferent transmission purportedly underlies symptoms in functional bowel disorders. Recent studies have shown that hyperalgesia is present in some diabetics with nausea and bloating. We hypothesize: (1) altered gastric sensation is prevalent in diabetic gastropathy and correlates with symptoms, (2) sensory abnormalities relate to other diabetic neuropathies, (3) altered sensation parallels the natural history of gastropathy, and (4) responses to therapy relate to improved afferent function. We propose 2 multicenter protocols to be conducted by the Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium. Diabetics with >6 months of nausea, vomiting, bloating, early satiety, or discomfort will be recruited. The first protocol will relate gastric sensory and accommodation defects, measured by satiety and barostat tests, to specific gastropathy symptoms, diabetic complications, psychosocial parameters, quality of life measures, gastric emptying, and measures of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. These studies will quantify the prevalence of afferent dysfunction in diabetic gastropathy and assess its potential pathogenic role in symptom development in this condition. The second protocol will follow diabetics with gastropathy longitudinally. Serial satiety, barostat, and gastric, emptying tests will be correlated with clinical parameters and measures of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy to compare when abnormal gastric sensory vs. motor function develop in the natural history of diabetes. Subsets of patients in this longitudinal study will enroll in treatment trials. Satiety, accommodation, perception, and emptying will be quantified before and at 12 weeks of double-blind therapy with the pure prokinetic drug erythromycin vs. placebo. In separate individuals, gastric testing will be performed before and 24 weeks after implantation of the gastric stimulator (Enterra)-which has little prokinetic action. Double-blind testing will occur in sham-stimulation controlled fashion with the device turned OFF in half of patients 4 weeks before testing. Gastric function improvements with each therapy will be correlated with symptom reductions to test if therapies that selectively target motor dysfunction or heightened visceral sensation produce greater benefits. Lay description: Nausea, vomiting and bloating are prevalent in patients with long-standing diabetes and markedly impair quality of life. These studies will provide insight into symptom pathogenesis in diabetic gastropathy and will direct future research into therapies that correct visceral sensory rather than motor defects in this condition      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

[unreadable] The second study is designed to test the hypothesis that patients with delayed solid gastric emptying will have better symptom response to temporary gastric electrical stimulation (GES) than those who are non-delayed. Specific aims for this proposal are to: (1) provide training to the Consortium's other clinical centers in the endoscopic placement of temporary GES; (2) conduct a consortium-wide randomized, double-blind clinical trial of temporary GES; (3) compare certain markers at baseline and after the use of temporary GES; (4) determine whether two of the baseline parameters, cutaneous EGG values and mucosal EGG values, can predict response to GES; and (5) based on the results of the study, develop guidelines to better identify those who would most likely benefit from permanent GES      [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",

The economic burden just for UTI hospitalizations totals $180 million. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) occurs in 35% of children with UTI, increasing the risk of infection and long-term sequelae. This proposal aims to evaluate the effectiveness of management strategies in improving outcomes of children with VUR. Continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis has become accepted therapy for children with VUR, although scant evidence is available to support this practice. Similarly, the role of subureteral endoscopic surgery has not been properly evaluated. Recent changes in practice underscore the importance of determining the efficacy of prophylactic antimicrobials. These include: 1) earlier diagnosis and treatment of UTIs resulting in reduced renal scarring, 2) parental awareness of increased antimicrobial resistance and willingness to follow a \"watchful waiting\" path; and 3) prenatal identification of functional and anatomical obstructions of the urinary tract with widespread use of ultrasound (separating these children from those diagnosed with VUR following an index UTI). This proposal consists of a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic antimicrobials in preventing renal scarring and reinfections in children aged 2-36 months old with VUR. Children with Grades l-lll VUR will be randomized to receive prophylactic antimicrobial therapy or placebo; a third arm could readily be added to evaluate the efficacy of subureteral endoscopic surgery. Children with grades IV-V VUR will receive antimicrobial prophylaxis because they have the highest risk of developing renal scarring. Children will be recruited from 1) an Acute Care Pathway and 2) a Referral Care Pathway to enhance generalizability of study findings.

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is characterized by the retrograde flow of urine up the ureter. VUR increases the risk of urinary tract infection, and approximately one-third of the children who have urinary tract infections also have VUR. Little is known about the best treatment for VUR, or whether any treatment is beneficial. The objective of the VURC study is to determine whether a specific intervention is beneficial. Candidate interventions are open surgery, endoscopic surgery, or antibiotic prophylaxis.

It has the potential for causing irreparable renal damage, particularly [sic] in younger children. Despite the widespread use of antibiotic prophylaxis in children with VUR, there are no placebo-controlled studies demonstrating its clinical benefit in preventing renal injury. The main aim of our proposed double blind, placebo-controled [sic] study is to test the hypothesis that prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis in children > 2 years old with grade I-IV VUR is unnecessary. Our study, which is a joint effort of 28 Pediatric Nephrologists and 9 Pediatric Urologists from 28 centers affiliated with the North American Pediatrics Renal Transplant Registry (NAPRTCS) and the Midwest Pediatric Nephrology Consortium (MWPNC) will test this hypothesis by recruiting 120 children up to the age of 10 years with newly diagnosed grades I-IV VUR. We propose using antibiotic prophylaxis in all eligible subjects up to the age of 2 years or a minimum of 6 months from the diagnosis of VUR (whichever comes later) and subsequently randomizing them into prophylaxis and placebo groups. Children >2 years old will be randomized directly at study entry into prophylaxis and placebo groups. Followup will include biannual clinc [sic] visits; yearly renal imaging, blood and urine tests, and assessment for dysfunctional voiding (DV) and constipation; and the measurement of glomerular filtration rate by iohexol clearance. By randomization, we will test our first hypothesis that antibiotic prophylaxis after age 2 years does not decrease the frequency of UTI, reduce the risk of renal scarring, or enhance resolution of VUR. By using objecitve [sic] scoring for DV and constipation, we will test our second hypothesis that their presence delays resolution of VUR, and increases the frequency of UTI and renal scarring, irrespective of long-term antibiotic prophylaxis. Patients who fail medical management will be randomized into Delfux or surgical reimplantation groups to test our third hypothesis that the two treatments do not differ in cure rate, recurrence rate of UTI, or risk of renal scarring.  [unreadable] Vesicoureteral reflux, the abnormal flow of urine from the bladder into the kidneys, is common in children and may cause kidney damage and high blood pressure. Current treatment uses daily antibiotics for years, but this may not be necessary and may cause some harm, inlcuding [sic] resistance to antibiotics, requiring children to have expensive and painful radiology tests and surgical procedures, and causing parental anxiety.

It is known that in some of these children, VUR is associated with recurrent infection, pyelonephritis and subsequent renal scarring. This can lead to hypertension and renal insufficiency later on in childhood or in adult life. There remains great confusion, however, regarding the optimal treatment of these children or indeed, if they all require treatment. While it appears that children with the higher grades of dilating reflux (grades IV & V) are at the greatest risk for clinical sequelae, they are a minority of patients. 90% of children have grades I, II or III reflux. The majority of children with low grade reflux will outgrow their reflux before adolescence. Surgical correction of reflux in these children is less commonly required, therefore. Rates of renal scarring and recurrent urinary tract infection are also lower in these children. While long term antibiotic prophylaxis works well in preventing urinary infection, it has been proposed that it may not be necessary in this group, since rates of scarring and recurrent infection are low with low grade reflux. Recently, a new minimally invasive treatment of reflux has been developed and a material known as \"Deflux\" has been approved by the FDA for this purpose. This material is injected via a cystoscope around the ureteral orifice. The change in configuration of the orifice caused by this bulking agent cures the reflux. Because of its ease of use and low morbidity of application, it has been proposed that this be employed as initial therapy in the majority of children with low grade reflux. Successful treatment with Deflux might render the need for long term surveillance, either on or off antibiotics unnecessary. The optimal treatment for the majority of the thousands of children with reflux, therefore, remains unknown. Do they simply require daily antibiotics? Can they be safely observed without prophylaxis? Do they require an ambulatory cystoscopic procedure? A prospective randomized study is proposed to answer this question in girls, aged one to five years with grades II or III reflux, diagnosed after a urinary tract infection. The three major treatment groups would be antibiotic prophylaxis, observation without prophylaxis, or endoscopic therapy with Deflux (ET). The clinical endpoints measured would be recurrent febrile or non-febrile urinary infections and renal scarrin      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Project Summary: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common serious bacterial infection in childhood, affecting approximately 3% of all children by six years of age. The current standard of care for young children who present with UTI is to perform a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) to evaluate for the presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a condition that is present in approximately 30-40% of children with UTI and is thought to increase the risk of renal scarring. Traditionally, children with VUR identified on VCUG are treated with daily prophylactic antibiotics until the VUR resolves, or have surgical correction of the VUR. Recently the role of VUR in contributing to renal scarring and the utility of VCUG, prophylactic antibiotics and VUR surgery have been questioned. Concerns have also been raised about the cost and potential harms of VCUGs and daily prophylactic antibiotics. In this U01 application we propose a multi-center, centrally randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, equivalence trial to determine whether, in the setting of prompt recognition of UTI symptoms and early treatment of confirmed UTI, prophylactic antibiotics are better than placebo in reducing renal scarring; and whether DMSA evidence of renal scarring or pyelonephritis at presentation of UTI modifies the effect of prophylactic antibiotics. We will also determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis increases the rate of gastrointestinal (Gl) colonization with antibiotic resistant E.coli and Klebsiella spp. and Gl colonization with Pseudomonas spp. Recognizing that the protocols implemented by the Clinical Trial Centers (CTCs) selected for this U01 will be developed by concensus [sic], this application also describes the strengths that the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) brings as a potential CTC in the NIDDK's Clinical Study of Vesicoureteral Reflux. These include (1) content area expertise and experience recruiting and retaining patients in large clinical studies, (2) a vast pediatric healthcare network of primary care and urology practices from which to recruit patients, (3) a network-wide state-of-the-art searchable electronic medical record and billing system suitable for identifying potential participants, and (4) an institutional commitment to and infrastructure for conducting the highest quality clinical research.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) is a common condition seen among children with urinary tract infection (UTI). VUR is associated with serious conditions including acute pyelonephritis and permanent renal injury, leading to scarring, renal impairment (\"reflux nephropathy\") and end-stage renal disease. However, the optimal treatment for VUR remains unclear. Both prophylactic antibiotics and surgical correction have been widely implemented for management of children with VUR, but neither of these has been shown in prospective randomized trials to be superior in outcomes to surveillance, and both may have significant risks. The proposed research will identify the optimal initial management approach for children diagnosed with VUR, by comparing non-intervention (surveillance), prophylactic antibiotics, and surgical correction (endoscopic injection of bulking agent) in a prospective, randomized trial. In a multi-center collaboration of five clinical treatment centers and one data center, over 2 years we will enroll 600 patients with VUR (ages 10 years or less), and follow them for 2.5-4.5 years. This study will identify differences in incidence of UTI, reflux nephropathy, and other outcomes. The Brady Urological Institute and the Division of Pediatric Nephrology at Johns Hopkins Hospital are uniquely suited to the execution of the proposed research, with an integrated multi-disciplinary research team, extensive experience in the design and execution of multi-center clinical research, and substantive clinical caseload and experience in treatment of children with VUR. Much of the current management of VUR is based on case series and anecdotes. The information gained from this research has the potential to dramatically change clinical practice, by providing definitive evidence of the optimal initial management of children with VUR.  [unreadable] Urinary tract infections in children account for over a million doctor visits per year, and 30,000-40,000 hospitalizations per year. Many of these children have vesico-ureteral reflux (a condition where urine improperly flows backwards out of the bladder toward the kidney), and this may predispose these children to urinary infections. While vesico-ureteral relux [sic] can be corrected surgically, it is unclear whether this is beneficial; this research study will compare several management approaches to vesicoureteral reflux to determine which is best      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable] Epidemiological, physiological and pharmacological evidence support a potential pathogenic link leading sequentially from obesity-inflammation-\"insulin resistance->type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. Our basic science findings indicate that the inflammatory link is mediated by activation of the transcriptional master switch, NF-KB. Following our goals to translate basic findings to the clinic, we have identified anti-inflammatory salicylates as a potential new class of drugs for the treatment of these disorders through inhibition of the IKK[unreadable]/NF-?B pathway. Preliminary results from 2- to 4-week long, single-site clinical trials in T2D patients showed that high-doses of either aspirin (7 g/day) or salsalate (3.0 to 4.5 g/day) have pronounced and highly significant effects on many metabolic parameters, including reductions in fasting and postprandial glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and hepatic glucose production and improvements in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. This application aims to progress past the \\'proof-of-principle\\' stage to determine whether IKK[unreadable]/NF-?B inhibition in general and salsalate therapy in particular might provide new avenues for treating patients with diabetes. We propose a double-masked, placebo-controlled trial for assessing the efficacy of salsalate, a safe and FDA-approved drug, initially dosed at 3.0 g/day and escalating as tolerated to 4.0 g/day. Patients with documented but poorly controlled T2D (7.0%< HbA1c < 9.5%), currently being treated with diet and exercise in combination with either SFU or metformin, will be continued on their current therapy. Following a 4-week single-mask placebo run-in period, subjects will be randomized to receive placebo vs. salsalate orally for a 26-week trial period. The proposed primary endpoint is an improvement in HbA1c. Other measures of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome will also be monitored, including blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels, cholesterol and triglyceride panels, free fatty acids, blood pressure, and circulating markers and potential mediators of inflammation. While thought to be very low, the risk of potential side effects will be carefully monitored. These studies ask for the first time whether directly targeting inflammation, in this case by specifically inhibiting the IKK/NF-?B axis with salsalate (salicylate), provides new avenues for treating patients with diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.

The diagnosis is often considered in patients with biliary-type pain who have previously undergone cholecystectomy. The Evaluating Predictors & Interventions in Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction (EPISOD) trial is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled multi-center trial with a maximum of 214 randomized subjects who have received a prior cholecystectomy and are diagnosed with the clinical syndrome of SOD (as defined by the Rome III criteria). Subjects will be selected with severe pain-related disability (Grade 3 or 4 on the RAPID instrument), with no objective signs of biliary or pancreatic disease (i.e. SOD type III). The overall goal is to assess the value of endoscopic sphincterotomy as a treatment for adult subjects categorized as SOD III suffering from pain after cholecystectomy. Success is defined as Grade 1 pain-related disability (little or no disability during a 90-day period) on the RAPID at 9 and 12 months post-procedure. Subjects and study team members will be blind to treatment assignment. A 2:1 randomization allocation in favor of sphincterotomy and stratified by results of sphincter manometry (SOM - abnormal/normal) and center will be used. The following secondary aims will be assessed: 1) evaluate the relationship between the results of SOM (abnormal/normal), and the primary outcome (success/failure); 2) in the sub group of patients with manometrically proven PSH, evaluate the success rate of subjects who receive biliary sphincterotomy alone versus subjects who receive dual sphincterotomy; 3) evaluate the effects of pre-specified clinical prognostic factors on the primary outcome; 4) evaluate anxiety and depression scores over time and their relation to study outcomes; and 5) evaluate the economic impact of SOD III and endoscopic sphincterotomy in patients with SOD III. In addition, for a subset of eligible patients who decline randomization, a careful follow-up study (EPISOD2) of standard of care treatment will be conducted to assist in the interpretation and assessment of generalizability of the EPISOD primary aim as well as several of the secondary aims.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] In our previous work we have demonstrated that genetic factors controlling the production of bradykinin (BK) and nitric oxide (NO) influence greatly the development of renal complications in mice made diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ) or by the Akita diabetogenic C86Y mutation in Ins 2. We also showed that diabetic nephropathy and several indicators of senescence increase progressively in the order wildtype < bradykinin receptor B2 null < Akita diabetic < B2 receptor null Akita diabetic. 8-OHdG content, point mutations and deletions in mitochondrial (mt) DNA increased in the same progression, as did indicators of oxidative stress. We now propose three specific aims and the generation of two new mouse models to determine the interplay between genetic factors that influence BK action, the production of NO, and diabetes-related increases in mutations in mtDNA. Specific aim 1 will determine the effect on diabetic complications of eliminating both BK receptors throughout the body, or in a tissue or cell specific manner; the effects of reducing oxidative stress in these mice will also be determined. Specific aim 2 will investigate the relationship between glomerular damage and mtDNA mutations in eNOS -/- diabetic mice in which we have found that oxidative stress is paradoxically less than in eNOS +/+ diabetic mice. Specific aim 3 will test the hypothesis that increasing the frequency of mtDNA mutations by introducing a proof reading defect into mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma will exacerbate the complications in Akita diabetic mice even though oxidative stress is not further increased over that due to the diabetes alone.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] During the first phase of the AMDCC our group at TJU studied the decorin KO diabetic mouse. Our hypothesis was that decorin acts as an endogenous protective factor by inhibiting active TGF-b. We found that decorin is indeed protective, as decorin KO mice had accelerated kidney disease and surprisingly increased mortality. Based on our results, the AMDCC investigators as a group chose the decorin KO diabetic mouse as a leading success during the 1st funding period. Of major mechanistic interest, we found that decorin KO diabetic mice that died exhibited evidence of renal insufficiency and low plasma adiponectin levels, months prior to mortality. This is similar to the human clinical condition. Low adiponectin levels are a powerful biomarker of increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with kidney disease. Additionally, the decorin KO mice had increased NADPH oxidase (Nox4) expression in the kidney which may contribute to more severe nephropathy. In the next phase of the AMDCC, we propose test the following hypotheses. 1. Deficiency of adiponectin in combination with lack of decorin leads to enhanced lethality and diabetic nephropathy and 2. Increased Nox4 in vascular smooth muscle cells enhances diabetic nephropathy and the vascular complications of diabetic kidney disease. We propose to generate new diabetic mouse models by crossing adiponectin KO mice with decorin KO mice and by generating mice transgenic for smooth muscle Nox4 using the SM22 promoter. Diabetes will be induced by crossing with Akita mice. These mice will be characterized for diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular disease. Both new models will be fully characterized for diabetic nephropathy. More importantly, we propose a series of interventional studies to test the causal role of TGF-b, adiponectin, and Nox4 in the pathogenesis of accelerated diabetic nephropathy. Key features we will focus on include matrix accumulation, renal function, autoregulation, and mortality. The proposed studies are directly related to the human condition, in which TGF-(, adiponectin, and Nox4 are key biomarkers for worse disease, but their pathogenetic role is unproven. Our findings will advance our mechanistic understanding of diabetic nephropathy and vascular disease and may lead to better biomarkers and novel treatments.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

The lipid accumulation is associated with development of robust glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and proteinuria. We have also found that the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) is highly expressed in the kidney and the expression of FXR and its target enzymes is decreased in the diabetic kidney. Furthermore we have determined that FXR is an important regulator of SREBP-1 and ChREBP expression as well as oxidative stress, advanced glycation end products (AGEs/RAGE), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and fibrosis inducing growth factors.   Hypothesis: Based on these finding we propose that FXR plays an important role on the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. We hypothesize that deletion of FXR will markedly enhance and overexpression of FXR will attenuate diabetic nephropathy in mouse models of type 1 (OVE26) and type 2 (db/db) diabetes.   Mouse Model 1: A) We will generate FXR knockout mice, currently on the C57BI/6 genetic background, on Background: In a) OVE26 mice with type 1 diabetes, b) C57BI/6 mice with diet induced obesity and insulin the FVB, and if need be and DBA/2J genetic backgrounds, 2 genetic backgrounds that have been documented to have increased susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy. B) We will then cross breed FXR KO mice on FVB background with i) OVE26 mice (type 1 diabetes) on FVB background or ii) db/db mice (type 2 diabetes) on FVB background to determine if FXR deletion accentuates and accelerates diabetic nephropathy. C) We will generate renal podocyte specific FXR knockout mice on FVB background using the Lox-Cre approach (FXRf/f mice crossed with Nphs2 Cre mice). D) We will then crossbreed podocyte FXR KO mice with i) OVE26 mice or ii) db/db mice.

B) We will then crossbreed the podocyte specific FXR transgenic mice with OVE26 or db/db mice to determine if increased expression of FXR attenuates or prevents diabetic nephropathy.   Phenotyping: In these mice we will determine a) the manifestation of diabetic nephropathy, including glomerular filtration rate, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and proteinuria and b) the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that mediate diabetic renal injury including lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and AGEs/RAGE.

       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In humans with diabetes, abnormal angiogenesis contributes to the development of end-organ damage. In this regard, \"excessive\" angiogenesis and increased activity of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway have been associated with diabetic complications such as retinopathy. In contrast, an inadequate angiogenesis response with a reduced capacity to promote collateral blood vessel growth in cardiac and particularly peripheral skeletal muscle result in more severe manifestations of vascular disease in diabetes. However, the mechanisms responsible for the loss of control of angiogenesis in diabetes and how this dysregulation modulates tissue pathology are not clear. We hypothesize that abnormal signaling in VEGF-associated pathways is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications including peripheral artery disease (PAD) and nephropathy. Furthermore, we posit that distinct properties of individual tissues determine the effects of diabetes on the local angiogenesis response, shaping the resulting pathology. Accordingly, to develop better models of diabetic PAD and nephropathy, we will generate mouse lines with inducible alterations of angiogenic signaling pathways targeted to specific cell lineages in blood vessels, skeletal muscle and kidney. Because both enhanced and diminished VEGF activities have independently been associated with diabetic complications, we will produce models with up- or down-regulated angiogenic signaling. The long-term goals of our studies are: (1) To understand how alterations in angiogenic factors contribute to the development of diabetic complications and (2) To develop mouse models of diabetic PAD and nephropathy that more faithfully reproduce the respective human conditions. To achieve these goals we propose the following specific aims: 1. To develop mouse models with genetic modifications of key signaling pathways linked to angiogenesis. 2. To determine the effects of diabetes on angiogenic signaling in a well-established model of peripheral artery disease. 3. To define the consequences of altered angiogenic signaling on the development of albuminuria and nephropathy in diabetes.      ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Valid murine models of diabetic nephropathy (DN) should replicate the molecular changes and not simply the pathological alterations of patients with DN. Thus, our general hypothesis for development and testing of murine models of diabetic nephropathy is that Current murine models fail to show human-like DN because they fail to replicate glomerular and tubulointerstital gene expression changes that occur in humans with progressive DN. Replication of the critical transcriptomic profiles of patients with progressive DN should induce progressive DN in mice. Our use of data in human DN generated by the European Renal cDNA Bank (ERCB) will be critical in testing and validating the mouse models of the Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium. We have performed initial transcriptomic analyses of humans with DN using the ERCB to identify pathways which are reliably altered in humans but not in murine models. One pathway that is consistently altered in glomeruli and tubulointerstium in diabetes in humans, but not in mice, is the JAK/STAT pathway. Expression of all JAK members was increased when confirmed with real time PCR analysis. We have focused on JAK2 given its key role in mediating responses implicated in DN. Moreover, JAK2 is activated by reactive oxygen species and interacts with PPAR( signaling, both of which are implicated in DN. For our 2 novel models, we propose podocyte and proximal tubular-specific Jak2 transgenic db/m C57BLKS mice. For these and other models in the Consortium we propose to:  [unreadable] 1. Determine whether transcriptional changes in humans are reproduced in the glomerular and tubulointersitial compartments of the Jak2//db/db BLKS models, and other AMDCC models;   [unreadable] 2.

Our general strategic approach is to accelerate glucose-mediated oxidative injury in neurons in genetic models of type 2 diabetes. While many gene products participate in this process, we will concentrate on targeting 2 enzymes involved in superoxide detoxification: mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase. Our initial approach will concentrate on developing 2 Cre-loxP models on a susceptible genetic background. In parallel, we propose 2 hypothesis-driven specific aims for discovering the basic pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying DN. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that decreased catalase activity in sensory neurons will make these neurons more susceptible to glucose-mediated injury. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that animal models with DN have morphological and biochemical markers of increased oxidative stress in the peripheral nervous system. Information gained from this application will lead to new insights into the pathogenesis of DN and allow for the development of more relevant murine models of this disabling complication.  [unreadable] Relevance to Public Health: 20 million Americans are diabetic and the incidence is increasing by 5% each year. Although DN is a common and highly morbid condition, there are no treatments for DN outside of control of the diabetic condition itself. Our studies will identify cellular targets for treatment of DN and have the potential to benefit all patients with diabetes.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable] Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, prevalent, often disabling, GI disorder for which there is no reliable and satisfactory medical option for its full range of symptoms (abdominal pain, bowel dysfunction). An accumulating body of evidence indicates that a specific psychosocial treatment called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is associated with significant reductions in IBS symptoms and related difficulties. Despite its apparent efficacy, CBT\\'s clinical effectiveness (i.e., its generalizability, feasibility, cost effectiveness) has not been adequately established due partly to its duration, cost, and limited accessibility. As the \"second generation\" of IBS treatments undergo development and validation, it has become increasingly clear that efficacy demonstration is a necessary but not sufficient condition of treatment viability. In a pilot study funded under NIDDK\\'s R03 mechanism, we addressed these problems by developing a briefer, largely self administered version of CBT that requires only 4, I hr clinic visits. Our RCT data showed that a 10 session version of CBT can be translated into a 4 session version without compromising patient acceptability or short term efficacy. It is unclear whether treatment effects are maintained long term (out to 12 months), due to theoretical change mechanisms (vs. nonspecific factors common across different forms of therapy), are more pronounced among specific subgroups of patients, or, generalize to a large sample of Rome III diagnosed patients treated by different investigative sites. We seek to address these questions by conducting a larger, more definitive, multisite RCT that will recruit from 3 treatment sites 480 patients with moderate to severe IBS and assess their acute and long term response to brief (4 session) CBT, extended (10 session) CBT, or a credible attention placebo. We will use the first year to develop a clinical infrastructrue [sic] to ensure the success and integrity of the proposed trial. In the short term, a successful trial will lend empirical validation to a self administered version of CBT that retains the efficacy of standard CBT but is more transportable, accessible to patients outside of research protocols, and less costly to deliver. In the long term, we hope to show that a self guided behavioral treatment program is an effective and efficient treatment delivery system that can enhance the quality of patient care, improve clinical outcomes, and decrease the economic and personal costs of one of the most prevalent and intractable GI disorders. The primary goal of the proposed trial is to assess the short- and long-term efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for irritable bowel syndrome using two treatment delivery systems (self administered, therapist administered). Secondary aims seek to specify the conditions under which CBT may (or may not) achieve its effects (moderator questions), why and how these effects are achieved (mediator questions) and at what economic cost. Long term project goals are to develop an effective self-administered behavioral treatment program that can enhance the quality of patient care, improve clinical outcomes, and decrease the economic and personal costs of one of the most prevalent and intractable GI disorders.

       " \"This proposal is the logical continuation of an exploratory collaborative grant (R21,Herold - von Herrath) focused to develop novel combinatorial approaches of recent-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D). Forthcoming results in two independent diabetes models (NOD and RIP-LCMV) have established the concept that, in order to achieve antigen-specific tolerance, combination of immunization with islet antigens and systemically acting immune modulators can exhibit strong synergy and be clinically beneficial for the following reasons: First, reversion of hyperglycemia can occur at lower dosages of the systemically acting immune modulator, in our case anti-CD3 Fab'2. Second, mechanistically, the induction of Tregs specific for islet antigens that can mediate long-term tolerance and bystander suppression is enhanced. This project seeks to deepen our mechanistic insight, and, in close collaboration with projects 2 and 3, address crucial issues that should facilitate translation of combinatorial therapy in recent-onset T1D to the clinic. Wewill answer the following questions:  1. Which is the optimal combinatorial therapeutic regimen in recent-onset T1D in vivo? Current  data indicate that oral or nasal administration of insulin peptides bears most promise. In order to  optimally tie into current choices in drug development, we will define the best candidate. In  addition we will explore combination of antigen-specific therapy with GLP-1 agonists and gastrin  to regenerate beta cells.  2. Which precise functions define the action of the islet antigen induced Tregs in vivo? Current  findings show that long-term tolerance after anti-CD3 and antigen administration is, to a large  part, due to induction of potent islet antigen-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs) that can transfer  tolerance to recipients with recent-onset T1D. Their precise mechanism of action will be defined  using novel technology and reagents recently acquired, RNAi and ins-TcR transgenic mice.  3. Which are optimal in vitro assays to monitor Tregs and antigen-sepcific tolerance in vivo? We  will establish asays that reflect and predict the clinical out come on a per-animal basis. These  assays should provide strong guidance to the goals of the clinical project (#3, Herold).\",\n",
       " 'Studies proposed in this competing renewalapplication intend to identify the mechanisms of effect that allow (1) systemic administration of anti-CD3 antibody with or without selected TLR engagement or (2) the generation of, or adoptive transfer of, regulatory T cells (Tregs), to block progression to diabetes in pre- diabetic or recent onset hyperglycemic NOD mice. The hypothesis being studied is that these proposed therapies share a final common pathway ofeffect.  Mechanistic studies in this proposal will use cDNA microarray and novel methods of protein expression available in Core B, to compare gene and protein expression patterns seen in treated mice to those seen in normal NOD disease progression when comparedto patterns seen in non-inflamed NOD.810 tissues (NOD Roadmap data from previous U19 contract),to identify the mechanism(s)of the observedtherapeutic effect. Identification, analysis and characterization of gene and protein expression patterns seen following successful therapy of NOD mice should provide important insights into mechanism of effect, identify surrogate markersof effect, and potentially provide additional or alternative targets for therapy.  According to our preliminary data obtained under previous U19 funding, two major phenomenon occur following successful therapy of recently hyperglycemic NOD mice; (1) a change in the immune response profile of islet-infiltrating T cells leading to a reorganization of the gene and protein expression patterns and the architecture of the infiltrating T cells, co-incident with inhibition of the autoimmune destruction of beta cells, and (2) pancreatic beta cell regeneration (wound healing) as a consequence of this change. Four Specific Aims have been proposed to test the following hypothesis: administration of endotoxin contaminated anti-CD3 antibody or adoptive cellular therapy, using Tregs or local TGFp production, acting directly on autpreactive lymphocytes present in the islets and draining lymph nodes, or, as we believe, by activating Tregs, either directly, or secondarily blocks islet beta cell destruction and facilitates islet beta cell regeneration as a form of wound healing.  These studies have direct impact on one current therapy of recent onset diabetes in man, the use of anti-CD3 antibodies. Despite extremely successful treatment of recent onset hyperglycemic NOD mice with anti-CD3 antibodies, responses seen in the human trials have been less than spectacular. If our preliminary data are correct, that contaminant endotoxin in the anti-CD3 antibodies used in the mouse model was synergistic, the concept of using TLR agonists in synergy with endotoxin free anti-human-CDS antibodies may provide a major therapeutic advance in the treatment of recent onset or pre-diabetic human disease.',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is the induction of tolerance simultaneously to both renal and pancreatic islet transplants across an allogeneic barrier in baboons. The studies are based upon the following previous observations: 1) tolerance to fully mismatched renal allografts can be achieved in juvenile miniature swine by a short course of high-dose tacrolimus, and preliminary data indicate that this methodology is also successful in juvenile baboons; 2) in contrast to free islet grafts, composite \"islet kidneys\" (I-K), prepared by transplantation of autologous swine islets under the kidney capsule two months prior to transplantation of the composite organ into nephrectomized, pancreatectomized allogeneic recipients, restore euglycemia immediately and maintain both renal and islet function long-term; and 3) tolerance to renal allografts can be achieved in adult animals by induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism. We propose here to extend these studies to the induction of tolerance to I-K in baboons, with the intent of developing a clinically relevant treatment protocol for end stage diabetic nephropathy. Specifically, we will: 1) Establish a non-human primate model of renal allograft tolerance in juvenile baboons; 2) Assess the association of biologic and molecular markers with tolerance and rejection in baboons undergoing tolerance-induction protocols; 3) Test the ability of composite islet-kidney transplants to treat both diabetes and renal failure in nephrectomized, juvenile baboons, made diabetic through STZ treatment; and 4) Extend treatment of diabetes and renal failure by I-K transplantation to adult baboons using tolerance induction through a mixed chimerism approach and assess the validity of biologic and molecular biomarkers of tolerance induction developed in Aim 2 for assessment of tolerance induction. We anticipate that the combination of tolerance induction and the use of pre-vascularized islets in these approaches could provide a new and effective treatment modality for patients with type I diabetes and end-stage renal disease.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable] Vascular access dysfunction is associated with patient morbidity and mortality, is a leading reason for hospitalization among dialysis patients, and is estimated to have annual associated costs in the United States that exceed 1 billion dollars. The arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred type of vascular access due to substantially lower thrombosis rates, infection rates, and total health care expenditures. Recognition of these advantages is reflected in clinical practice guidelines as well as clinical performance measures utilized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Indeed, CMS has launched a major initiative to increase the prevalence of AVF (Fistula First). However, the numerous advantages associated with functional AVF are counterbalanced by the recognition that a substantially higher proportion of fistulas than grafts are never able to be used for dialysis due to failure to mature adequately to support the blood flows needed for effective hemodialysis. There is now substantial evidence that uremia is accompanied by increased oxidative stress, and inflammation, leading to endothelial dysfunction and structural changes in the vascular system which includes aggressive development of venous intimal hyperplasia. However, the extent to which these uremia-related functional and structural changes in the vasculature contribute to failure of AVF maturation is currently unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that uremia-related functional and structural alterations in the vasculature can be identified which will predict the probability of AV fistula maturation. To examine this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1. To determine whether physiologic measures of endothelial function can predict outcomes of newly created native AV fistulae. For this aim, vascular function will be evaluated prior to surgical creation of native fistulae using well- established, non-invasive methods: a) assessment of brachial artery flow mediated and nitroglycerin-induced dilation, b) fingertip tonometric measurement of pulse amplitude, c) arterial pulse wave velocity as a measure of arterial stiffness, and d) forearm venous distensibility by strain-gauge plethysmography; 2. To determine whether venous structural changes can predict outcomes of newly created native AV fistulae; and 3. To determine whether plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction can predict outcomes of newly created native AV fistulae.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

However, the long-term sequelae of AKI have not been thoroughly explored. Although AKI has been widely considered a reversible disease, studies now suggest that AKI may cause or contribute to progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There is also growing evidence that AKI has long-term effects on overall survival; even many years after recovery from an episode AKI, patients suffer from premature death. We, the Translational Research Investigating Biomarkers in AKI Network (TRIBE-AKI Network), propose to conduct a landmark prospective cohort study of 1,800 patients (adult and pediatric) undergoing cardiac surgery at seven academic centers. We will study the entire cohort for the development of ESRD and death over time. Additionally, we will intensively follow 300 AKI patients and 300 randomly selected non-AKI patients for a mean of 4 years (range 3 to 5 years) in order to understand the long-term effects of AKI on the progression of kidney disease (change in glomerular filtration rate as determined by change in serum creatinine and change in serum cystatin C). The proposed study will be an extension of an NIH-funded study (R01-HL08676, funding from 04/07- 3/12) that is validating the role of newer biomarkers of AKI in the setting of cardiac surgery. The aims of this longitudinal study are: 1) to determine whether AKI is associated with accelerated decline in kidney function; 2) to determine the composite risk of ESRD and all-cause mortality in patients after AKI as defined by creatinine-based definitions of AKI; and 3) to evaluate the prognostic value of elevations in serum cystatin C and urinary biomarker concentrations (IL-18, NGAL) for the future development of ESRD and for mortality. The overall goals of this project are to determine the long-term associations between AKI and CKD and long-term mortality. We hypothesize that AKI will increase progression to CKD and contribute to premature death, and that the new biomarkers of AKI will be predictive of these outcomes.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable] The national initiatives to increase the use of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) have had the unintended consequences of increasing the AVF non-maturation (approximately 30%)and catheter usage rates (27%). Multiple factors have been identified to contribute to the non-maturation of AVFs. The quality of the inflow artery and the outflow vein are likely foremost among these factors, however, they are not sufficient alone to predict successful maturation. The increased flow velocity that results from the AVF leads an increase of shear stress that serves as stimulus for both the artery and outflow vein to dilate. The mechanism by which shear stress modulates AVF maturation remains unknown. Overall Hypothesis - Shear stress, as modulated by the local and systemic milieu, predicts maturation/non- maturation of the AVF. Specific aim 1: Determine the factors that predict AVF maturation/non-maturation in cooperation with the other centers in the consortium. Approach: Develop a protocol to identify the specific factors associated with AVF maturation/non-maturation and their underlying mechanisms. Specific aim 2: Determine the contribution of the baseline characteristics of the artery to AVF maturation/non-maturation. Approach: Brachial artery distensibility and flow mediated dilation (endothelial-dependent) will be determined prior to the creation of the AVF using ultrasound. Specific aim 3: Determine the contribution of the systemic inflammatory response and endothelial cell dysfunction on AVF maturation/non-maturation. Approach: The plasma levels CRP, IL-6,MCP-1, slCAM-1, and circulating endothelial cells will be measured throughout the perioperative period. Specific aim 4: Determine the critical interplay between shear stress and the local/systemic milieu on maturation/non-maturation. Approach: The inflow artery proximal to the AVF anastomosis and the outflow vein will be imaged with high-resolution ultrasound throughout the perioperative period. Diameter and velocity changes will be assessed and both AVF flow and shear stress calculated. The protocol will identify the factors that lead to successful development of arteriovenous fistulas, the enlarged blood vessels used to connect patients to the hemodialysis machine. This will significantly improve the overall quality of life for patients on dialysis.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

AKI is a common and serious complication in hospitalized patients. The incidence of AKI has increased dramatically over the past several decades based on information from large Medicare databases suggesting an increase in the number of cases by 11% per year. Whereas in-hospital complications of AKI have been extensively studied, the long-term sequelae of AKI, specifically its contribution to the development and progression of CKD leading to end-stage renal disease, have not been thoroughly evaluated. The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: SPECIFIC AIM #1: To examine the independent risk of prior history of AKI on chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in a long-term prospective cohort study of critically ill patients. We hypothesize that the diagnosis of AKI is associated with a higher rate of progression of CKD (after the recovery of the acute illness) compared to no diagnosis of AKI in subjects admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). SPECIFIC AIM #2: To examine the independent risk of a prior history of AKI on the development of increased oxidative stress, chronic inflammation and progressive cardiovascular disease in a long-term prospective cohort study of critically ill patients. We hypothesize that AKI causes an increased oxidative stress burden and contributes to the chronic inflammatory response and worsened cardiovascular risk profiles of affected patients in the ICU compared to those without the diagnosis of AKI in the ICU. SPECIFIC AIM #3: a) To compare the relative and combined predictive capacities of a biomarker panel in the early diagnosis of AKI in high-risk critically ill patients; b) To determine if the same biomarker panel predicts the severity of AKI (need for renal replacement therapy, dialysis-free survival) and other clinically-relevant outcomes (mortality and ICU/hospital length of stay). We hypothesize that: 1) a biomarker panel that includes kidney specific markers of injury, such as urine IL-18, NGAL, F2- isoprostanes, and serum/urine cystatin C obtained at the time of enrollment will be superior to a single marker in diagnosing AKI based on AKIN criteria in a susceptible population of patients in the ICU; ii) Same biomarker panel will be superior to a single marker in predicting severity of AKI and other clinically-relevant outcomes. In order to achieve the proposed aims, we will recruit 500 subjects from a unique and novel resource, the Validation of biomarkers in Acute Lung Injury Diagnosis (VALID) study, a large (2550 subject) prospective observational cohort of a heterogeneous critically ill population followed throughout their ICU and remaining hospital stay.

The CBL is responsible for providing participating clinical sites with the reagents, supplies, shippers and protocols needed for performing iohexol based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) studies and transporting blood to the University of Rochester laboratory for analysis of key kidney determinants, including Cr, BUN, electrolytes, glucose, Ca, P, intact PTH, vitamin D, CRP, lipid screen, and cystatin C. Similarly, urine is collected and transported for protein, creatinine, and microalbumin to assess the nature of kidney damage. The CBL also provides reagents, shippers, and instructions to all participating sites for submission of blood, plasma, sera, urine, hair and nail samples to NIH repositories. In conjunction with the Clinical Coordinating Centers, the CBL provides training of coordinators and investigators of each participating site, information and instruction concerning the conduct of each study visit, expertise in the biochemical methodology and clinical interpretation of these analyses. The CBL collaborates with the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to optimize the GFR studies, better understand the progression of chronic kidney disease, provide clinical correlation with epidemiological projections, establish quality control of all assays, and generate new formulas to estimate GFR during visits when an iohexol study is not performed. The CBL regularly participates at Steering Committee meetings and conference calls as well as in the generation of abstracts, presentations, and manuscripts in order to contribute to and document the success of the CKiD study. The CBL's effort in the CKiD study is summarized in five specific aims. First, continue to provide accurate, precise, and most efficient measures of  [unreadable] iohexol-based GFR, because it is the key independent variable against which measures of growth,  [unreadable] cardiovascular disease, and neurocognition are examined. Second, continue to provide accurate and precise measurements of general kidney health status, utilizing biochemical assays in a licensed clinical laboratory with appropriate quality controls. Third, work closely with the DCC to provide accurate estimates of GFR and determine time-dependent changes in GFR during visits when iohexol GFR is not performed. Fourth, continue to improve and streamline the iohexol-based GFR measurement to maintain recruitment and retention of CKiD subjects. Fifth, continue to provide to the participating clinical sites laboratory kits for the collection and handling of samples, accurately receive, process, and analyze these samples on a daily basis, and provide timely data entry into the CKiD web-based data base for access by the participating clinical sites, Clinical Coordinating Centers, and Data Coordinating Center.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable] Arteriovenous (AV) fistula non-maturation is currently a huge clinical problem and a major cause of morbidity and increased costs in the hemodialysis population. Although AV fistulae are the preferred mode of dialysis access they have a very high incidence of maturation failure due to a juxta-anastomotic venous stenosis. This results in multiple endovascular and surgical procedures, together with prolonged catheter dependence (the latter often resulting in sepsis). Despite the magnitude of the clinical problem, however, we currently nave no way of predicting which patients are at high risk of AV fistula non-maturation. The central objective of the current proposal is to identify predictive markers for AV fistula success or failure. In the longer term, we believe that the mechanistic information obtained from this work, will allow for the development of novel therapies to enhance AV fistula maturation. We plan to address our central objective through a prospective, cohort, observational study which will enroll upto 1200 patients who require a new AV fistula over 6-8 clinical sites. In Specific Aim 1, we will assess the impact of clinical markers such as demographics, co-morbidities, vessel size and previous vascular access history on AV fistula maturation and patency. In Specific Aim 2, we will study the relationship between hemodynamic markers such as blood flow, physical examination, the angle of the AV anastomosis and hemodynamic shear stress on AV fistula maturation. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will examine the role of biological markers such as oxidative stress and endothelial function on AV fistula maturation. Logistic regression analyses will be performed to identify both individual predictors and groups of predictors for AV fistula non-maturation. We will also use this data to develop clinician friendly \"risk scores\" for use both prior to surgery and after AV fistula placement. We believe that the current proposal will allow us to stratify patients requiring a new dialysis access into high and low risk groups. Patients in the high risk group would then either be targeted for aggressive follow up and intervention or considered for alternate forms of dialysis access (PTFE grafts). Looking to the future, we also hope that the mechanistic information obtained from this study will allow us to develop novel therapeutic interventions to enhance AV fistula maturation. This could reduce the huge clinical and economic burden currently associated with AV fistula non-maturation. Relevance to Public Health: A better understanding of the factors responsible for AV fistula stenosis could allow us to develop better ways of predicting, monitoring and treating all forms of vascular stenosis including coronary, carotid and peripheral vascular disease.

The Univ. of Utah will participate as a Clinical Center to conduct a prospective multi-center observational cohort study, investigating factors associated with the failure of AVF to mature. Major hypotheses are:(1) The usability of native AVF in CKD and dialysis patients can be predicted by a number of pre-, peri- and post-operative factors. (2) Defining these factors will allow the development of algorithms that are superior to physical examination alone in predicting AVF usability. (3) The blood flow rate and depth of the AVF determined by ultrasound at certain post-placement time points can serve as a surrogate for the usability of AVF. Specific Aims are to: (1) determine the pre-, peri- and post-operative local and/or systemic factors associated with AVF failure and the prevalence of these factors; (2) identify and evaluate intermediate outcomes as potential surrogates for AVF usability; (3) participate in the design and execution of the multi-center study. Other Aims are to: (4) determine the medical complications associated with the unusable AVF; (5) propose as ancillary studies the values of very early (3-hr) ultrasound results, plasma inflammation markers and novel platelet markers as predictors of AVF failure. Strengths of this application are: (1) a dedicated, multi-disciplinary team of researchers, with experience in clinical care of dialysis patients and AVF, and in clinical and laboratory research related to vascular access and kidney diseases; (2) a sizable independent academic dialysis program under the direction of the PI that would ensure maximum cooperation from the dialysis staff; (3) as Co-investigators, a surgical team that integrates vascular surgery with interventional radiology, vascular diagnostic tests and research; (4) integration of clinical and laboratory research that should facilitate the exploration of novel biological principles and therapies. Successful development of a prediction algorithm for AVF failure will help to guide the clinical practice of whether, when and how to place, monitor and/or implement corrective actions for the AVF. Identification of risk factors for usability failure and establishment of an objective biological surrogate for usability would facilitate the design of interventional trials targeting modifiable factors. Further, the pursuit of novel factors may promote the understanding of the pathogenesis of AVF failure that could potentially lead to new therapeutic strategies.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Its clinical and public health importance is underscored by recent studies showing a rising incidence over time. Previous studies AKI have primarily focused only on outcomes during the AKI hospitalization, with little known about long-term outcomes, including risk of development and acceleration of chronic kidney disease, death and recurrent AKI. In response to RFA-DK- 07-009 \"Ancillary Studies in the Natural History of Acute Kidney Injury,\" we propose to establish a Clinical Center as part of the Acute Kidney Injury Natural History Consortium. We will contribute 200 case subjects who suffered AKI and 200 matched controls. Our application is an ancillary study to ongoing NIDDK-sponsored clinical studies of AKI at Kaiser Permanente of Northern California and UCSF (R01 DK67126). Our four Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To sequentially determine the trajectory of kidney function for up to 4 years among patients who suffer acute kidney injury compared with appropriately matched controls. Aim 2: To assess the risks of death, cardiovascular events and other outcomes for up to 4 years between patients who suffer acute kidney injury compared with appropriately matched controls. Aim 3: To identify and/or validate biomarkers or other risk assessment tools for patients who will develop or have worsening chronic kidney disease, or other significant long-term morbidity or mortality after an episode of acute kidney injury. Aim 4: To contribute to a new central repository to preserve the data and biological samples to share with the scientific community for future analyses and/or biomarker studies in acute kidney injury.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Research on Health Care (CRHC) Data Center at the University of Pittsburgh proposes to coordinate data collection and management, study monitoring, training and quality control, and shared research services across sites as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the HALT-Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) Trials. The HALT-PKD trials comprise 2 randomized clinical trials conducted at 7 clinical sites supported by a central imaging facility (also at the University of Pittsburgh), a drug distribution center, 2 central laboratories, and 3 outside contractors. The Consortium is governed by a Steering Committee with help from 9 subcommittees and is overseen by an External Advisory Committee/Data Safety and Monitoring Board. Study data and bio-specimens are deposited in 3 NIDDK repositories. In Study A, the effect of study medication on structural progression at 2 levels of BP control is assessed using a 2x2 factorial design. Study B compares ACE-I/ARB combination therapy with ACE-I monotherapy on the time to a 50 percent reduction of baseline estimated GFR, ESRD or death. The CRHC Data Center currently coordinates the CRISP II cohort (Consortium of Radiologic Imaging Studies of PKD), and we will apply our expertise in PKD and data management and analysis to: 1) develop a Web-based data management system that incorporates data tracking, entry, quality control, safety monitoring, and report generation; 2) organize trial communications, support recruitment and retention at each site, and coordinate and monitor the transfer of data, images, and bio-specimens; and 3) plan and conduct statistical analyses to support the aims of each study. Co-locating the DCC for CRISP II and HALT-PKD will enhance the efficiency of data management, pooling, and analyses that could lead to new hypotheses and spin-off study designs. Following the seamless transition of the CRISP II DCC to Pittsburgh, we rapidly developed a Web-based data management and entry system and will apply our prior experience in moving an existing DCC for an ongoing multisite trial to minimize downtime for HALT-PKD. The CRHC Data Center has PhD-level statisticians with expertise needed for this effort, including genetics and longitudinal analyses of correlated data. Data Center personnel also bring expertise in customized form design, on-demand study progress reporting, and site staff training. We are dedicated to completing our work in a timely fashion and respecting the needs of clinical PIs and HALT team.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable] Approximately 470,000 Americans have end-stage renal disease and most are treated with hemodialysis. A vascular access is required for performing the hemodialysis procedure and can be provided with a native arteriovenous (AV) fistula, a synthetic AV graft; or a central venous catheter. The AV fistula is the preferred type of vascular access because thrombosis rates, infection rates, access-related expenditures, and total healthcare expenditures all are lower for patients with fistulas than for those with either synthetic AV grafts or central venous catheters. However, the advantages of fistulas are counterbalanced by the substantially higher proportion of fistulas than grafts that are never able to be used for dialysis because of failure to mature adequately to support effective hemodialysis. Maturation failure is the major barrier to increasing fistula prevalence, and, for many patients, leads to multiple surgical procedures or prolonged use of central venous catheters, the least desirable type of vascularaccess. Recent studies suggest that 20-50% of new fistulas fail to mature. This application is a response to an NIDDK RFA to establish a consortium for designing and performing an observational cohort study of patients with new fistulas. We are applying to be one of the Participating Clinical Centers of the Consortium. The overall objective of this application is to identify determinants of fistula maturation outcomes in order to enable early identification of failing fistulas, elucidate mechanisms underlying fistula maturation, and identify potential targets for maturation-enhancing interventions. Our application has five specific aims. These include 1) determining the utility of ultrasound as a method for early identification of fistulas that are failing to mature, 2) evaluating the impact of pre-existing vascular function on fistula maturation outcomes, 3) identifying surgical factors that are associated with fistula maturation outcomes, 4) creating evidence-based criteria for fistula maturation, and 5) characterizing the clinical consequences of fistula maturation failure. These aims assume an enrollment of 75-100 subjects over two years at our site for an overall study cohort of 600 subjects. Several of our aims include sub-studies that will be performed in a subset of the subjects to provide additional mechanistic information about the fistula maturation process. Our established research focus and expertise in hemodialysis vascular access, our success and leadership as a Clinical Center for the NIDDK Dialysis Access Consortium (DAC), the multidisciplinary expertise of the collaborators for this application, and the resources available at Boston University make us ideally suited to serve as a Participating Clinical Center for this NIDDK initiative.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable] The Hemodialysis Fistula Maturation Consortium (HFMC) will conduct a prospective multi-center observational cohort study investigating factors associated with the failure of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) to mature. The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will coordinate, administer, and support all HFMC research activities including all scientific and operational aspects of the Consortium. The DCC will: 1) assist in protocol development and analytical approaches for the protocol, and provide statistical leadership for study design; 2) develop data forms, instructions, and manuals of operations; 3) develop a data management and data collection system including an electronic communication system; 4) develop and maintain two web sites, one public and one for the research team; 5) establish, maintain and provide appropriate oversight to subcontracts for any central core laboratories as required; 6) work with the NIDDK Biosamples Repository and the clinical sites to coordinate procedures for coding, shipping, processing, receipt and storage of study samples to be maintained by the Repository; prepare the study data and coordinate with the NIDDK Data Repository for archiving; 7) develop procedures for quality control and training; 8) monitor the quality and quantity of data received from the clinical centers; 9) schedule, organize and perform site visits to clinical sites; 10) prepare periodic reports and analyses on recruitment, quality control, study adherence, patient safety and study results to the Steering Committee, the NIDDK and the Data, Safety and Monitoring Board; 11) support and coordinate manuscript publications and professional meeting presentations through data analysis, statistical collaboration and editorial support; 12) develop new statistical methodology as needed to properly analyze the data being collected; 13) schedule and arrange for all meetings and conference calls of established committees and boards; 14) provide regulatory guidance; and,15) provide overall scientific leadership. The goal of the HFMC is to identify pre-peri- and post-operative factors for AVF maturation and usability. Identification of risk factors for maturation failure and establishment of a surrogate for usability would facilitate the design of interventional trials targeting modifiable factors and help guide the clinical practice of whether and when to place AVF, and monitoring and implementing corrective actions for the AVF, thus improving hemodialysis patient lives.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable] A well functioning arteriovenous fistula is the preferred type of vascular access for chronic hemodialysis. In the recent DAC fistula studies we and others observed that fewer than 16% of surgically created fistulas failed due to thrombosis but more than 60% of fistulas failed to reach suitability for dialysis, confirming that impaired maturation is the main obstacle to success after fistula creation. This proposal will address fundamental gaps in knowledge about fistula maturation. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that a combination of anatomic and functional abnormalities of the arterial and venous circulations of the upper extremities predict AV fistula maturation failure in patients with stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease. We submit that studies of vascular structure and function can be used to predict fistula maturation. We further hypothesize that vascular calcification in the arm predisposes to fistula maturation failure by impairing vascular distensibility and endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In addition, we propose that augmented sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction is another factor that contributes to maturation failure of fistulas by preventing the large increases in blood flow necessary in a developing AV fistula. To test these hypotheses we will conduct a prospective observational study of fistula maturation in patients with chronic kidney disease. We will define the natural history of fistula maturation and related clinical and surgical events. We will perform a detailed preoperative evaluation of vessel anatomy, blood flow to the arm and vascular calcifications to identify preoperative predictors of fistula maturation. Finally, early after fistula creation we will evaluate fistula anatomy, blood flow and physical examination findings to develop early postoperative predictors of impaired fistula maturation. Knowledge obtained from the studies in this proposal will help to improve patient selection for AV fistula creation, identify key anatomic and functional predictors of maturation failure, and provide valid data for future intervention trials to promote fistula maturation. A well functioning vascular access is an absolute necessity to provide life-sustaining treatments for patients on hemodialysis AV fistulas are the best type of vascular access for dialysis, but unfortunately, most fistulas fail to develop adequately to sustain dialysis treatments. This proposal aims to identify predictors of fistula failure so that appropriate interventions to improve success can be implemented in the future.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

The objective of our proposal is to investigate the etiology, pathophysiology, and epidemiology of UCPPS in a multi-disciplinary manner. We have assembled a team of investigators from Washington University In St. Louis, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the University of Miami, and the University of Texas at Dallas Southwestern Medical School, that consists of researchers from several disciplines: anesthesiology, rheumatology, gastroenterology, neuroradiology, molecular microbiology, infectious disease, epidemiology, psychology, and urology. By bringing together these successful and productive investigators with strong record of participating in collaborative science from disciplines outside of urology, many of them new to UCPPS research, we hope to introduce new expertise, test new hypotheses, and provide new direction to UCPPS research. A total of 5 projects are proposed to achieve our objective. Projects 1 and 2 will investigate the epidemiology of IC/PBS and CP/CPPS, respectively. In PROJECT 1, Drs Hooton and Hultgren will evaluate the role of bacteriuria, viruria, and infectious agents as an underlying etiology for IC/PBS in a prospective cohort study with frequent biologic specimen collection and daily patient-reported symptom diary. In PROJECT 2, Drs Colditz, Sutcliffe and Andriole will investigate the biologic and behavioral risk factors for development of CP/CPPS and symptom exacerbation using case-control studies and longitudinal studies. Projects 3, 4, and 5 share a common goal to evaluate the role of central nervous system abnormality in IC/PBS. In PROJECT 3, Drs Gereau and Lai will study the molecular mechanisms of spinal cord pain sensitization using an animal model that mimics IC pain. In PROJECT 4, Drs Ness, Bradley and Deutsch will use quantitative sensory testing (QST) and innovative intracerebral blood-flow neuroimaging techniques (CASL-fMRI) to evaluate sensory processing in IC/PBS patients with and without associated fibromyalgia. In PROJECT 5, Drs Hong and North will investigate the relationship between IC/PBS and somatization disorder. Collectively, we are confident that these 5 projects will address key questions in UCPPS research, and deepen our understanding of chronic pain syndromes.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

       " '   DESCRIPTION, OVERALL (provided by applicant): This proposal responds to RFA of -DK-07-003, which requests applications for Discovery Centers to collaborate with other Discovery Centers in a Multi-Disciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network. In this application, the University of Washington (UW) seeks support for a Discovery Center to participate in efforts to unravel the enigma of what has been termed urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS) by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). This proposal was developed following the guidelines stipulated by the NIDDK for Program Project Grants and Cooperative Agreements. The aims of these Discovery Centers, in conjunction with the Tissue Analysis and Technology Core and the Data Coordination Core, are to conduct multi-disciplinary, multi-site, basic, translational, and clinical research in the field of UCPPS. The goals of the MAPP Research Network are to 1) identify UCPPS disease phenotypes;2) determine how UCPPS fit into the larger spectrum of related chronic pain syndromes (RCPS);3) conduct targeted epidemiological studies of UCPPS using relevant patient populations;and 4) use basic cellular, molecular, and biochemical techniques to examine the pathophysiology of UCPPS. More broadly, each site will need to collaborate closely with NIDDK staff and other Network Centers to complete multidisciplinary, multi-site, and highly interactive studies, and to obtain specimens for basic science studies. In addition, Discovery Centers will need the flexibility to accept and implement new and perhaps unconventional UCPPS definitions, and to both import and export study designs and methods pertinent to UCPPS.

The MAPP Research Network will utilize a multi-site and multi-disciplinary approach to provide new insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes, and establish a new and valuable biorepository resource for current and future research efforts. In response to the RFA, the TATC will interact with all research entities in the MAPP Network and provide expertise and resources in the areas of: 1) Biorepository Collection, Management and Distribution for all body fluid and tissue specimens generated by the MAPP Discovery Sites, and the generation of specialized assay platforms from these specimens such as protein and/or tissue arrays, DMA or RNA extractions as needed for Discovery Site efforts or the Ancillary Projects Program; 2) Histopathology and Tissue Morphometry including diagnostic interpretation, paraffin processing and microtomy, cryomicrotomy, laser capture microdissection, immunohistochemistry, and computer-assisted imaging/ image analysis; 3) Proteomics/ Metabolomics by providing a state-of-the-art centralized mass spectrometry facility to assist with proper collection and handling of specimens, consultative assistance for proteomic and/or metabolomics studies, and performance of a wide variety of assays, including two-dimensional gel- and chromatography-based proteome profiling, protein arrays, cytokine arrays, multiplexed ELISA, RT-PCR, infrared imaging, mass spectrometry and NMR-based targeted and non-targeted metabolite profiling, pharmacokinetic studies, oxidative stress assessment, and mass spectrometry analyses; and 4) Genomics/ Genotyping by providing consultative assistance and a state-of-the-art genomics facility to assist with advanced genotyping techniques. It is our underlying hypothesis that the quality, reliability and applicability of biological research on pelvic pain syndromes can only be guaranteed through the use of high quality non-biased patient specimens that have been handled, processed, analyzed and interpreted in a uniform manner.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The MAPP Research Network will be the largest research initiative of its kind for chronic pelvic pain syndrome, a common but understudied condition in men and women. The establishment of a Tissue Analysis and Technology Core Facility is crucial to the success of this research program.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

This University of Iowa MAPP grant proposal is intended to study this condition from a new perspective. The proposal is designed around the general hypothesis that patients with IC/PBS bladder symptoms and a co-morbid condition like fibromyalgia (FM) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have systemic basis for their symptoms and are fundamentally different from patients with IC/PBS bladder symptoms alone. We based our general hypothesis on the previous work of the investigators in this MAPP application which is detailed in subsequent sections. During the program project planning and design phase for the 5 projects proposed in this grant, all investigators worked from this general hypothesis. The proposed work is important because of its novel nature and the synergy and horizontal integration among the 5 proposed projects. The projects were planned to examine the heterogenous condition of IC/PBS. The cohorts of patients to be studied are similar across all clinical projects and include patients with IC/PBS symptoms in the bladder only, patients with IC/PBS bladder symptoms and a systemic co-morbid condition (FM, IBS), patients with only a co-morbid condition (FM.IBS) and healthy controls. The basic science projects reinforce and expand the scope of the clinical projects by utilizing biologic specimens collected in the clinical projects to add basic cellular, molecular and biochemical understanding of the UCPPS syndrome (IC/PBS). The Project proposals examine the UCPPS of IC/PBS from a multifaceted perspective. Subsequent data analysis of this Discovery Site project will describe the phenotype and risk factors of each group related to the HPA axis, stress response, neurophysiology, pain pattern, biologic and behavioral predisposing factors, basic immunology and biochemistry.

The faculty of the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center (CPFRC) are internationally known for translational research in fibromyalgia (FM) and related illnesses, including interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS). The Center has begun collaborating with a strong group of colleagues from the DM Urology Department. These investigators have expertise that spans the translational \"bench to community\" continuum of IC and chronic pelvic pain. All of our projects will pursue a unifying hypothesis that we feel has been supported in related pain conditions and may underlie IC/PBS: A subset of women with IC/PBS has a \"central\" problem in pain or sensory processing, as occurs in FM, rather than a disorder confined to the bladder. Project one extends the ongoing NIH-funded RICE study (a cross-sectional epidemiological study that queries individuals in the U.S. regarding their current symptoms). This study will 1) examine the natural history of IC/PBS in the general population, 2) show that IC/PBS patients in tertiary care clinical samples have higher rates of co-morbid conditions, including psychological co-morbidities, than IC/PBS patients in the population, and will also identify a population-based cohort of IC/PBS patients in the Michigan region that can be recruited for studies at our discovery site. Project two will perform experimental sensory testing and functional neuroimaging in women with IC/PBS, healthy controls, and FM patients. We hypothesize that IC/PBS patients are diffusely sensitive to pain and other sensory stimuli, similar to FM patients. Project three will further explore the precise reason(s) for the augmented pain and sensory processing seen in IC/PBS. A specific molecular probe will test whether a subset of IC/PBS patients has attenuated descending analgesic activity that is restored via administration of a selective noradrenergic/serotonergic reuptake inhibitor (NSRI), milnacipran. We hypothesize that we will show via experimental pain testing and functional neuroimaging that there is attenuated descending analgesic activity in some IC/PBS patients, and that improvements in these experimental parameters will be accompanied by improvement in pain and urinary urgency/frequency. We also hypothesize that certain genetic polymorphisms in COMT and beta-2 and-3 adrenoreceptors will predict the magnitude of the descending analgesic response, and response to a NSRI.

It is part of a larger group of chronic functional pain disorders, which also include such common disorders as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and fibromyalgia (FM). A common feature of these syndromes is that they are multifactorial and present clinically as a mosaic of biologic and psychologic phenotypes. Despite intense, largely target organ-based drug development efforts, existing treatments are unsatisfactory. The current proposal, co-directed by experienced, senior investigators from gastroenterology and urology builds on this interdisciplinary view and aims to characterize the interactions of biological and environmental vulnerability factors to shape behavioral and neurobiological endophenotypes, and ultimately clinical phenotypes in IC/PBS. The 3 Projects of the proposal address the following 3 areas: Project 1 is a targeted epidemiological project studying the impact of genetic markers, early life experiences and adult stress on IC/PBS symptoms and comorbid pain syndromes. Project 2 is a clinical/translational study in a small cohort of IC/PBS patients (and in a rodent model of early life and chronic stress) which aims at characterizing several neurobiological and behavioral endophenotypes, and identifying their relationship to gene polymorphisms. Project 3 is a basic science study in IC/PBS patients and in the same rodent stress model which aims at studying cellular and molecular consequences of altered noradrenergic/SNS signaling on the urothelium and spinal glial cells. These projects involve a wide range of epidemiological, psychophysiological, neurobiological and molecular techniques, performed by an interdisciplinary group of investigators ranging from Urology, Gastroenterology, Epidemiology and Neuroscience, who have access to an established infrastructure to study neurovisceral interactions, and who have extensive previous experience in the study of functional pain syndromes, including IBS and IC/PBS. The projects closely interact with each other, and project investigators have been interacting with a large group of researchers and affiliated institutions. By deconstructing the complex, symptom-based syndrome of IC/PBS into distinct, neurobiological and behavioral endophenotypes, we anticipate the identification of more rationale drug development targets, and ultimately the development of more effective therapies.

The projects closely interact with each other, and project investigators have been interacting with a large group of researchers and affiliated institutions. By deconstructing the complex, symptom-based syndrome of IC/PBS into distinct, neurobiological and behavioral endophenotypes, we anticipate the identification of more rationale drug development targets, and ultimately the development of more effective therapies.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although significant progress has been made recently in hepatitis B (HBV) therapy, the current knowledge in the management of HBV infection is limited because treatment trials have utilized one to two years of therapy at most, whereas most patients require treatment of much longer duration for optimal long term outcome.  [unreadable] Our first project addresses optimal long term management of patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B. Thus, in Project 1, we propose a trial in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis to evaluate the ability of pegylated interferon in combination with tenofovir (TDF) to alter the natural history, by achieving the following aims: (Project 1a) to compare the long term efficacy and safety of combination of pegylated interferon and TDF versus TDF alone and (Project 1 b) to identify predictors of response to the combination therapy and measure the long term benefit of antiviral therapy.  [unreadable] In our second project, we will investigate means to optimize the long term outcome in patients with HBV infection including HCC and end stage liver disease. The majority of these patients will be HBeAg-negative. These patients are in a later phase of chronic HBV infection and thus tend to be older and to have more fibrosis, which predispose them to a higher risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, in Project 2, we propose observational studies to dissect the effect of host (e.g., age, gender, race, stage of liver disease) and virologic (genotype, sequential HBV DMA levels) characteristics on the risk of HCC, by conducting studies with following aims: (Project 2a) to compare the age- and gender-specific incidence of HCC between patients of Asian and African origin and (Project 2b) to measure the effect of baseline patient characteristics and serial HBV DMA and ALT levels to develop a score estimating the risk of HCC and assess the impact of antiviral therapy on the risk of developing end stage liver disease and HCC.  [unreadable] While the most active liver disease tends to be seen in young, HBeAg-positive hepatitis patients, the majority of our clinic patients are HBeAg-negative with little evidence of active liver disease. Our project addresses important questions in both of these populations.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decrease in incidence of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has not been translated into a corresponding decrease in prevalence of chronic infection. Currently, immigration from endemic countries accounts for roughly 90% of all new cases of chronic HBV infection in the US. The diversity of race/ethnicity of the US population and the presence of many HBV genotypes presents an opportunity to study host-virus relationships and their association with clinical outcomes. Currently, there are 6 approved treatments for hepatitis B, but these treatments do not eradicate the virus. Most patients require long (or indefinite) durations of treatment to maintain virus suppression, leading to problems with antiviral resistance and affordability. The key questions regarding hepatitis B treatment are: when to start, which antiviral agent(s) should be used, when to stop, and what to do in patients with antiviral resistance? This Clinical Center application comprises 2 sites: University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Hawaii Medical Center East/University of Hawaii in Honolulu. Dr. Lok is an international authority on hepatitis B and has a long record of success in hepatitis B research, she will be the PI. Dr. Tsai has a long standing clinical and research interest in hepatitis B and has extensive experience in community outreach programs, he will be the co-l. The goals of this Clinical Center application are to further our understanding of the natural history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the mechanisms of spontaneous and treatment related virus clearance, the epidemiological and clinical impact of antiviral drug-resistant HBV mutations, and to determine the optimal treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis B. To achieve this goal, we will work in close collaboration with the other Clinical Centers, the Data Coordinating Center, the Immunology Center, the Virology Center, and the NIDDK Project Office; and will comply with the decisions of the HBV Clinical Research Network (CRN) Steering Committee and the policies of all HBV CRN committees. A database will be established to determine the spectrum of chronic HBV infection in the US, factors associated with disease progression, and incidence of antiviral drug resistance in clinical practice. A randomized trial comparing de novo combination of entecavir + tenofovir vs. entecavir vs. tenofovir in nucleoside na[unreadable]ve HBeAg+ and HBeAg- patients with compensated liver disease with genotypic resistance as the primary endpoint is proposed. Clinical trials on other important topics such as treatment of patients in the immune tolerance phase and optimal management of patients with antiviral-resistant HBV are also discussed.

The Network will include up to 10 collaborating Clinical Centers, a Virology Center, an Immunology Center, a NIDDK Project Scientist, and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). This Network will work cooperatively to create a database of all patients with hepatitis B followed at the Clinical Centers with special focus on newly diagnosed cases. The Network will also include a randomized, controlled trial of long-term mono-versus combination therapy for chronic hepatitis B. Possibly 2-4 clinical trials, clinical or epidemiologic investigations will be conducted by the Network.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] As the DCC, we will work with the HB-CRN members to support all aspects of study design, study conduct, and data analysis for the database and clinical trials. The DCC will develop a distributed data entry system and maintain a secure, central database of clinical, laboratory, and other relevant information from the Clinical, Virology, and Immunology Centers. The DCC will identify and contract with other central facilities (e.g., laboratory, pathology) as needed and coordinate with the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repositories. The DCC will develop safety and efficacy analysis plans and prepare materials for presentations at HB-CRN meetings, scientific conferences, and for publications and regulatory bodies. The DCC will coordinate all activities of the Network, including meetings and conference calls for the Steering Committee, subcommittees, and presentations to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board(s). Finally, we will share data collected for the HB-CRN, participate in translation activities with the wider scientific, clinical, and general community and archive all data, study intervention materials, and coordinate archiving all specimens at the end of the study.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic, enveloped, partially double-stranded DMA virus that causes acute and chronic hepatitis with progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite an effective vaccine, over 350 million people throughout the world are chronically infected with HBV and may be at risk for progressive liver disease without optimal antiviral therapy. While HBV clearance is associated with robust and broad virus-specific IFN(+ type 1 effector T cell responses, viremia persists with impaired virus-specific effector T cells that cannot clear viremia but may nonetheless contribute to disease pathogenesis. Based on published literature and our own preliminary data implicating immune regulatory (FoxP3+ Tregs, IL-10) and costimulatory (PD-1) pathways in chronic viral infections including HBV, we hypothesize that the outcome of HBV infection and therapy is defined by the balance between antiviral effector and regulatory T-cell responses that are further shaped by innate signals. We also propose that targeted inhibition of negative immune regulatory pathways may reverse the antiviral effector dysfunction and unmask the underlying effector capacity for prolonged virus control. To this end, we will examine the following 3 specific aims to determine if: 1) HBV persists with distinct effector and regulatory T-cell responses that can predict clinical and therapeutic outcomes; 2) Virus suppression during HBV therapy will enhance antiviral effector T-cell function and reduce inhibitory immune regulatory factors; 3) Modulation in adaptive immune responses with therapeutic HBV suppression is defined by innate immune response. The proposed studies will provide insights to the mechanisms of immune dysfunction in HBV persistence, define potential early immunological markers to prognosticate therapeutic outcome and to define future immune-based strategies to enhance long term therapeutic outcome.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The optimal treatment for chronic hepatitis B remains controversial. Published guidelines from several sources suggest initiating antiviral therapy, in general, when serum ALT activity is abnormal and when significant liver disease is present. These recommendations have largely been developed by balancing the likelihood of response as measured in short-term studies against the likelihood of developing viral resistance during extended therapy. However, these guidelines have never been prospectively evaluated to determine whether they truly represent the best strategy for selecting candidates for treatment. Furthermore, recent epidemiologic data indicate that the presence of high level HBV viremia itself is an important risk factor for subsequent cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting that rigid adherence to treatment guidelines may disadvantage many patients for whom long-term viral suppression may be beneficial. The current availability of multiple potent antiviral agents with good safety profiles and a seemingly low risk of resistance provide an opportunity to optimize strategies to treat chronic hepatitis B.  [unreadable] This proposal will focus on the design of 1) a research database and specimen repository and 2) a collaborative multicenter trial to corroborate current treatment guidelines while comparing the long-term efficacy and safety of monotherapy vs. combination therapy. The study design will further refine the identification and management of hepatitis B viral resistance during extended therapy, and provide important information regarding the long-term outcomes associated with treatment. Our proposal to participate as a Clinical Center for this cooperative study will emphasize the experience, unique attributes, and patient population of the Liver Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in collaboration with Duke University, and Carolinas Medical Center, which will ensure successful completion of these studies as a member of the Hepatitis B Clinical Research network.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have established the Midwest Hepatitis B Consortium, comprising investigators from several institutions with considerable expertise in hepatitis B, to act as a clinical center for the Hepatitis B Network. This consortium maximizes our access to patients with HBV infection for enrollment in Network studies. The consortium allows is to bring unique strengths to bear including having two pediatric hepatologists to develop and conduct studies in children with hepatitis B and a nationally recognized liver pathologist (Elizabeth Brunt M.D.) with the knowledge, equipment and expertise to scan and digitize liver biopsy slides from all subjects enrolled in Network studies. Specific aim 1 is to establish a database of HBsAg-positive subjects from all consortium sites. One aim of the database is to determine the proportion of patients with chronic HBV infection who initially meet criteria for antiviral therapy. Those who are not initially treated will be followed at 6 month intervals over the next 5 years to determine the proportion who reactivate and become eligible for treatment. The second specific aim is to conduct a randomized double-blind controlled trial of entecavir vs, tenofovir vs. the combination of these two agents for 4 yrs, with 1 yr of follow up with the primary endpoint being the proportion of patients at year 5 (1 year follow up after stopping therapy) in whom HBV DNA is undetectable in serum (PCR negative). The third specific aim is to conduct a series of ancillary studies aimed at answering key questions about chronic hepatitis B. We propose ancillary studies to be considered by the Network steering committee including a pilot, exploratory study of entecavir in children, aimed at determining the pharmacokinetics and optimal dosing because of the limited treatment options available to children with hepatitis B. We propose pilot, exploratory studies of treatment of under-studied groups including patients in the immune tolerant and inactive carrier phases of chronic hepatitis B. We propose virology studies to be carried out in collaboration with the Virology Center, including full length cloning of HBV isolates from each subject to study viral variables contributing to resistance and genetic covariance network analysis, as we have successfully done in hepatitis C. Finally, we propose studies on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) using the Hepatitis B Quality of Life instrument, version 1.0, HBQOL v1.0 developed and validated by Dr Fasiha Kanwal, consortium P.I. at the St. Louis VAMC.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B viral infection remains an important cause of chronic liver disease and liver cancer, affecting approximately 2 million Americans and more than 350 million people worldwide. Despite vaccine discovery, the burden of chronic, often lifelong hepatitis B infection remains high in this country and even more so abroad. Understanding its natural history and pathogenesis has improved but there are still many aspects of this complex infection that escape our understanding. For example, the immune system plays an important role both in causing liver damage and in its eradicating infection, but efforts thus far to heighten immune responses to improve viral clearance have failed. Nucleoside analogues are now available that are capable of lowering the viral burden, with resultant improvement in inflammation in the liver, but mutations arise frequently and the role of drugs in the management of patients with various phases of hepatitis B remains controversial. In addition, many patients with serious underlying liver disease are unaware of their disease or the clear benefits of treatment that accrue in most circumstances. New efforts at patient and physician education will be needed to reach the many patients who have infection and could benefit from care. Approximately 50% of patients with chronic hepatitis B in the US are of Asian ethnicity and many of these patients have disease that warrants treatment despite ALT values that fall within the standard reference range-treatment of this group is probably indicated but has not been tried in any controlled trial to date. The present RFA is intended to meet these challenges. Our proposal reviews current knowledge about hepatitis B, provides data on the burden of hepatitis B in the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex, and the strengths and experience of the investigators for future recruiting efforts for the proposed studies. We also provide the outline of a specific trial designs for a detailed database and to answer the concern raised, that is, to what extent do actively viremic Asian Americans with high normal aminotransferase levels benefit from a prolonged course of treatment with a potent, low resistance nucleoside analog.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) using oral antiviral agents has been shown to suppress viral replication. There are guidelines on when to start antiviral therapy but none on when to stop therapy once initiated. This study hinges on the argument that it is safe and desirable to endeavor to attain a durable off-treatment response (DOTR) to therapy in hepatitis B infected individuals with advanced liver fibrosis who have had complete and long-term viral suppression. Preliminary data demonstrate that a DOTR can be achieved and that it is rare to have adverse clinical outcomes after stopping therapy even in compensated cirrhotics if patients are closely monitored. This study is a formal test of the safety of structured treatment interruption (STI). Our plan is to evaluate Tenofovir (TDF) and Truvada in a multi-centre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial of treatment-na[unreadable]ve stable, well-compensated cirrhotics with HBV DNA =10 X 4 copies/mL. Specific aims are: 1) to test the safety and cost-effectiveness of an STI after 2 years vs 4 years duration of continuous and complete viral suppression (HBV DNA <70 copies/mL); 2) to test whether 4 years is superior to 2 years duration of continuous and complete suppression; 3) to identify if there are marked differences between TDF and Truvada; and 4) to determine if quantitative HBsAg levels, immune markers, or intrahepatic cccDNA levels can predict the likelihood of achieving a DOTR. In addition, we propose a clinical database structure which can facilitate clinical management while providing information on the epidemiology of CHB and the underlying socioeconomic, cultural, and clinical factors that contribute to outcomes in CHB. Electronic health records will feed serial clinical and laboratory data into the database. Clinical prompts will facilitate the need for urgent action with therapeutic interventions and deliver patient reminders for timely follow-up. The database will be used to examine how viral and host factors influence the development of liver-related complications in patients with advanced CHB. Results from this study could produce stopping rules for management guidelines, which would constitute a major advancement in the field.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A high HBV viral load has been implicated in both disease progression and resistance to antiviral therapy in Asian adults; however this role has not been clarified in other populations such as children and non-Asian adults (both of which typify our Baltimore population of HBV-infected individuals.) Furthermore, viral determinants of HBV viral replication rates have not been fully elucidated in any population. Our group has recently reported two findings which could shed new light on these determinants: 1) Methylation of HBV DNA occurs in non-integrated as well as integrated HBV and may down regulate viral replication and 2) The novel double mutant HBV 1762T/1764A, with overlapping sequences for the HBV core promoter and the HBV S gene, increases viral replication in Asian adults. This mutant has greater sensitivity and specificity for both diagnosing and predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Asian adults compared to other HCC biomarkers. We propose to use these novel findings in both a database and a clinical trial. The database will contain all HBV-infected individuals cared for in the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions which we estimate will contain ~ 100 children and adolescents and ~650 adults of whom - 50% are African American, 300 are HBV/HIV co-infected; 150 are HBV/HIV/HCV tri-infected, and 50 have HCC. For the database protocol we will analyze sera for both HBV DNA methylation and the double mutant to test two hypotheses: 1) In patients with methylated serum HBV DNA, HBV DNA viral load will be lower compared to patients with non-methylated serum HBV DNA and 2) In patients with HBV HCC, HBV viral loads will be higher, HBV DNA methylation rates lower, and the double mutant frequency increased compared to age and sex-matched HBV-infected controls. The clinical trial will be a sequential randomized controlled trial in immunotolerant subjects 5 - 21 years (HBsAg+,HBeAG+, HBV DNA >10(4)cpm), to determine if lowering the HBV viral load by a nucleoside analogue(NA) followed by an immunomodulator will improve response compared to (NA) alone. Group 1 will receive entecavir(ETV) for 8 weeks followed by pegylated interferon + ETV for 40 weeks; Group 2 will receive ETV alone. Response will be defined by HBeAg loss/ HBV DNA < 200 cpm at 48 weeks.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a major public health problem affecting up to 400 million people globally. Complications of CHB including liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) result in 1.2 million deaths per year, making CHB the 10th leading cause of mortality worldwide. The natural history of CHB is complex and variable. Many viral and host factors have been implicated in disease progression and hepatocarcinogenesis but most of these conclusions have been based on retrospective analyses with limited longitudinal data. Currently, six agents are FDA-approved for the treatment of CHB. Each of these agents, given as monotherapy, has been shown to produce virological, biochemical and histological benefits for both HBeAg positive and negative CHB. However, each are associated with limitations. The significant side-effect profile of interferon, for example, limits its long-term use. The approved oral agents are tolerable even with prolonged use but drug resistance has been identified with each of them. To date, the limited data on combination therapy with nucleoside analogue and pegylated interferon (PEGIFN) or two nucleos(t)ide analogues given for one year does not show their superiority in durability of response compared to monotherapy. However, there have been no studies to address the efficacy of prolonged combination therapy. In this proposal, by working collaboratively with the 10 clinical centers, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC), Virology Center, and Immunology Center within the NIH HBV network, we plan to (1)construct a prospective, comprehensive patient database that includes demographic and clinical features, viral factors, liver histology and radiological findings that will enable us to examine the natural history of hepatitis B and to identify predictors of disease progression and recovery using both cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical data; and (2) design a 3-year, phase III, prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label study to compare the efficacy and safety of entecavir (ETV) versus ETV and tenofovir (TDF) versus ETV and PEGIFN-alpha-2a for treatment naive patients with HBeAg positive and negative CHB. Patients randomized to the third arm will receive a 2-year course of PEGIFN and a 3-year course of ETV. ETV and TDF are structurally distinct, potent antiviral agents that do not have cross-resistance. We hypothesize that(1) both combination therapy arms will have higher rates of HBV DNA suppression and lower rates of resistance compared to ETV monotherapy; and (2) the combination of PEGIFN with ETV will produce the highest rates of both HBeAg and HBsAg seroconversion and, hence, durability of response. Collectively, the database and trial will yield rich data regarding natural history and optimal therapy for CHB.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To enroll patients from our racially diverse database into various natural history and treatment trials developed by the HBCRN. Our current understanding of the natural history of chronic HBV and the response of this disease to treatment has been dominated by studies conducted in Asian and to a lesser extent Caucasian populations. This may not reflect the natural history of the disease in African Americans. There is a pacuity of data regarding the natural history of chronic HBV and its response to treatment in African Americans. Addressing this gap in our knowledge is important because African Americans represent the second most common racial/ethnic group with chronic HBV infection in the USA. Including Clinical Care Centers with large African American populations in the HBCRN will be critical to understanding the natural history of chronic HBV and its response to treatment in this minority population. African Americans account for approximately 25% of patients with chronic HBV at our Clinical Care Center whereas Asians accounts for less than half of our patients. This unique population will allow the HBCRN to test the following hypotheses:  [unreadable] Hypothesis 1: The serologic and virologic spectrum of chronic HBV in African Americans is markedly different than observed in Asians who reside in the USA.  [unreadable] Hypothesis 2: Insulin resistence and other features of the metabolic syndrome, which are common in African Americans are associated with more severe liver injury and more rapid fibrosis progression in patients with chronic HBV.  [unreadable] Hypothesis 3: African Americans with E-antigen (+) chronic HBV have a significantly lower seroconversion rate following treatment with peginterferon compared to non-African Americans.

Asian Americans have the highest prevalence of chronic HBV, approximately 10% to 15%, followed by other groups including men who have sex with men, injection drug users, and hemodialysis patients (3% to 5% each). Risk factors for liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HBV patients remain undefined, though recent data support virological markers (HBV DMA quantitation) as important. Many questions still remain regarding true factors predictive of disease progression (Significance of intrahepatic cccDNA?) and optimal antiviral treatment strategies defining duration of therapy while minimizing resistance. The objectives and aims of this 7-year study are: 1) to design a database to document HBV natural history, help identify risk factors for disease progression, and establish a well-characterized repository of serum samples and liver tissue for ongoing and future studies; 2) to design a long-term clinical trial to study the resistance profile, efficacy, durability of response, and tolerability of different combinations of nucleos(t)ide analog drugs; and 3) to measure intrahepatic cccDNA decline on the nucleos(t)ide drug combinations. For the database protocol, eAg (+) and eAg (-) chronic HBV patients will be prospectively enrolled into a long-term observational database. Patients will continue to be followed by the investigators per standard-of-care and have demographic data, clinical data, serum/tissue samples, and outcomes data collected at regular time points over the study duration. Antiviral treatment is at the discretion of the individual investigator. The resulting large repository of data and specimen samples will serve as an important resource for future studies. For the clinical trial study, eAg (+) and eAg (-) chronic HBV patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either tenofovir monotherapy, entecavir monotherapy, or tenofovir + entecavir combination therapy for 240 weeks, then observed for relapse. Analyses of phenotypic/genotypic resistance development, rates of eAg seroconversion, HBV DNA undetectability, relapse after therapy, and tolerability will allow comparison of these endpoints between the three treatment strategies.   [unreadable] End-of-treatment (Week 240) liver biopsies will allow determination of intrahepatic cccDNA decline for the three treatment strategies when compared to baseline liver biopsies. Information gained from this study will help determine the optimal treatment to prevent resistance + the optimal duration of therapy to achieve durable responses.

With the availability of effective and well-tolerated HBV treatments, reductions in liver-related deaths are achievable, but unanswered questions regarding treatment include whether the current target groups for treatment should be expanded, if combinations of drugs are superior to single drug therapy, and what treatment endpoints should be used. In conjunction with the other HBV Clinical Trial Network investigators, the San Francisco HBV Consortium, a collaborative group of San Francisco investigators at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, California Pacific Medical Center and UCSF/San Francisco General Hospital with access to >6000 persons with chronic HBV infection, will address key issues in the natural history, pathogenesis and treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). With other HBV CRN investigators, we will establish an informational database of ~3000 persons with CHB for cross-sectional and cohort studies linked with a serum and tissue repository for clinical/translational studies. Our study aims for the database focus on (i) immune-tolerant CHB and the viral, genetic and host predictors of \"lost tolerance\"; and (iii) the risk of perinatal transmission in HBsAg-positive women. Each of these special populations is a potential target group for therapeutic studies within the Network. Additionally, we will also execute 2 clinical trials, with the primary goal of comparing combination versus monotherapy as first-line therapy for HBeAg-positive CHB and HBeAg-negative CHB. Combination therapy may offer greater antiviral potency and lower risk of drug resistance, but has added cost and may lower adherence. A clinical adaptive design is used. For HBeAg-negative CHB, we will compare entecavir (ETV) plus tenofovir (TDV) to tenofovir (TDV) and entecavir (ETV) monotherapies for a prolonged but finite treatment period of 48 months. For HBeAg-positive CHB, we will compare TDV monotherapy for48 months versus sequential TDV (for 3 month lead-in)/peginterferon (peg-IFN) alfa 2a for 6months/TDV for 39 months versus combination TDV plus ETV for 48 months. Patients with primary non-response or suboptimal virologic response at 6 and 24 months respectively, will be discontinued from treatment. HBeAg-positive CHB patients achieving HBeAg seroconversion will undergo randomized to 6 versus 24 months of consolidation TDV therapy. Host, genetic (including transporter polymorphisms), and virologic (HBsAg quantitation, cccDNA) will be examined as predictors of response/non-response.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

To date, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has succeeded in maintaining a prospective registry of well-defined cases with DILI to further research in this area. The long term-goal is to understand the genetic influence on mechanisms and clinical outcomes of DILI. Critical to the success for improved understanding of pathogenesis, the objective of this application is to further expand the registry by including additional patients with DILI from geographic areas not currently within the Network. In response to RFA-DK-07-712 (Continuation and Expansion of the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network), the Central Hypothesis of this application is to effectively contribute well-defined cases of DILI and propose novel mechanistic studies examining phenotype-genotype associations. The proposed research is relevant to that part of the NIH mission which pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burden of disease. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will focus on the identification and enrollment of cases with bona fide DILI and matched controls within a diverse racial and ethnic geographic population of 7 million individuals. Based on recent clinical experience with DILI, this consortium anticipates the enrollment of 250 cases affected by DILI and 750 matched controls with appropriate biospecimen collections over a 5 year period. Specific Aim 2 outlines a series of proposed experiments to determine whether differential activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) from endoplasmic reticulum stress occurs in the pathogenesis of idiosyncratic DILI. The proposed work is innovative based on the coupling of advanced bioinformatics technology, extensive clinical experience, and recognized expertise in liver cell injury and genetic epidemiology.

Unexpected DILI has hampered drug development for a multitude of effective drugs. Many agents have been approved or nearly approved but failed to gain widespread acceptance because of severe and sometimes fatal DILI. The small size of pre-approval trials means that infrequent events will not be captured. Thus, aggressive, robust, and measured approaches to post-marketing surveillance for adverse events due to drugs and their characterization is vital to the health of all Americans. The Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has made a strong start in laying the groundwork in its first 5 years, having put in place systems that can be used more widely in the future. Thus, an opportunity exists to enhance capture of additional cases of post-marketing DILI so as to improve our understanding of its causes and. potentially, its treatment. UT Southwestern is ideally suited to become a DILIN site for the following reasons: 1) the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex constitutes a widely diverse urban/suburban population of over 6.5 million people. 2) the investigators have specific and strong experience in DILI and clinical trials development, Our specific proposals include: 1) An advisory board of clinicians in the region to refer cases. We will consult them frequently, provide a 1-800 number for their calls and visit sites for in service updates and discussion of drugs of importance in causing DILI. 2) We will utilize the experience of the investigators in the Acute Liver Failure Study to expand and encourage further ancillary studies utilizing DILI biomaterials. Specific substudies should be possible with the large Hispanic population currently under study at our institution. 3) We propose a therapeutic trial using N-acetylcysteine for DILI cases that meet criteria for severe injury approximating Hy Zimmerman's law, that is, an acute illness with attendant jaundice.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN), funded by the National Institutes of Health in 2002, represents a critical strategy to mitigate the adverse consequences of DILI. Already, this extensive network of centers around the U.S. has cultivated an impressive repertoire of case-based clinical information and samples which will broaden our understanding of DILI. Initial work centered around retrospective data collection on DILI attributable to four drugs; amoxicillin/clavulanate, valproic acid, phenytoin, and isoniazid. Subsequent work, which is ongoing, involves the prospective accrual of incident cases of DILI from any drug or complementary and alternative medication. The purpose of this grant application is to contribute to the expansion of the DILIN through the participation of a large Philadelphia-based consortium; the Jefferson and University of Pennsylvania Health Systems represent the largest and second largest health care systems in the region, respectively. They draw adult and pediatric patients with hepatic disease from the region comprising Eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, Southern and Central New Jersey, and Northern Maryland. Hepatology leaders from these health care systems have agreed to collaborate as a single clinical center for his grant. In addition, the Geisinger Health System will participate as a subsite of Jefferson; this component will extend the consortium's reach to include a large part of central Pennsylvania. The consortium will bring to DILIN a large ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population of patients. The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: 1) To identify bona fide adult and pediatric cases of DILI within the region comprising Eastern and Central Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and Southern and Central New Jersey; 2) To validate the accuracy of disease attribution, in conjunction with other members of DILIN; 3) To support a national network of centers devoted to the advancement of pharmacogenetic and pharmacoepidemiological study of DILI, by providing clinical information and samples; and 4) To participate in the development and maintenance of a website for use as an educational resource on DILI.

       " 'Latino women are disproportionately at risk for unintended pregnancies. The objective of the proposed research is to increase understanding of unintended pregnancy among rural Latinos by examining determinants of contraceptive use,sexual risk behavior and HIV/STI prevention among young adult Latinos in rural settings. In this grant application, we request support for 4 years to  conduct two studies. In Study 1, we will conduct a total of 8-12 key informant interviews and 48-60 in- depth interviews with Latino women and men, as well as 3-6 key informant interviews and 6-8 focus groups with health care providers. The specific aims of Study 1 are to a) explore what young Latino women and men do to prevent unintended pregnancy; b) identify the personal characteristics, method characteristics, partner and relationship factors, and contextual factors that facilitate or impede the acquisition and use of contraceptives; c) explore the factors that are most likely to influence consistent  use of effective contraceptives; d) explore what young Latino women and men do to protect themselves from HIV and STIs; e) identify factors that facilitate or impede the acquisition and use of HIV/STI prevention methods; and f) characterize the influence of gender roles, male involvement, and power  differentials in sexual behavior and decision-making. Study 2 will build on the formative research and will include in-person, structured interviews with young (aged 18-25 years) Latinos (250 men, 250 women). The specific aims of Study 2 are to a) determine which factors - including personal characteristics, method characteristics, relationship/partner factors, and contextual factors - are most strongly associated with acquisition and use of contraceptives; b) determine which factors are most  strongly associated with consistent use of effective contraceptives; and c) determine which factors are most strongly associated with sexual risk and protective behavior. Findings will have important  implications for the development of public health programs and interventions that will ultimately lead to  the reduction of unintended pregnancy among young Latinos by improving contraceptive use, reducing  sexual risk taking, and improving the delivery of reproductive health services.',\n",
       " 'More than 800,000 teenagers become pregnant each year. Youthdevelopment programs, which are based on the belief that assets can insulate youthfrom engaging in harmful behaviors, are one promising approach to preventing teen pregnancy. However, to date there is little hard scientific evidence to suggest that youth assets are causally related to a reduction in teen sexual and related risk behaviors. The Youth Asset Study (YAS), a 3-year project funded by the CDC, is currently underwayto test the asset/teen sexual behavior causal relationship. The current proposalis to requestfunding to extend the YAS so that waves 4 to 6data can be collected and analyzed. The YAS is the first study to specifically and comprehensively investigate, using a developmental age group approachand a longitudinal study design, the relationships amongyouth assets and community factors and the strength of their relationships to youth sexual behavior, teen pregnancy, and related risk behaviors (e.g., alcohol and drug use). Currrently, we are tracking a cohort of youth (baseline ages 12 to 17)and their parents (N=1,000 youth/parent pairs) in a 3-year longitudinal study. Using in-home, in-person interview methods, the study team collected wave 1 data from 1,000 youth/parent pairs and wave 2 data from more than 100youth/parent pairs (to date). The retention rate is 94%. Wave 3 data will be collected in 2005 and 2006. This proposal encompassescollecting and analyzing data from waves 4 to 6 from the same youth/parent pairs. Byfollowing these youth through their teenage years and into early adulthood, we will investigate the role of assetsand community factors in influencing the health behavior and outcomes of youth as they transition into older teenand young adulthood. The YAS goals directly contribute to several Healthy People 2010 objectivesincluding objectives9-7 (i.e., Reduce pregnancies among adolescent females) and 25-11 (i.e., Increase the proportion of adolescents whoabstain from sexual intercourse or who use condoms if currently sexually active). The YAS is a scientifically rigorous evaluation of hypothesized relationships among community factors, assets and youth risk behaviors, which is of critical interest to the CDC, state and local health departments,and other organizations working in adolescent health.',\n",
       " 'Lack of progress in lowering rates of preterm delivery (PTD) in the U.S. has stimulated investigations into potential explanatory factors that are outside the current realm of prenatal care. These include factors at the micro\\' level, such as genes, and factors that are \\'upstream\\' such as acute/chronic stress and social class gradient which has consistently been shown to be related to PTD. There are a growing number of studies focusing on immune system-related genes and PTD because of strong evidence that some pathways to PTD have an infection and/or inflammation component. However, most of these studies have lacked information on other relevant biomarkers (e.g.cytokines, bacterial vaginosis), underlying pathologic processes (e.g. chorioamnionitis, placental infarcts, incomplete conversion of spiral arteries), and upstream factors(e.g. maternal stress), making it difficult to contextualize gene polymorphism-PTD findings.  The proposed study builds on the NIH funded, multi-ethnic, community-based Pregnancy Outcomes and Community Health (POUCH) Study of women enrolled in mid-pregnancy from 52 clinics in 5 Michigan communities. The POUCH study has data on prenatal maternal social conditions, health behaviors, psychological well-being, medical complications, histopathologic abnormalities of placenta/fetal membranes, vascular-related DNA polymorphisms, and mid-pregnancy biomarkers (e.g. maternal cortisol, plasma CRH, serum and vaginal fluid cytokines). In this CDC-funded \"add on\" to the POUCH study we have expanded our research team to include preeminent researchers in the area of PTD-related gene polymorphisms. We have selected nine immune system-related gene polymorphisms (TLR-4, CD14, MBL. IL-lra, TNFR2, MMP-9, Fas, TNFa and IL-1/3) that will be evaluated in 1,363 POUCH case-cohort mothers (311 preterm; 1,052 term), and 818 case-cohort offspring. Gene polymorphisms, as main effects and as modifiers of other relevant risk factors (e.g. bacterial vaginosis, stress), will be assessed in relation to PTD overall and PTD-subtypes (e.g., < 35 weeks\\' gestation, spontaneous labor intact membranes, PROM, histopathologic evidence of chorioamnionitis). This study of gene polymorphisms, situated within the rich database of the POUCH study, offers : 1) a chance to learn more about underlying processes leading to PTD that may involve maternal and/or fetal gene polymorphisms and gene-environment interactions: and 2) a chance to determine if maternal gene polymorphisms are useful, along with other biomarkers, as predictive factors that could guide selective enrollment into clinical trials with interventions targeted at specific underlying processes.',\n",
       " 'The primary aim of the present research is to examine factors associated with sexual risk taking in Latino youth. The project seeks to examine social, familial, and cultural forces that impact adolescent sexual decision making in samples of diverse (Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Dominican) Latino populations. The focus will be on Latino adolescents transitioning from middle school to high school and who reside in the South Bronx, New York City. The aims are (1) to examine the role of two core Latino cultural constructs, \"familismo\" and \"machismo/marianismo\" in the formation of adolescent romantic relationships and the engagement in sexual risk activity, (2) to examine the relationship between parental embracement of familismo and machismo/marianismo and the extent to which their children embrace these concepts, (3) to elucidate the developmental dynamics of the above as adolescents transition from middle school to high school, (4) to examine Latino adolescent and parental conceptions of preferred partners and activities that are appropriate for \"couples\" in a healthy relationship and to explore the implications of these for sexual risk taking, and (5) to examine how acculturation related stress impacts the above and to test the generalizability of the above across different Latino subgroups. The proposed project has a 2X3X5 factorial design. The first factor is gender (male versus female), the second factor is Latino ethnicity (Dominican versus Mexican versus Puerto Rican) and the third factor (a repeated measure factor) is time of assessment. We will interview both adolescents and their mothers on five separate assessment occasions. The final sample size will be approximately 125 mother-adolescent dyands per cell representing a total of 750 dyads in total.',\n",
       " 'Preterm birth (PTB) remains a major public health problem, complicating >10% of all deliveries, and its associated perinatal morbidity and mortality represents 30% of the total. The greatest single risk factor for PTB is a prior PTB. Early and accurate identification of at risk patients may permit targeted interventions. Despite great effort, the US PTB rate has actually increased over the past 30y. This failure reflects a poor understanding of the basic mechanisms initiating PTB coupled to a long held assumption that preterm labor (PL) is simply term labor ill timed. Ascending infection from the lower genital is a well-recognized as a mechanism of upper tract inflammation, fetal inflammatory response syndrome, decidual hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis or combinations thereof. Yet, antibiotic therapy has failed to reduce the PTB rate. It is likely other therapeutic strategies are necessary once the innate immunity of the lower genital tract is overwhelmed and the inflammatory cascade established in the upper genital tract or fetal compartment. We hypothesize that PTB reflects an alteration of oxygen independent (defensins and calgranulins) and oxygen dependent (oxygen free radicals) defense mechanisms of the lower and upper genital tract, and that the sequestration of certain polymorphisms in genes regulating the inflammatory cascade among some ethnic groups accounts in part for their risk of recurrent PTB (Specific Aim 1a). We hypothesize women destined for PTB express cervicovaginal biomarkers illustrative of altered innate immunity weeks or months before onset of PTB symptoms (cervical ripening, preterm labor contractions or pPROM) that can be reliably identified using proteomic tools (Specific Aim 1b). We hypothesize that the progesterone compounds reported to decrease recurrent PTB affect maternal lower and upper genital tract defense mechanisms as well as the fetal inflammatory response axis (Specific Aim 2). This proposal brings together an experienced multidisciplinary team who will test elements of these hypotheses in experiments performed over a 5y period.',\n",
       " \"Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity arid mortality. The rate of preterm birth in the United States has increased progressively from 9% to 12% over the past two decades.Recent studies haveshown that prophylactic administration of progesterone (intramuscular or intravaginal) may prevent preterm birth in women with history of spontenous preterm labor. This lead to recommendations by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, March of Dimes and National Institute of Child Health and Development that supplemental progesterone be offered to all womenwith previous history of spontaneous preterm birth. However, it is still unclear which high risk woman would truly benefit from this treatment in a general clinical setting and whether socio-cultural and racial differencesplay a role in patients' response to supplemental progesterone. In addition, the provider and patients acceptance of such recommendation is also in question. The primary aim of this proposal is determine whether the availability of IM 17-P to women with history of spontaneous preterm birth who are seen in the context of routine obstetrical care will result in a significant reduction (33%) in preterm birth. The secondary aims are 1.) To gain a better understanding of the clinical use of 17-P by identifying those who may be eligible for its administration for the prevention of preterm birth and evaluate the barriers to patient's acceptance and adherence including socio-cultural and racial differences, 2.) To develop knowledge regarding potential novel solutions to ensure acceptance and adherence to the use of progesterone supplementation in the reduction of preterm birth, and 3.) To perform assay by design based genotyping of all informative and non-redundant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the genes related to the pathways of the activity of the human progesterone gene (both maternal and fetal cord blood or buccal smear) to determine if there are differences in the human progesterone receptor gene that explain responders and non-responders of 17-P treatment.\",\n",

The SEARCH Study in Hawaii is population-based, with the three health insurance plans participating in the study including in their membership nearly 80% of the population of the State. Approximately 80% of the youth enrolled in SEARCH in Hawaii belong to an ethnic minority group, primarily Asian/Pacific Islanders (API). The Hawaii Center had the highest response rate to in person visits in the study and accounts for approximately half of the API cases included in the study nationwide. SEARCH data indicates that the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes among API was 3 times higher compared to non-Hispanic whites. As a study center, Hawaii offers many advantages including a low rate of uninsured residents and low migration, and due to geographic isolation, diabetes care is received almost exclusively within the State.',\n",

This is a common, integrated application from the six SEARCH clinical sites, which  Droposes to continue and expand the work performed by SEARCH in order to address the following specific research aims: AIM 1: Prospectively ascertain newly diagnosed (2006-2009) incident cases age less than 20 years in order to estimate temporal trends in incidence of DM in youth; AIM 2: Conduct longitudinal follow-up of incident cases already recruited to SEARCH in 2002-2005 in order to document the evolution of newly diagnosed DM accordingto clinical and biochemical factors; AIM 3: Complete analyses initiated in the first five years of SEARCHand expand the scope of quality of care assessment to encompass more broadly defined concepts and measures of quality; AIM 4: Develop and validate simple and low-cost case definitions and classifications of DM types in youth that can be used for public health surveillance. The novelty of this proposal includes its comprehensive nature that brings together major and timely facets of childhood DM research: an epidemiologic study, unique in the United States, of temporal trends in the incidence of DM in youth; a pathophysiologic component addressing the natural history of DM in youth; a study of processes of care and quality of life; and a public health perspective on case classification of DM in youth. This research is critically important to public health as it will provide information about whether and  how much DM is increasing among youth of different racial/ ethnic groups in the United States, about how DM impacts on the physical health, including complications, as well as valuable data regarding the quality of care and the quality of life of these youth. The particular strengths of the South Carolina clinical site include:  1) extensive experience of the investigators in national scientific leadership including leadership in SEARCH publications and SEARCH ancillary studies; 2) a highly stable and experienced local SEARCH clinic staff to ensure efficient operation of the SEARCH project; and 3) success in identification and inclusion of African American youth, including many living in medically underserved communities.',\n",

Practice guidelines have been published, but it is unknown whether they are appropriate for and adhered to in community practice, or whether there are barriers to their implementation. We hypothesize relatively high variation in drug therapy for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (DC). If variation is high for reasons that cannot bejustified, then there maybe opportunities to improve care by changing the forces that drive treatment decision-making. The study will describe the natural history of CD and DC, and whether care is consistent with practice guidelines. It will assess predictors of therapies, visits, and procedures, including predictors at the level of the patient, the disease, the provider, and the clinic. If possible, we will also link predictors and therapies to flare. Patient and disease characteristics will include: (a) the type and severity of IBD, (b) age and demographics, and (c) co-morbidity. Provider characteristics will include (a) specialty, (b) gender and years of experience, (c) IBD patient volume, and (d) actual average use of the procedures and therapies across their IBDpatient panel. Therapies will include: (a) 5ASA medications for maintenance of remission in UC, (b) 6MP/azathioprine for maintenance of remission in patients in CD and UC, (c) steroids, both short- and long-term, (d) infliximab, and (e) patient adherence to medications. Outcomes will include: (a) utilization of visits, procedures, and drugs, and (b) disease flare. In addition, we will qualitatively assess organizational factors, operating at the level of the clinic, that affect therapy decision-making, including staffing, information, guidelines, peer review, and specialist expertise, among others. The study will be conducted at Kaiser Permanente, Northern California. It will include more than 7,000 IBD patients who were enrolled for at least one year as of January 1, 2001 as well 75 gastroenterologists and primary care providers working at 20 clinics across Northern California. Patients will be observedfrom 1995 through 2006, with predictors being assessed during the first half of the 12-year observation period (1995- 2000), utilization during the second half (2001-2006), and drug therapy and disease activity throughout the entire 12-year period. Provider information will be obtainedfrom the computerized provider file with IBD patient volume and actual averagedrug use in their IBD patient panel determined from utilization data.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Diabetes is a leading cause of death in both the United States and Mexico, and the third leading cause of death in the US-Mexico border region.  Although the exact cause of the disease is unknown, and no cure is forthcoming in the near future, it is known that besides genetic predisposition, a number of environmental, economic, social, and cultural factors and barriers may also contribute to this high prevalence rate.  To deal with these factors and barriers the United States Mexico Border Diabetes Prevention and Control Project (USMBDPCP) is proposing to implement and evaluate a family-based participatory intervention delivered by Community Health Workers/Promotores de Salud (CHWs/PS) to help increase the knowledge of appropriate and effective prevention, and control strategies to improve the management of diabetes care among border populations.  The USMBDPCP will evaluate the intervention against the standard diabetes care provided in the community, and will also assess the cost effectiveness of its implementation.  If considered successful, the proposed model will be marketed as a viable intervention model to be implemented in communities and health-care systems along the US-Mexico Border region.  Almost 2,000 participants (660 patients and 1.320 family members) will be recruited in eleven selected communities along the US-Mexico border.  At each site, half of the participants will be randomly enrolled in the proposed intervention and half in a standard diabetes intervention control group.  The research questions to be answered deal with the effectiveness of the intervention, specifically an increase in the number of patients monitoring their blood level, the improvement in the hemoglobin A1C levels and lipid profiles of patients, how the inclusion of the family, or other factors helped improve disease outcomes, and if the intervention was cost-effective.  The intervention implementation process and procedures will be documented and all materials will be made available to CDC for dissemination and replication in other border areas and among other Hispanic populations throughout both countries.

It will facilitate the continuous assessment of diabetes risk factors and the prevalence of diabetes complications in the countries of Central America.  Prior studies conducted by the principal investigator (CAMDI-1 and CAMDI-2), through which basic data on diabetes, related chronic diseases, related risk factors, quality of diabetes care, and capacity for diabetes care has been obtained in Central America, will be used as a foundation for action.  The project's purpose is to enhance countries' capacity for public health research by developing sustainable, national surveillance systems for diabetes, and its related diseases and risk factors.  The goals of the proposed project are:  (1) to stimulate surveillance, epidemiology and economic studies related to diabetes and its related diseases and risk factors; and (2) to establish regional centers to coordinate multi-center studies, pilot test new approaches, and implement workshops / training courses for surveillance, epidemiologic and cost studies.  In the first year of the proposed project, investigators will work to analyze, review, and summarize epidemiologic and surveillance data from Central America, working with existing databases created from the population-based surveys (during CAMDI-1), conducting a multi-center qualitative analysis to summarize the findings of focus groups carried out among health personnel and people with diabetes, and describing characteristics of the quality of diabetes care in each participating centers.  Using this knowledge, investigators will establish a one-to-three-year plan to achieve the purpose and goals of the project.  The proposed project directly supports the Mission of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which is to lead strategic collaborative efforts among Member States and other partners to promote equity in health, to combat disease, and to improve the quality of, and lengthen, the lives of the peoples of the Americas.  Relevance:  The proposed research will enhance Central American countries' capacity to develop sustainable public health surveillance programs which will lead to new knowledge regarding the burden of diabetes in Central America; this knowledge will then be used in public health decision-making.

However, minimal research has been conducted to explore the wider social and economic impact of ERW on individual well-being, family prospects and community development over time.  A human security framework will be utilized in the proposed study to evaluate these psychosocial and economic parameters.  The research design uses a quantitative population-based survey, qualitative interviews of key respondents and focus groups. The study will be conducted in Colombia, Afghanistan and Angola because these countries have suffered extensive and long-lasting exposure to ERW.  The relevance of the proposed study to public health includes the identification and specification of long-term effects of ERW on human populations.  Quantitative and qualitative outcomes include injuries and death to individuals; psychological, social and economic losses to families of landmine victims; and community impacts, such as health indices, economic development, social cohesion and investment behaviors.  The proposed study aims to identify and quantify the relative contribution of de-mining activities on the parameters of individual, family and community well-being.  This type of long-term information has not been systematically gathered for any ERW-affected population in the world to date.

Research sites in Afghanistan are expected to be in the rural and peri-urban areas of Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif and the Panshir Valley region.  Research sites in Angola are expected to be in the provinces of Die and Moxico because the concentration of mines is known to be high in these areas.  Security concerns are not paramount in Angola because landmines are distributed throughout the majority of the country.  Research sites in Colombia are expected to be in the Medellin area because landmines are known to be present and active de-mining efforts are underway in this region.

Preliminary data suggest that Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) can be identified and effectively treated within the newborn period. Objective To develop, validate and implement SCID NBS tests and algorithm(s) for identifying infants with SCID and to make the assay/algorithm(s) available to public health NBS laboratories for implementation of SCID NBS Design, Setting, and Participants A Massachusetts-wide pilot SCID NBS program encompassing universal offering of optional laboratory screening, reporting and follow-up. The initial laboratory-screening algorithm will be integrated into existing Massachusetts (MA) NBS and will comprise a multiplexed assay for T cell recombination excision circles (TRECs) developed by the New England Newborn Screening Program. Evaluation and validation of assays for other markers of SCID will proceed with expectation for a multi-tiered or combinatorial screening algorithm. Enhancements include expansion of the population screened and of states with technical staff trained in SCID NBS. Intervention Infants identified with a positive NBS will be referred for diagnostic evaluation and those with confirmed diagnoses will be treated and followed in accordance with standard of care and consensus guidelines to be developed by the MA SCID NBS Workgroup. Main Outcome Measures Data to be collected include numbers and outcomes of infants with both negative and positive screens. Results Feasibility, sensitivity and specificity of testing all infants for the absence of TRECs as well as clinical validity, sensitivity and specificity of Luminex bead assays for detection of infants with SCID and best-practice algorithms for implementation of SCID NBS.

It will continue for three years, a full scale-fully integrated, SCID pilot program testing all Wisconsin newborns within the NBS program. It will disseminate knowledge and expertise to promote and facilitate SCID-NBS testing. Severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) is a group of life-threatening genetic disorders that occur in an estimated 1 in 66,000 live births. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is highly curative (up to 95% survival) only if the SCID infants are recognized early in life, prior to the acquisition of severe infections. SCID infants appear normal at birth and often have no family history. Hence, most SCID infants are not recognized until diagnosed with life-threatening opportunistic infections, resulting in substantial morbidities and reduced overall survival of 50-70% Thus, the ability to detect newborns prior to the acquisition of infections has tremendous population health impact. During T cell development in the thymus, normal productive rearrangement of the T-cell receptor generates T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) which are present in ~70% of all peripheral naove T- cells(nn,nn). Importantly, all of the known genetic SCID defects lead to severe naove T-cell lymphopenia. In 2006-7, we performed two large-scale studies to determine the feasibility of quantitating TRECs using dried blood spots (DBS) to detect SCID newborns. Based on the success of these pilot studies, which demonstrated the ability to detect blinded SCID samples and a low screening positive rate of ~0.02%, the State of Wisconsin initiated a pilot, prospective newborn screening for SCID on January 1st 2008(nn,nn, nn). Based on these early results, we hypothesize that NBS for SCID by TREC analysis will be a highly robust, sensitive, and cost-effective means of positively identifying SCID within the newborn period. Our proposed approach will not only demonstrate the feasibility of routine NBS for SCID but will research and establish a) a documented testing methodology, b) critical baseline data, i.e. incidence rates, reference ranges, quality assurance protocols, c) referral practices, etc., and d) demonstrate a complete SCID program --- testing, diagnosis and treatment. \"a-d\" are critical to validating the test methodology but also needed to encourage and facilitate the adoption of SCID testing by other states\\' NBS programs. When confirmed by a repeat, duplicate TRECs assay and 2-actin measurement, (both on the initial DBS), a second whole blood specimen is assessed by flow cytometry (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56, CD45 and CD45RO); low counts warrant immediate referral and assessment at the Immune Deficiency Clinic at CHW. \"Data sharing,\" publication and one-on-one collaboration with other state NBS programs will freely disseminate knowledge and expertise and facilitate national adoption of SCID testing.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Project Narrative - relevance to public health Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is an asymptomatic, insidious disease which, untreated, is 100% fatal; SCID can be detected by routine newborn screening (NBS), a vital public health program currently implemented in all 50 states. Properly treated, by bone marrow transplant at less than three months, cure rates of 95% are claimed. 2007 WI data shows the differential cost of treating 5 clinically diagnosed SCID babies and one diagnosed at one week is $2,200,000 each vs $250,000; between 40 and 160 SCID babies (true incidence is unknown) are born in the US each year. NBS for SCID meets the Healthy People 2010 (Maternal, infant and health) mandates to \"reduce infant deaths\" and \"to ensure appropriate newborn blood spot screening.\" We propose a three year project with dual goals: to implement a full scale pilot testing program fully within the Wisconsin State Public Health Laboratory\\'s Newborn Screening Program (concurrent with testing for 47 other conditions) and by doing so demonstrating not only the efficacy of NBS for SCID but also creating a model showing the feasibility of, and requirements for, adding SCID to existing programs in other states. Our SCID-NBS program will not only produce essential baseline data (i.e. incidence rates in the target population), it will detect SCID afflicted newborns born in year 01 through 03.

The International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) was established in 1980 as the lead international coordinating body to provide science-based assessments of the potential health risks posed by environmental contaminants.  IPCS is managed by the World Health Organization (WHO) but involves many other United Nations, regional, international, national, and non-governmental organizations.  IPCS accomplishes most of its work through the efforts of a broad diverse network of internationally recognized scientific experts.  The National Institute of Health (NIH)/National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) played a key role in the formation of IPCS, and NIEHS (intramural and extramural) continues to play a significant leadership role for many IPCS activities.  A WHO/IPCS Interregional Research Unit (IRRU) is located on the NIEHS campus to implement the activities supported by the NIEHS-WHO Cooperative Agreement, which addresses the following global cross-cutting environmental health issues: 1) children's health and the environment; 2) toxicogenomics/gene-environment interactions/biomarkers; 3) persistent toxic substances and endocrine disruptors; 4) improved risk assessment methodologies; and 5) development of an integrated risk assessment approach with an emphasis on mixtures.  A prototype, step-wise implementation strategy, shown to work very effectively has been developed to implement these aims.  This strategy combines a regional approach with a flexible, modular process that allows for uncertainties of unforeseen scientific opportunities, generates unique scientific knowledge, and ultimately leads to the collaboration of research among scientists in developing and developed countries. In addition, this strategy has served as a catalyst for additional multi-partner support and collaborative actions.  The activities supported by the Cooperative Agreement result in numerous publications, training of scientists and health care professionals, collaborative research opportunities, generation of unique scientific information and initiation of data collection archives, education, awareness raising, and information dissemination. Countries use these products to put in place evidence based public health, prevention, and remediation policies at the national and regional level.

       " 'Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the U.S. today, claiming 40,000 lives per year. Several factors, including societal influences on childbearing, diet, and environmental chemicals are believed to be impacting the high rate of breast cancer in this country. Reproductive factors are particularly important in the increased incidence in the U.S., two major factors being the depression in the age of menarche and the extension in the time before first full-term pregnancy. Reasons for the depression in the age of menarche are not fully understood, but appear to be due in part to diet, whereas the delay of childbearing is primarily social. Because the contemporary development and maturation of the breast is during this extended time from menarche to pregnancy, there is further time for toxic influences to have an opportunity to induce tumor formation. Our hypothesis is that diet, in particular fatty acid and phytoestrogen composition and quantity, during the perinatal period and childhood determine the level of adiposity and regulate the hormonal milieu in young children. Through leptin and insulin-like growth factor, adiposity determines the pathway of puberty as being driven primarily by the adrenal gland (adrenarche) or ovaries (thelarche), the latter being associated with early menarche and subsequent risk of breast cancer. In prospective cohorts from in utero to age 3 and age 6 to 12, we shall test the association of diet and adiposity, as well as environmental agents, eg endocrine disruptors and carcinogens, and qualities of the psychosocial environment, with pubertal pathway. Through analysis of hormones, growth factors, and aromatase we shall examine mechanisms through which diet may mediate these effects. In rodent studies we shall test the hypothesis that dietary fatty acid and phytoestrogen composition in utero and early life alter puberty and mammary gland maturation. We further predict that these factors alter the periods of life at which mammary glands are most susceptible to carcinogenic insults. Using the power of gene expression arrays we shall define characteristics of initiated mammary epithelial cells that can be used to examine endogenous and exogenous compounds for their carcinogenic potential and better define initiated mammary cells in animal models and human studies.',\n",

Researchers at the three participating institutions have a long-lasting commitment to breast cancer research, demonstrated through pioneer work that has identified critical windows of susceptibility to carcinogenic and environmental exposures.  The unique experience of this multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary group will provide a broad and comprehensive armarmentarium encompassing varied populations, clinical and basic sciences, and bioinformatics expertise that will be immediately translated to the population it will serve through carefully orchestrated programs under the guidance of patient advocates.  The Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Center proposed here will be named Center for the Study of the Environment and Mammary Gland and Development.  The Center is organized around two research projects, the Collaborative Project 1 (CP 1) and Collaborative Project 2 (CP 2), and two cores, the Administrative Core and the Community Outreach and Translation Core (COTC).  The Administrative Core will serve as a liaison with the Steering Committee of the Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Center Consortium, the Breast Cancer and the Environment Task Force and the National Advisory Board.  In addition, there will be an Executive Committee, which will be chaired by the Principal Investigator and will be integrated by the Co-Principal Investigators and one Cancer Advocate.  The Executive Committee will receive advice from the Internal and the External Advisory Boards.  The Executive Committee will meet on regular basis with the Co-PIs and investigators participating in CP 1 and CP 2, as well as with Members of the Administrative Core and the COTC.  Consequently, the chain of authority for the Center grant will start from the Principal Investigator who will provide scientific leadership for all aspects of the Center.  These lines of authority will not interfere with the internal chain of authority at each one of the participating institutions.  The mission of the Center will be accomplished through interactive meetings among the participants of the Center, and other centers participating in this consortium.',\n",
       " 'The overall objective of the two proposed Center Collaborative Research Projects is to fill specific gaps in our knowledge of the impact of in utero, early postnatal and pubertal environmental exposures on mammary gland development at the cellular, molecular, organ and population levels and their influence on future breast cancer risk. This will be accomplished through 1) an epidemiological study to identify early exposures that can influence breast cancer risk through their effects on breast development in utero through puberty. This study takes advantage of a unique opportunity to follow-up a multiethnic cohort of 500 girls ages 4-11 for whom we have extensive in utero exposures and birth characteristics information and the opportunity to prospectively collect their childhood exposures that influence their hormonal milieu (estrogens, antiestrogens) and growth (diet, exercise, stress, insulin biomarkers), identify relevant genetic polymorphisms and relate them to the timing of pubertal development. 2) The second collaborative research project will use the mouse mammary gland model to determine the molecular mechanisms of mammary gland pubertal development and maturation through in vivo and in vitro studies on the mechanism of progesterone action focusing on the roles of PRA and PRB isoforms. In parallel with the epidemiological studies, the effects of in utero, lactational and postnatal exposures to environmental estrogens, antiestrogens and diet on mammary gland pubertal development and maturation will be determined. Finally, the effect of these environmental exposures on subsequent susceptibility to mammary tumor development will be determined. The overarching hypothesis is that in utero, lactational/formula feeding and post-lactational/childhood exposures to environmental stressors that affect the timing of pubertal development and sexual maturation impact on breast cancer risk. We specifically hypothesize that accelerated pubertal development and early onset of menarche increase breast cancer risk by increasing lifetime exposure to progesterone acting in concert with estrogen. To facilitate the inclusion of community concerns into Center Research Projects we will partner with community advocates and other stakeholders, and be responsive to the input from community-based, faith-based and advocacy organizations that are interested in breast cancer and environmental risks. To optimize translation of new findings into the most effective risk minimization, the Community Outreach and Translation Core will develop strategies and tools to transmit the information to populations of women and girls, as well as community stakeholders and policy-makers.',\n",

Although much is known about the etiology of breast cancer, questions remain about environmental factors that initiate breast cancer carcinogenesis and when they act during the lifespan. The Bay Area Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Center (BABCERC), based at the University of California San Francisco Comprehensive Cancer Center under the leadership of Dr. Robert A. Hiatt, Director of Population Sciences, will address the on-going concerns about the environmental etiology of breast cancer by focusing on mammary gland development during puberty when the breast may be especially vulnerable to environmental influences.  At the same time it will create a unique organizational infrastructure for enhancing the existing partnership of scientists with local community and advocacy groups following the principles of community-based participatory research.  The Bay Area is well suited for such a Center because rates of breast cancer there have been reported as the highest in the nation and there is high interest and cooperation from involved community members, government leaders, health departments, academic institutions and advocacy groups.  Project 1 will study mammary cells and the mammary microenvironment in normal and cancer prone mice during all stages of development to determine the effects of exposure to prototypical environmental stressors in this model and develop in vitro mechanism-based screens to detect agents with possible mammary gland carcinogenicity.  Project 2 proposes to recruit a cohort of approximately 400 7-8 year old girls from the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and follow them through the pubertal transition.  Data will be collected during a 6 year follow-up period from questionnaires, physical examination, and biospecimens that will allow analyses of links between environmental factors and mammary development, including the possible importance of susceptibility associated with selected gene-environment interactions.  The Community Outreach and Translational Core will be directed and comprised of leaders in the local breast cancer advocacy movements in Marin and San Francisco Counties, who are highly experienced working with their respective communities on the topic of this research.  The COTC activities are both highly integrated and interactive with the research projects and well connected to the community and its concerns.  By incorporating the skills of a broad spectrum of expertise in fields such as developmental biology, epidemiology, and community advocacy, the BABCERC will provide an exciting opportunity for transdisciplinary research on a significant societal and biomedical challenge...understanding the relationship of breast cancer to the environment.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Nearly a decade ago, Risch and Merikangas suggested the possibility of conducting genome-wide association scans. Although the cost was prohibitive at the time, they predicted that these technological barriers would eventually be overcome. With the advent of 500K chip-based or bead technologies, at a cost of about 0.2 cents per genotype, that prediction has now become a reality. Nevertheless, these will still be expensive studies to conduct and there remain numerous methodological challenges to efficient and valid design of such studies. To address these issues, we convened a panel of 165 investigators from around the world at USC in April 2005. These discussions highlighted a number of study design and statistical analysis problems that we propose to continue working on as part of this Cooperative Agreement. Our team is also involved in conducting and planning several such studies for such conditions as breast, colon, and prostate cancer and age-related macular degeneration. We anticipate that this research will inform the conduct of these studies and be motivated by the needs of these projects (as well as the many others at other institutions). In particular, we propose to focus on the following methodological issues: (1) tag SNP selection and haplotype-based methods incorporating both case-control association and case-case sharing comparisons; (2) multiple testing procedures for multistage sampling designs, including hierarchical models for prioritizing SNPs for further consideration using external genomic data; (3) family- vs. population-based studies and allowance for population stratification and admixture; and (4) gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. To investigate these problems, we will apply the methods to real data from our own studies (the Multiethnic Cohort and the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study of age-related macular degeneration), as well as data available in public databases such as the HapMap Project. Since most genome-wide datasets are limited to relatively small samples and are not connected to any phenotype information, we will develop ways for using these real data to generate large populations that would contain realistic degrees of genetic diversity that would look like those seen in these small samples. We will then sample from these populations to simulate replicate case-control data sets under known phenotype models to investigate the statistical performance of alternative study designs and analysis methods.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute high-level exposures to chemicals that damage the respiratory tract can cause life-threatening lung injury. Chlorine gas is a highly toxic respiratory irritant that when inhaled causes cellular injury, alveolar- capillary barrier disruption, inflammation, and pulmonary edema. We are investigating mechanisms by which G proteins, which are ubiquitous intracellular signaling molecules, regulate lung injury, inflammation, and repair. During the course of the proposed research we will investigate how G protein-mediated signaling pathways regulate injury and inflammation that are induced when lungs, or lung cells, are exposed to chlorine gas. We will then apply the information gained from these studies to develop novel treatment strategies based on modulation of G protein function to ameliorate acute lung injury. G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which control cellular homeostasis and responses to environmental stimuli, are activated by a variety of neuropeptides, inflammatory mediators, and hormones that are released following tissue injury. GPCRs activate intracellular signaling pathways by stimulating G proteins that have been classified into four families: Gq, Gs, Gj, and Gi2. We have observed that activation of Gq in lung epithelial cells stimulates proinflammatory gene expression, whereas activation of Gs promotes increased survival following injury. In the proposed experiments, we will use manipulation of Gq and Gs signaling pathways as potential therapeutic measures to treat acute lung injury induced by inhalation of chlorine gas. In Specific Aim 1 we will examine mechanisms by which Gq signaling promotes activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-KB and Gs inhibits chlorine toxicity in cultured epithelial and endothelial cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine, using an inducible, cell-specific knockout mouse model, whether Gq signaling in lung epithelial cells is a therapeutic target for ameliorating acute lung injury. In Specific Aim 3, we will develop treatment strategies, including cell-soluble Gq inhibitory peptides and Gq siRNA, for chlorine-induced lung injury based on inhibition of Gq function. In Specific Aim 4, we will optimize the in vivo delivery of therapeutic agents for chlorine-induced lung injury based on inhibition of Gq function and stimulation signaling pathways downstream of Gs. This application is submitted in response to RFA-NS-06-004, \"Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats.\" The proposed experiments are designed to understand how inhalation of a toxic chemical injures the lung and, based on this information, to develop novel ways to treat or prevent acute lung injury. This type of research is sought through the RFA because of concerns that U. S. civilians could be adversely affected by highly toxic chemicals released intentionally in terrorist attacks or unintentionally in industrial accidents or natural disasters.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensory nerve endings in the skin, airways, eyes and mucous membranes are activated by a wide range of hazardous chemicals. These include pulmonary chemical agents as well as vesicants and noxious industrial chemicals. Activation of sensory nerve endings in the nasal passages and airways induces pain, irritation and apnea. Extended chemical exposure promotes injury by causing the release of inflammatory neuropeptides that contribute to edema formation in the lung and skin, ocular damage, mucus hypersecretion, pulmonary obstruction, and blister formation. In animal models these effects can be strongly reduced by prior neural desensitization or denervation. Thus, pharmacological blockade of neural activation, as well as block of neuropeptide receptors in target tissues, could represent effective measures to prevent and alleviate the deleterious effects of pulmonary agents and vesicants. The molecular targets for pulmonary agents and vesicants on sensory neurons are largely unknown. Recently, a new class of sensory chemoreceptors, the TRP ion channels, was discovered. The founding member, TRPV1, is the receptor for capsaicin, the pungent and inflammatory ingredient in chili peppers that is used as an incapacitating agent. TRPA1, a novel TRP ion channel, is activated by mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate), a potent irritant and neuroinflammatory agent. We found that TRPA1 is exclusively expressed in sensory fibers that are also sensitive to capsaicin. Mustard oil and other plant-derived activators of TRPA1 show intriguing structural similarities with sulfur mustard. In addition, we found that TRPA1 is strongly activated by hazardous industrial chemicals. These include a,p-unsaturated aldehydes such as acrolein, a pulmonary agent used in the First World War. Our functional and behavioral analysis of mice deficient in TRPA1 showed that TRPA1 is essential for sensory neural responses to mustard oil, acrolein and other chemical hazards. Thus TRPA1, and potentially other TRP channels, may represent effective targets to prevent and treat the toxic effects of pulmonary agents and vesicants. Our specific aims are to investigate the role of TRP channels in the response to pulmonary agents and vesicants in vitro and in vivo and to analyze the efficacy of TRP channel blockers and neuropeptide antagonists in the reduction of warfare agent toxicity.

       " 'Even without signs of external injury, chemical exposure can produce severe trauma to internal target organs including the lungs, heart, gastrointestinal tract, eyes, and the central nervous system. Of these injuries, the extent of lung injury often is the most critical to survival. Chemical Induced Acute Lung Injury (CIALI) can be viewed as a molecular cascade mounting over hours and days subsequent to even a transient incident. Unfortunately, CIALI is a likely consequence of terrorist attacks of multiple possible scenarios including intentional detonation of chemical plants, railroad car derailment, or chemical truck hijacking. Chemicals of high concern include chlorine, phosgene, sulfuric acid, ammonia, and acrolein. Predictive strategies will require the monitoring of multiple biochemical indicators forming complex molecular signatures. Our goal is to understand the genetic, global transcriptomal, and molecular events that will provide insights into the mechanisms of CIALI and could redirect or strengthen current emergency clinical approaches to diagnosis and treatment. The objective of this application is to determine the molecular mechanism(s) and therapeutic efficacy of TGFalpha and FGF7 in enhancing survival in this condition. Our central hypothesis is that the interplay between TGFalpha, FGF7, and TGFbeta signaling determines survival and controls the susceptibility to sequelae from CIALI. To explore our hypothesis, we seek to: 1) Identify the genetic determinants and molecular mechanisms controlling CIALI common to exposure to 5 leading hazardous chemicals: chlorine, phosgene, sulfuric acid, ammonia, and acrolein, 2) Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of TGFalpha and FGF7 induction and signaling during CIALI and determine whether pulmonary fibrosis is a necessary sequela as a consequence of protection, and 3) Identify the molecular mechanisms that are unique to each of the 5 leading hazardous chemicals during the early development of CIALI. At the completion of this project, we expect to: 1) Identify novel genetic differences that determine the susceptibility to CIALI, 2) Identify the events modulated during CIALI that are common to multiple agents 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of therapies by that lead to protection in CIALI, 4) Determine whether pulmonary fibrosis is an untoward consequence of activating TGFalpha/FGF7signaling during CIALI, 5) Develop an initial chemical specific database on the selective signatures of the 5 leading hazardous chemicals.',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chlorine (C12) is a moderately soluble, highly reactive oxidant gas, used extensively for water purification, manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals and chemicals and as a potent disinfectant. Persons exposed to chlorine gas, may experience mild symptoms for the first 6-24 hours (h). However, following this latency period, severe lung injury, characterized by protein-rich edema and the onset of hypoxemia may develop. Presently, the cellular and biochemical events leading to this injury have not been elucidated. We propose that reactive oxygen-chloride and nitrogen intermediates (RONS), formed by the interaction of C12 and its hydrolysis products with nitric oxide (NO), initiate self-propagating chain reactions, the products of which damage alveolar epithelial cells decreasing their ability to produce and secrete surfactant, actively transport sodium (Na+) ions and maintain a tight, semi-permeable barrier. Thus, systemic administration of reactive species scavengers (such as ascorbate, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), and deferoxamine, as well as agents that augment surfactant levels, ion transport and paracellular resistance (such as albuterol (a long acting b-agonist) and a recently described peptide based on the lectin region of TNFa (tip peptide), shortly after exposure to C12 will decrease lung injury, morbidity and mortality. This hypothesis will be tested by exposing either confluent monolayers of rat alveolar type II (ATII) epithelial cells (SPECIFIC AIM # 1) or rats (SPECIFIC AIMS #2) to C12 (50-200 ppm for 30 min) and measure the following indices at 0.5, 6, 12 and 24 h post exposure: physiological and biochemical indices of lung function (including surfactant function and composition), ability of the lungs to transport ions in vivo and in vitro and clear pulmonary edema in vivo, levels of inflammatory cytokines in the rat alveolar space and in the plasma, arterial blood gases and pH, as well as levels of low reactive species scavengers (ascorbate, NAC) at 0.5, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h post exposure. These measurements will be repeated following intravenous injections of NAC, ascorbate and deferoxamine as well as albuterol and the tip peptide, every 6 h post exposure for 48 h. In SPECIFIC AIM #3 , we will assess the efficacy of intratracheally instilled ascorbate, NAC, deferoxamine, Infasurf (a surfactant replacement mixture), albuterol and the tip peptide, as well as aerosolized albuterol, in prolonging survival of rats with respiratory failure post C12 exposure. The subject matter of this research is both timely and important: more than 25 million tons of chlorine is manufactured annually in the United States and the majority of this gas is transported by rail and can be used as a chemical weapon.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Direct lung injury, with pulmonary complications, accounted for most of the deaths following toxic chemical exposure in the Iran-Iraq- war, the accidental release of methyl isocyanate in Bhopal, India, the Tokyo subway sarin attack, and the hostage crisis in Moscow. These tragedies exemplify how susceptible human airways are to the effects of airborne chemicals and imply that respiratory management is most important and critical for saving life. Previous reports indicate that chemical injury is associated with direct chemical reaction followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome and late complications. A large number of civilians and an increasing number of children with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma are more vulnerable to chemical threat agents. We propose to investigate the respiratory toxicity and lung injury following inhalation exposure to the deadly chemical threat agent sarin in animal models. Our recently developed micro-instillation technology of inhalation exposure will be used for sarin vapor exposure. Micro-instillation technology bypasses the detoxification of chemical threat agents in the airway of rodents, which have high levels of carboxylesterase and mucus. Thus, the chemical agents reach alveoli and mimics an exposure similar to human. The respiratory toxicity will be assessed by toxicological, biochemical, histopathological and respiratory functional analysis. The chronology of lung injury will be also assessed. We ill identify bronchoalveolar lavage, blood biomarkers or non-invasive respiratory parameters to diagnose the severity of exposure. A number of FDA-approved or in clinical trial as well as new therapeutic regimens will be evaluated to develop an effective medical countermeasure against pulmonary injury and its long-term consequences. We will also assess the respiratory toxicity of sarin in animals models of pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma. Potential therapeutics will be evaluated for protection against sarin exposure in asthma model. The proposed studies will define the biochemical mechanisms of respiratory toxicity and lung injury that play a central role in chemical threat agent induced toxicity and a major cause of death following exposure in normal and vulnerable populations with pre-existing medical conditions. Effective therapeutics to protect against pulmonary toxicity and its long-term consequences that can complement the existing modalities will be rapidly developed for a mass scenario.

Animal and population studies suggest an imprinting phenomenon whereby early exposure of xenoestrogen can lead to tumorigenesis later in life. The molecular mechanism by which these environmental stressors can transform breast genomes is not well understood. Our preliminary data prompt us to hypothesize that epigenetic alteration, in the form of CpG island hypermethylation, transmits this imprinted information to the progeny of undifferentiated cells pre-exposed to xenoestrogens. Specifically, we propose that immature cells located in the stem/progenitor compartment of the human breast are prime targets of this environmental insult. In Specific Aim 1, primary breast stem/progenitor cells will be exposed to xenoestrogens - diethylstilbestrol, bisphenol A, or 17(3-estradiol in an in vitro system. 'Global analysis is expected to identify altered methylation status in 1-2% of ~29,000 CpG islands analyzed. These epigenetic events can be the direct results of exposing stem/progenitor cells to xenoestrogens. The epigenetic memory of this injury is then transmitted to differentiated epithelial cells and in turn leads to breast tumorigenesis in a xenograft model. In Specific Aim 2, we will functionally determine whether the prolonged exposure of these endocrine chemicals to stem/progenitor cells disrupt the homeostasis of estrogen signaling and triggers an epigenetic cascade in its downstream targets. Polycomb repressors can be recruited to promoter CpG islands followed by the addition of DNA methyltransferases at these promoters. Acquired DMA methylation, as a result of increased local methyltransferase activities, marks the heritable gene silencing. In Specific Aim 3, we will demonstrate that CpG island hypermethylation induced by xenoestrogen exposure is also observed in clinical samples. The presence of these molecular alterations in primary breast tumors may constitute a xenoestrogen epigenotype(s). In this regard, patients exhibiting this epigenotype are likely exposed to xenoestrogens in their early lives. In addition, low levels of these methylation changes may exist in normal looking mammary epithelial, leaving a field of cancerization in the human breast. This type of CpG island hypermethylation can be tracked as molecular relics using a mathematical modeling approach developed in our laboratory. We will develop the model further to recreate the history of xenoestrogen- induced breast tumorigenesis, from pre-neoplastic lesions to hyperplasia to carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma. Clinical sensitivity and specificity of potential CpG island loci pinpointing the xenoestrogen epigenotype will be provided as a quantitative milestone for this U01 project. These loci are future biomarkers for early breast cancer detection and are putative biosensors to environmental estrogens.   [unreadable]   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",

We will develop the model further to recreate the history of xenoestrogen- induced breast tumorigenesis, from pre-neoplastic lesions to hyperplasia to carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma. Clinical sensitivity and specificity of potential CpG island loci pinpointing the xenoestrogen epigenotype will be provided as a quantitative milestone for this U01 project. These loci are future biomarkers for early breast cancer detection and are putative biosensors to environmental estrogens.   [unreadable]   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",

Our specific aims are: 1) to use microarray technology to measure genomic biomarkers of exposure from blood serum and buffy coat, and buccal swabs from (pre)pubertal girls and rats exposed to these chemicals; 2) to develop sensitive and reproducible methods (2D-PAGE and mass spectrometry) to measure protein biomarkers of exposure in blood plasma of (pre)pubertal girls and rats that are expressing high and low levels of these chemicals. An important aspect of this application is not only in the development of new, and use of present state of the art technology for identification of biomarkers of biological responses, but in the experimental design of using a rat model of exposure and a human cohort in similar biological conditions (puberty), also exposed to the same compounds. This unique experimental design will compare the genomic and proteomic changes in a target organ, in this case the rat mammary gland with the presence of peripheral changes in the animals. Whereas in humans we can not detect the changes in the target tissue, the experimented data will give us unbiased information on the target tissue and the peripheral tissue/body fluids that will be important to bioinformatically correlate with the human data. These studies can have a double relevance by first customizing biomarkers identified in a custom array for genes and proteins and second by providing the basis for future assessing these changes for evaluating risk in a larger population. This body of work will be possible because we are utilizing already procured samples from (pre)pubescent girls identified to have high chemical exposures and will have circulating hormone concentrations as indicators of puberty and exposure. From girls (and rats) going through puberty whose urine identifies them as being exposed to high or low concentrations of specific environmental chemicals, we will measure differentially regulated genes and proteins from the blood as biological indicators of chemical exposure. In the rats, we will also measure genes and proteins in the mammary glands as a function of exposure and puberty to gain insight into how environmental chemical exposure early in life predisposes for breast cancer later in life.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Exposure and biological response biomarkers of cigarette smoke. Exposure to tobacco smoke (mainstream and environmental) is a leading cause of death in the US. Cigarette smoke is an extremely complex mixture, which some 3800 constituents including numerous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in both the mainstream and sidestream (environmental) smoke fractions. Cigarette smokers provide an extreme model of PAH exposure that will permit both exposure and biological response biomarkers to be developed. There is substantial evidence that PAHs are causative agents in lung, skin, and bladder cancer. Furthermore, tobacco smoke is associated with oxidative stress, pancreatic cancer, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although the specific role of PAHs is not clear. Interestingly, the cardiovascular effects of sidestream smoke are almost as great as mainstream smoke. The present proposal stems from significant advances we have made over the last six years in the quantification of protein, lipid, and DNA biomarkers using stable isotope methodology and our basic research into enzyme regulation during oxidative stress. Previous methods for analyzing oxidative DNA damage have been fraught with numerous methodological problems so that the current state-of-the-art involves the use of a COMET assay to measure 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (dGuo) lesions. We have recently devised a more quantitative method based on immunoaffinity stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) that can be readily elaborated to studies of tobacco smokers. We also showed that oxidative stress could induce the formation of aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) of the 1C family. AKR1C3 is the enzyme, which we recently showed is responsible for the conversion of prostaglandin (PG) D2 to the potent bronchoconstrictor 11p-PGF2. This provides an additional potential link between oxidative stress and COPD as well as the potential for a new therapeutic strategy, which involves AKR1C3 inhibition. Finally, preliminary studies have revealed that a DNA-adduct than can only arise from lipid peroxidation is present in the urine of cigarette smokers but is completely absent in urine from non-smokers. We propose to build on these exciting new findings by developing panels of in vivo biomarkers of exposure and biological response, which we hypothesize will make it possible to distinguish a cohort of non-smokers from a cohort of disease-free tobacco smokers. The hypothesis will be tested by conducting research under the following three specific aims: Aim 1. To discover whether B[a]P and B[a]P-7,8-dione induce AKR1C/2 in NHBE cells and increase oxidative stress to form 8-oxo-dGuo and HedGuo in DNA, induce AKR1C3 in HASM cells and increase the biosynthesis of the potent bronchoconstrictor 11p-PGF2, as potential urine and EEC biological response biomarkers of PAH exposure. Aim 2: To discover secreted proteins following treatment of NHBE and HASM cells with B[a]P and its oxidative metabolites as potential serum biological response biomarkers of PAH exposure. Aim 3: To conduct predictive and refinement analyses of in vivo exposure and response biomarkers in urine together with biological response biomarkers in EBC and serum in order to distinguish non-smokers from disease-free tobacco smokers. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a panel of biomarkers of exposure and biological response to tobacco smoke will have significant utility in future studies designed to elucidate the relationship between gene environment interactions and diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and COPD.

In addition to obesity, chronic alcohol consumption leads to excessive hepatic free fatty acid (FFA) levels that inhibit [unreadable]-oxidation pathways and ultimately cause liver disease (steatosis, inflammation, hepatomegaly, fibrosis, and cirrhosis). Interestingly, the adverse effects of alcohol on the liver, in humans and in mouse models, appear to be due, in part, to attenuation of the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARa). The alcohol-fed Ppara-null mouse serves as an excellent model for ALD observed in humans and underscores the importance of PPARa in protecting against ALD. Additionally, this mouse model has been cited in over 750 publications supporting its significant utility in understanding the role of PPARa. The mechanism of the influence of PPARa will be determined for potential therapeutic intervention strategies on ALD and for the development of biomarkers for early detection of this disease. To this end, the following specific aims were designed: 1) To correlate alcohol-induced liver damage with gene expression and metabolomic biomarkers identified in alcohol-fed Ppara-null mice for the purpose of developing specific ALD biomarkers.; 2) To identify potential epigenetic and post-transcriptional changes associated with decreased PPARa expression in mouse models following alcohol consumption; and 3) To develop toxicogenomic and toxicometabolomic signatures for types of alcohol-induced injury using primary hepatocyte cultures. These aims seek to understand and integrate the histopathological, genomic, and metabolomic alterations associated with ALD for the purpose of developing early biomarkers associated with ALD pathogenesis.

These changes provoke shifts in molecular components of the blood that reflect changes in biomarker levels. Septic patients and rheumatoid arthritis patients will be used as prototype stressed individuals to identify and quantify the presence of serum proteins that have increased, decreased, or which display epitope-modified expression. These molecular features will form the basis of specific biomarker signatures that are characteristic of stressed human individuals. Preliminary experiments document that biological, chemical, and psychological stress alters plasma protein expression levels, which in part, are due to inflammation and/or oxidative processes. Since we suggest the different forms of stressors modulate the interactive pathways between the endocrine, immune, and nervous systems, we anticipate that immune, endocrine, and nervous system factors will be predictors of stress and that the profiles of these factors will provide prognosis for the degree of stress and the severity of the exposure. Individual biomarkers, which are predicted to relate to regulatory pathways associated with inflammation: anti-inflammation, oxidants: anti-oxidants, and innate immune processes, will then be quantified in humanized mice after exposure to three prototype stressors: cadmium, cold-restraint, and listerial infection. The plan is to delineate and quantify the normal basal and responsive plasma concentrations of relevant biomarkers and to validate their analysis with a new biosensor employing grating- coupled surface plasmon resonance imaging (GCSPRI). GCSPRI is a microarray platform that will enable the multiplexed detection of these biomarker signatures with an automated diagnostic system in near real time. In addition to stressor-induced changes in plasma constituents, we will evaluate changes to blood leukocyte antigens; lymphocytes are especially sensitive to inflammatory products and oxidants. Blood products are obtained with minimal invasiveness, and they represent the best composite of the systemic response to a stressor. The GCSPRI technology will be parallel tested against the Luminex technology. The biomarkers to be evaluated include blood clotting factors, cytokines, stress proteins, neuropeptides, antioxidant enzymes, and normal plasma proteins with thiol-related modifications. Finally, we will evaluate the consequences of different stress response capabilities on the character of the biomarker signatures that have been identified in this work. At the conclusion of this work we will have identified specific biomarker signatures that are both diagnostic of specific signatures, and which will be invaluable in both the diagnosis of stress, and the characterization of therapeutic management of stressed individuals.

The public health implications of this widespread environmental exposure are profound; tobacco smoke is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States and is projected to cause nearly 450 million deaths worldwide during the next 50 years. Despite the causal role of cigarette smoking in lung cancer and COPD, only 10-20% of smokers develop these diseases. There are few indicators of which smokers are at highest risk for disease, and it is unclear why individuals remain at high risk decades after they have stopped smoking. Current standard methods for quantifying exposure to tobacco smoke are limited in their ability to accurately assess cumulative dose and past exposure, and they do not capture the physiologic host response to tobacco exposure. We have previously shown that cigarette smoke causes an airway-wide epithelial cell \"field of injury\" and that gene expression, in airway epithelial cells obtained at bronchoscopy, reflects host response to smoking. We propose here to extend the \"field of injury\" concept to easily-accessible airway epithelial cells that can be obtained from nasal or buccal mucosa in a non-invasive fashion. By measuring global gene expression at these sites using a new \"all-exon\" expression platform, we will develop a series of biomarkers that assess host response to current tobacco exposure (active vs. passive vs. never smokers), intensity of current exposure, cumulative exposure among current smokers, time since last exposure among smokers who recently quit, and lifetime exposure. Furthermore, we will develop molecular pathway-based gene expression biomarkers that may be more accurate markers of individual responses to tobacco smoking. We also propose to correlate airway gene expression biomarkers with lung function and systemic markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, setting the stage for a more detailed understanding of how variability in epithelial response contributes to variability in disease-related pulmonary and systemic sequelae of tobacco smoke exposure. These studies will establish a new non-invasive tool that can be used to measure the host responses to tobacco smoke that can be used in subsequent large scale population studies as part of the Genes and Environment Initiative.

Furthermore, we will develop molecular pathway-based gene expression biomarkers that may be more accurate markers of individual responses to tobacco smoking. We also propose to correlate airway gene expression biomarkers with lung function and systemic markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, setting the stage for a more detailed understanding of how variability in epithelial response contributes to variability in disease-related pulmonary and systemic sequelae of tobacco smoke exposure. These studies will establish a new non-invasive tool that can be used to measure the host responses to tobacco smoke that can be used in subsequent large scale population studies as part of the Genes and Environment Initiative.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] DNA damage is an important risk factor for cancer and many other diseases. Whether induced by the environment or created endogenously, covalent modifications to DNA structure can be both cytotoxic and mutagenic. Being able to measure DNA damage and repair in human samples is therefore fundamentally valuable, both for delineating environmental conditions that render cells vulnerable to mutations, and for revealing genetic factors that modulate susceptibility to DNA damage. The single cell gel electrophoresis assay, or \\'comet assay\\' is one of the most sensitive and versatile approaches for measuring DNA damage in human cells. It is grounded on a simple principle: when visualizing electrophoresed cells embedded in agarose, undamaged DNA is supercoiled and highly compact, whereas damaged DNA (relaxed loops and fragments) can more readily migrate, giving rise to the appearance of a bright nucleoid with a comet-like tail. Despite its proven efficacy, the comet assay is underutilized in studies of environmental risk factors in epidemiological studies, mostly because of a lack of standardization that has lead to inconsistent results among researchers and due to the time/labor required to perform the assay. Here, we propose to apply lab- on-a-chip technologies to create a \"comet-chip\" that will not only overcome problems in standardization, but will also permit high-throughput parallel processing of dozens of samples. We anticipate that the proposed technology will render this assay useful in a broad range of clinical, epidemiological, and experimental settings. In Specific Aim I, droplet-array methodology will be exploited for parallel processing of dozens of samples. Specific Aim II is aimed at combining cell patterning technologies with the comet assay in order to asses the impact of microenvironment on variability among cells. For Specific Aim III, we propose to create a self-contained comet device to provide much needed consistency. Finally, for Specific Aim IV, we propose to apply the \\'comet chip\\' to mouse and human samples of varied DNA repair capacities, and to rigorously evaluate reproducibility and sensitivity. Importantly, while sophisticated equipment will be necessary for the highest-end processor that we propose to create, many of the proposed modifications can be applied to the comet assay in a fairly low-tech fashion, and thus can be widely disseminated. A high- throughput DNA damage and response sensor will be invaluable both for discerning dangerous environmental exposures, and for evaluating the efficacy of policy decisions aimed at reducing relevant exposures. It is hoped that the proposed technology will yield data to empower policy makers in the development of wise intervention strategies that will effectively prevent cancer and other illnesses, long before disease onset.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Links between diet and human disease, and between reactive species and disease, are so commonly considered as to lie in the realm of textbooks and the popular press. Links between mitochondria and energy production are generally appreciated by junior high school. Links between mitochondria and calcium (including signaling), free radicals, or cell death may be less known to the general public, but each has in excess of 10,000 PubMed citations. However, despite broad and strong theoretical considerations supporting casual connections between diet effects on mitochondria and diet effects on disease - and some specific experimental support - there are, to our knowledge, no systematic studies that bridge this fundamental gap. Bridging this gap is central to understanding environment-gene interactions, as suboptimal dietary macronutrient choices are arguably the major environmental stressor in individuals living in Western societies. We therefore propose to bridge this gap using an interdisciplinary, product-development approach to discover and confirm innovative plasma metabolomic and proteomic biomarkers for dietary intake of subclasses of fats and carbohydrates, and for their effects on mitochondrial (dys)function. We will then validate these markers by using them to test the hypothesis that diet-associated effects on mitochondria are linked to diet-associated changes in disease risk. Five Aims are proposed. Aim 1 To determine the effects of dietary changes in fatty acid and carbohydrate composition on mitochondrial physiology Aim 2 To determine the effects of dietary changes in fatty acid and carbohydrate composition on the plasma metabolome and proteome Aims 3 and 4: To determine the extent to which adherence to/presence of each diet, dietary constituent, and mitochondrial property predict type II diabetes (Aim 3) and breast cancer (Aim 4) in previously profiled case control studies nested within the Nurses' Health Study Aim 5: To provide an electronic archive of the metabolomic and proteomic constituents of the blood of participants that could be repeatedly mined for future testing of new hypotheses. The proposed studies are directly responsive to the RFA and further general NIH goals of focusing on health and early interventions rather than late stage disease.

Portable air sampling devices that fit inside the nostrils and have been used in Australian and European asthma studies will be used for collection of samples in an ongoing study of inner-city New York homes of children (n=200) with increased risk for developing allergy and asthma. Highly multiplexed protein microarrays, allowing parallel assessment of many allergens, integrated onto active complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) substrates will be employed. The use of CMOS allows highly integrated and sensitive devices to be developed because of the immediate proximity of the detector to the sensing electronics. As the commodity technology for microelectronics, such active substrates can be produced at very low cost. An established fluorescence based sensor substrate will be employed for initial studies, augmented by simple microfluidic delivery. Biosensor technology development will include efforts toward real-time measurement capabilities including more complex microfluidic delivery (including pressure activated valves), real-time fluorescence sensing through lifetime-sensitive FRET, and CMOS-integrated mass-based biosensors. The same principles for assessment of allergens in air can be applied to assessment of bacterial and fungal pathogens and their constitutive toxins.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Current studies suggest that several human diseases involve gene-environment interaction. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are neurodevelopmental and immunological toxicants in experimental animals treated prenatally. Association with neurobehavioral deficits is found in some but not in all epidemiological studies of environmental exposures, with data suggesting the prenatal period to be the most sensitive. The majority of the studies evaluating the impact of PCBs on chronic health conditions, however, have been epidemiological. The proposed study therefore evaluates prenatal and postnatal PCB exposure in relation to identification of disease biomarkers through particular gene expressions at birth and at early childhood. The purpose of this research is to identify biomarkers for PCB induced diseases through gene expression studies that can be used globally in the future for early diagnosis of diseases in humans following environmental stress. This proposal hypothesizes that exposure to PCBs for individuals in the Michalovce district of the Slovak Republic is associated with diseases caused by oxidative stresses, endocrine disruption, and mitochondrial poisoning. This hypothesis is based on the following observations. First, there are several PCBs and metabolites of PCBs that have been isolated from human blood and tissues, and the gene cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1), which mediates production of OH-PCB by oxidative metabolism, has been found to be 65-fold increased by PCB-77 in cellular studies in vitro in the Pi's lab. Second, these metabolites are able to transmit across the placental barrier and be transferred to the human fetus. Third, with few exceptions, most adverse effects of background levels of PCBs were primarily related to prenatal exposure. Reported effects of background exposures in infants include reduced birth weight, less postnatal growth, impaired development, impaired immune-response, and lower thyroid hormone level. It is unknown whether these effects are caused by the PCBs themselves or by their metabolites. Fourth, high affinity binding of hydroxylated PCBs to Transthyretin (TTR) results in selective delivery of these hormones over the blood-brain barrier and over the placenta to the fetal compartment where they produce a hypothyroid effect. Fifth, in vitro tests with human liver and kidney cells clearly show that PCBs alter gene expression which has been connected with specific diseases. These diseases are not related to non-genetic factors, and Sixth, several animal and epidemiological studies suggest that prenatal exposure to PCBs and related compounds results in lower birth rates. The aims to achieve our goal in this proposal are AIM 1: To refine and confirm prior genome-wide gene expression patterns upon exposure of PCBs or its metabolites in human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) (in vitro) to correlate risk to that of PCBs. AIM 2: To obtain genomic biomarkers of diseases caused by PCBs or its metabolites in early childhood. AIM 3: to validate candidate biomarkers in randomized studies in large scale population studies. The goal would be to improve our ability to study this process in its early stages before the clinical sign arises. These personalized measures of exposures will be combined with genomic information to decipher environmental and genetic risk factors for disease development and progression. Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays, followed by real-time RT-PCR will be used for human gene expression studies. Epidemiological studies will include the current body burden, and time-dependent changes in congener profiles in longitudinal studies in newborn babies using Slovak population. The Slovak population is the worst hit by the PCBs comparing any other parts of the world. Besides, co-principal investigators have excellent epidemiological database funded by US-NIH, which provide unique opportunities for the proposed genomic biomarkers using PCB-exposed human population. The complementary database will be established to find correlation of PCBs and disease development for comparative statistical analysis. The proposed collaborative studies are expected to facilitate ongoing epidemiological and health effect studies of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to develop early disease biomarkers and are important for understanding the potential health risk from these compounds in general. This research will also reside with its ability to use non-invasive gene expression tools to study the early pathogenesis of the disease and to help the nation develop early intervention for multiple chronic disease that continue to burden our health system.

This epigenetic data, along with genetic and expression data will be integrated using advanced informatics (aim 5) to address fundamental roles of epigenetics in differentiation, maintenance of cell-type identity and gene expression. Our cell and data production pipeline will incorporate verification and data validation with independent methods, and will operate under a model motivated by increased data production and decrease cost. We summarize the analysis capacity of our instruments and our explicit strategy for data sharing of our proposed REMC-generated resources including biological specimens, protocols, data, software tools and intellectual resources. We envision that our group in conjunction with the other REMC teams, the EDACC, ENCODE, future EHHD (Epigenetics of Human Health and Disease) centers and the NIH Roadmap program will develop methods, tools and reference epigenome maps for the research community that will make the promise of epigenetics in understand and treating human complex disease a reality. Our reference epigenomes will enable new disciplines including human population epigenetics, comparative epigenomics, neuroepigenetics, and therapeutic epigenetics for tissue regeneration and reversal of disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epigenome is the dynamic interface between our changing environment and the static genome, and understanding it is a goal of immense importance to human health. We will map reference cell epigenomes of the brain, breast, blood and approved embryonic stem cells, inclusive of males and females and different racial groups. This cooperative work will transform our understanding of the short and long-lasting consequences of environment impact on human health and disease.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers (REMC) will aim to transform our understanding of human epigenetics through production and integrative analysis of comprehensive reference epigenomes for ES cells, differentiated cells and tissues. In pursuit of this goal, we have assembled a unique scientific team and infrastructure with broad expertise and capabilities in stem cell biology, epigenomics, technology, production research and computation. We recently demonstrated two complementary methods that leverage ultra high-throughput sequencing for epigenomic analysis. In the first method, genome-wide chromatin maps are acquired by deep sequencing chromatin IP DNA (ChlP-Seq). In the second, nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps are generated by high-throughput bisulfite-sequencing (HTBS). These methods represent major improvements over prior tools as they yield precise digital information, have high genome coverage, require fewer cells and are cost-effective. Multiple epigenomic maps have already been produced for stem cells and primary tissues, and pipelines have been assembled for efficient data collection, processing and analysis. For the REMC project, we propose to apply ChlP-Seq and HTBS pipelines to generate comprehensive high-resolution maps of chromatin state and DNA methylation for 100 diverse cell types. Cell types were selected for their biological and medical importance, and for their potential to maximize the comprehensiveness of acquired epigenomic data. They include human ES cells, ES-derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells, reprogrammed stem cells and primary tissues. ChlP-Seq will be used to map highly informative chromatin modifications and related chromatin proteins in each cell type. HTBS will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps. Reference epigenomes will reveal the locations and activation states of diverse functional genomic elements, inform on the developmental state and potential of studied cell populations, and provide a framework for understanding complex epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. All data will be made available to the scientific community upon verification. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive characterization of epigenetic marks ('the epigenome') is a critical step towards a global understanding of the human genome in health and disease. The proposed mapping studies will provide unprecedented views of the human epigenetic landscape and its variation across cell states, offer fundamental insight into the functions and interrelationships of epigenetic marks, and provide a framework for future studies of normal and diseased epigenomes.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this proposal is to establish an integrated Center for creating high-quality reference maps of key epigenotypes in pluripotent, differentiating, and primary differentiated human cells and tissues. The Northwest Reference Epigenome Mapping Center aggregates leading experts in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) biology, lineage-specific differentiation of hESCs, and well-established differentiating and differentiated adult primary tissue systems to establish a substantial capacity for the production of purified cells and tissues for large-scale epigenomic studies. The Center integrates this capacity with an existing high-throughput genomics and informatics infrastructure operating at scale, creating unique synergies that enable genome-scale epigenetic analyses of high-value human primary and progenitor cell types. The Center will perform high-resolution, whole-genome profiling of foundational epigenotypes in project cell types including high-resolution quantification of chromatin structural remodeling, and analysis of DNA methylation at both actively remodeled and silenced regulatory DNA templates. The Center will also profile both small RNA species and conventional gene expression from all study cell types. The Center's informatics and analytical arm will manage project data and its release into consortium and public repositories, and will perform integrative analyses to elucidate the connection between major epigenotypes and dynamic cellular programming of gene expression.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique model system for investigating the mechanisms of human development due to their ability to replicate indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a host of functionally distinct cell types. In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs, and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells, we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm, trophoblast, mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages), and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome, and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically, we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages, and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis, and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting, storage, and distribution of epigenome maps. Finally, we will perform integrated data analysis to identify new epigenetic patterns in the genome that could provide insights in mechanisms of epigenetic regulation.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Chlorine gas (CI2) is a readily available chemical warfare agent that causes a dose-dependent toxicity to pulmonary and other mucosal tissues. The major toxicity of CI2 exposure is oxidative damage of lung tissues that is thought to be due to the direct effects of CI2 reaction products combined with inflammatory mediators released by lung-infiltrating leukocytes. This proposed mechanism has not been clearly demonstrated but raises the possibility that inhibition of pulmonary inflammation following CI2 exposure will reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality. Our laboratory has identified the cells and the cell migration events that lead to immune-mediated lung damage, morbidity, and mortality during viral and bacterial infections. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that a similar pattern of inflammation occurs after chlorine exposure. These findings suggest that chlorine-induced lung injury could be substantially lessened using a specific chemokine receptor antagonist. Importantly, a pharmacologic antagonist for the chemokine receptor we have identified has already been developed and proven to be safe and effective in early clinical trials for other indications. This raises the possibility that a drug already exists that would reduce the morbidity and mortality of chlorine exposure in humans. In a series of murine studies, we will determine the extent to which specific pulmonary inflammatory cell types contribute to chlorine-induced lung injury and the consequent epithelial damage, bronchial reactivity, morbidity, and mortality. We will then examine the ability of the chemokine receptor antagonist to reduce these toxicities. These studies will provide a basis for determining if trials of chemokine receptor antagonists should be considered in humans.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a randomized, controlled clinical trial, the Improving Function in AMD Trial {IFAMD), to test the efficacy of Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) to improve vision function in older persons with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a highly prevalent, disabling disease of aging that causes severe vision loss and functional decline. It is the leading cause of blindness in older persons in the United States and may affect more than 10 million people.  Currently, there are no effective treatments to restore vision. Thus, improving Vision Function is a major goal of treatment. Vision function refers to vision-related abilities to perform daily living activities (e.g. reading recipes to prepare meals). Decrements in vision function will become a major public health problem as the population ages and the prevalence of AMD increases.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] PST is a brief, standardized, cognitive-behavioral treatment that teaches problem-solving skills.  We believe PST will enable patients with AMD find practical solutions to vision-related problems and thereby improve vision function. We will recruit 240 AMD patients from the retina clinics of Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, with bilateral AMD and visual acuity worse than 20/70 in the better eye and no worse than 20/400 in the fellow eye. PST-trained nurses will deliver 6 1-hour, in-home sessions to the 120 subjects randomized to PST. The control treatment is Supportive Therapy (ST), a similarly structured, standardized psychological treatment that controls for the non-specific effects of treatment (n = 120). ST contains no active elements beyond its non-specific components; in this way it is a placebo treatment. Independent raters, masked to treatment assignment, will assess Targeted Vision Function (primary outcome) and vision-related quality of life (secondary outcome) at 3 months to assess PST's efficacy, and at 6 months to evaluate its long-term effects. As the population ages, the disability of AMD will become more prevalent, costly, and burdensome to patients, families, and ophthalmologists. This makes devising and testing practical and affordable interventions to improve vision function a national priority.  [unreadable]       [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a randomized, controlled clinical trial, the Low Vision Depression Prevention TriAL (VITAL), to test the efficacy of a low vision rehabilitative (LVR) intervention to prevent depressive disorders in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We have previously established that 30% of patients with AMD become depressed when they can no longer pursue valued goals. We propose an innovative intervention in which a low vision occupational therapist (OT) collaborates with a low vision optometrist to help patients to continue valued goals and thereby prevent depressive disorders. The OT will meet with subjects in their homes 6 times over 12 weeks, and use a problem-solving approach to facilitate device use training, home modifications, and compensatory strategies. Additionally, the OT will review subject progress with the optometrist 2 X during the intervention. We plan to recruit 200 subjects with subthreshold depressive symptoms and recent neovascular AMD (NVAMD) in one eye, who already have AMD in the fellow eye. Their recent bilateral vision loss and low level depressive symptoms increase their risk to develop more severe depressive disorders. We will randomize subjects to collaborative LVR (i.e., optometrist and OT) or enhanced LVR (i.e., optometrist and Supportive Therapy (ST)). In this study, usual LVR is \"enhanced\" with ST, which is a standardized placebo treatment that controls for attention. The primary aim of the VITAL Trial is to test the efficacy of the collaborative intervention to reduce the incidence of depressive disorders (primary outcome) at 4 months. The secondary aims are to: a) test the efficacy of the collaborative intervention to improve targeted vision function and vision-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) at 4 months; b) test the collaborative intervention\\'s long-term effect to prevent depressive disorders at 12 months; and c) test the collaborative intervention\\'s long-term effect on targeted vision function and vision-related quality of life at 12 months. We also propose exploratory aims to understand the mechanisms of the intervention\\'s effect and to estimate its cost and cost-effectiveness. AMD is the leading cause of blindness in older persons in the U.S., affects 10 million people, and is a growing public health problem as the population ages. In this context, the VITAL Trial has high clinical significance to patients with AMD, and wider public health significance as we confront the challenge of caring for older adults with chronic disabilities.

These drugs are increasingly effective in breast cancer, but which drug is best for each woman remains unclear. Our work in the first cycle of the Pharmacogenetics Research Network identified, through a series of laboratory and clinical studies, new genetic patterns that predict effects of the estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen. We now propose to build on these data to examine the influence of an extended series of candidate genes on the effects of the aromatase inhibitor class of drugs and to refine the genetic signatures that predict tamoxifen effects. Our work will involve the following broad specific aims: 1) To identify common genetic variants of the human estrogen receptors and important nuclear coactivators and repressers of these receptors using a combined bioinformatic and direct sequencing approach; 2) To test the hypothesis that these variants alter gene expression or function using in vitro assays; 3) To test the contribution of variants identified during specific aim 1 and 2 to tamoxifen response in the clinical trial of tamoxifen pharmacogenetics already conducted. 4) To characterize the involvement of genetically polymorphic drug metabolizing enzymes in the human metabolism of the available aromatase inhibitors: letrozole, exemestane and anastrozole in vitro. 5) To test the hypothesis that variants in candidate genes identified in aims 1-4 are associated with well curated phenotypic outcomes, including estrogen metabolite concentrations, pharmacokinetics, hot flashes, breast density, bone metabolism and serum lipid subfractions in breast cancer patients receiving anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. The results of this proposal will generate new information that, linked with our novel tamoxifen pharmacogenetics findings, will generate a series of genetic tools key to optimizing drug selection for women with breast cancer and to our understanding of the mechanisms of estrogen action.

However, there is clear evidence that medication responses, like most common diseases, are under the control of a network of genes, each contributing to the patient's phenotype. The CREATE Pharmacogenetic Research Network (Comprehensive Research on Expressed Alleles in Therapeutic Evaluation) was funded in August 2001 as one of 4 additions to the existing NIH Pharmacogenetics Research Network (PGRN). In the subsequent three short years, CREATE has made significant contributions to the PGRN goals of publicly available pharmacogenetic knowledge, shared computational and analytical resources, defining the common goals and needs for the field, and communicating PGRN findings to foster translation and application of pharmacogenetic knowledge. CREATE brought together infrastructure for the evaluation of pathways regulating drug activity. This was achieved through the coordinated efforts of investigators and staff from Washington University with expertise in the fields of Genomics, Pharmacogenetics, Clinical Pharmacology, Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, Statistical Genetics, Population Genetics, Developmental Pharmacology, and Translational Research. Together they will evaluate the following general aims to develop validation strategies for applied pharmacokinetics. General aims 1. Identify polymorphisms in members of pathways regulating drug activity 2. Evaluate novel approaches to pathway dissection 3. Validate and functionally assess drug pathway variants 4. Establish drug pathways in human development Supported by Administrative, Bioinformatic/Biostatistical, and Colecular Pathology Cores, these aims are being achieved using human gastrointestinal cancer as a model system, as it is a common cause of death, has no clear prognostic tools to guide therapy, has readily accessible tissue available in the Molecular Pathology Core, and is treated with a small number of medications.

In the first round of funding, we developed focus-stabilized TIRF FSM and spinning disk confocal imaging of actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion dynamics in tissue culture cells, and developed image analysis software that converts the stochastic speckle image signal into high- resolution maps of the assembly, disassembly, and transport of the actin filaments. We exploited the quantitative information delivered by this technology to study the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in migrating epithelial cells and thus established a new paradigm for how the cell builds specific actin-based structures to drive directed cell migration. Here, we seek to make the next critical steps towards our long term goal of establishing qFSM as a method for the comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics and interaction of multiple macromolecular structures in living cells. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: To extend qFSM to the measurement of absolute rates of polymer turnover which will allow us to perform in situ biochemistry of actin dynamics in living cells. Aim 2: To extend qFSM to the analysis of microtubule and intermediate filament cytoskeletons. Aim 3: To establish correlational qFSM to probe the dynamic interaction between two or more macromolecular structures in living cells. These developments are motivated by the hypothesis-driven cell biological research in our labs on the fundamental mechanisms of cytoskeletal function in cell migration, but our technology is implemented generically with an eye towards its broad use by the biomedical research community. We propose to further develop the technique of quantitative Fluorescent Speckle Microscopy for the analysis of the dynamics and interaction of macromolecular assemblies. Our studies will focus on the spatial and temporal integration of the dynamics of the actin filament, microtubule, and intermediate filament cytoskeleton systems. These interactions are centrally implicated in a wide array of cell functions.

It will focus on mathematical and computational methods for modelling exposure to pathogens and their products as well as the effectiveness and consequences of different intervention strategies.  In particular, it will explore the effects of human contact patterns in urban areas on disease transmission dynamics and the consequences of proposed early and mid-term responses to intentional or natural releases of pathogens.   The project will produce a simulation system tracking the transmission of multiple co-circulating and interacting diseases in a synthetic population.  Flexible user-specified scenarios will include such parameterized elements as: host-pathogen interactions; disease transmission dynamics; initial health state of the population; the mode of a pathogen's introduction into the population; and choice and scheduling of response strategies, which might be demographically and/or geographically targeted.  The simulation will rely on existing estimates of contact patterns in a synthetic urban population of 1.5 million individuals.

It will focus on mathematical and computational methods for modelling exposure to pathogens and their products as well as the effectiveness and consequences of different intervention strategies.  In particular, it will explore the effects of human contact patterns in urban areas on disease transmission dynamics and the consequences of proposed early and mid-term responses to intentional or natural releases of pathogens.   The project will produce a simulation system tracking the transmission of multiple co-circulating and interacting diseases in a synthetic population.  Flexible user-specified scenarios will include such parameterized elements as: host-pathogen interactions; disease transmission dynamics; initial health state of the population; the mode of a pathogen's introduction into the population; and choice and scheduling of response strategies, which might be demographically and/or geographically targeted.  The simulation will rely on existing estimates of contact patterns in a synthetic urban population of 1.5 million individuals.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RTI International* (RTI) proposes to team with IBM, SAS, and Emory and Duke Universities to serve as the Informatics Group (IG) for the \"Pilot Projects for Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS)\" as specified in RFA-GM-03-008.  The IG will provide access to a wide array of data sources and models, provide computational and analytic tools, create simulations and develop statistical tests, and enable non-MIDAS users access to models through user-friendly interfaces, publicly available data, and reports.  RTI envisions a dynamic, state-of-the-art web-portal with continually evolving models, accruing data sources, and documentation of findings.  Informatics and analytic tools will be continually expanding to accommodate new data types and modeling requests.  Analytic and data needs will evolve as models are used to test new options in public health response or to model emerging infections.  RTI fully appreciates the additional requirements of enhanced computing capabilities, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week monitoring of the web site, and ability to respond rapidly and effectively to health security situations.  We propose to host a beta-testing site for other infectious disease models and informatics tools on the portal.  We have assembled an IG team with expertise that addresses the scientific and technical requirements.  The proposed Principal Investigator Dr. Wagener and Co-Principal Investigators Dr. Cuticchia and Mr. Cooley bring a combined experience that encompasses infectious disease modeling, informatics, genetics, public health, and informatics technology.  The IG team will be substantially enhanced with the computing capacity and information technology expertise of IBM and informatics tools and solutions of SAS.  Their efforts will be supported by a project manager and an advisory group spanning infectious disease, public health, biomathematics, and informatics expertise.  With a large scientific and technical staff of a wide range of expertise to draw upon, RTI has experience using and analyzing data from health, environmental, social, agricultural, and biologic domains.  Having over 30 years experience coordinating multisite studies, providing technology innovations and addressing public health issues, RTI is well equipped to assume the role of the IG and to help the National Institute of General Medical Sciences accomplish this expanded mission.',\n",

The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.

Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a new application in response to RFA-GM-04-002, for which the proposed work should help move toward the long-term goal of selection of antihypertensive drug therapy based on a patient's genetic make-up. Hypertension (HTN) is the most common chronic disease for which drugs are prescribed, and the most prevalent risk factor for heart attack, stroke, renal failure and heart failure. Responses to antihypertensive drug therapy exhibit considerable interpatient variability, contributing to poor rates of HTN control (currently 34% in the US), and frequent nonadherence and dropout from therapy. We propose to identify genetic predictors of the antihypertensive and adverse metabolic responses to two preferred and pharmacodynamically contrasting drugs, a [unreadable]-blocker (atenolol) and a thiazide diuretic (HCTZ) given initially as monotherapy, and subsequently in combination, to 800 individuals with uncomplicated hypertension. High quality phenotype data, including both home and ambulatory measures of blood pressure (BP) response, and lipid and insulin sensitivity measures of adverse metabolic responses will be related to genetic variation through two approaches. First, testing 7 SNPs in each of 70 candidate genes, we will examine the influence of these genes' variation on responses to p-blockers and diuretics (Specific Aim 1). This will include assessment of genetic associations with: antihypertensive responses to monotherapy (Aim 1a), addition of a second drug to monotherapy (Aim 1b), and combination therapy (Aim 1c); and adverse metabolic responses to mono and combination therapy (Aim Id). This candidate gene approach will be supplemented by discovery of novel genes involved in variable BP and metabolic responses to p-blockers and diuretics through testing of 20,000 pututative functional SNPs that span the human genome (Specific Aim 2). As in Aim 1, Aim 2 will include testing for associations with antihypertensive and adverse metabolic responses to monotherapy and combination therapy. The proposed research will substantially increase our understanding of the pharmacogenetics of mono- and combination antihypertensive drug therapy. It will also lead to creation of data sets and samples that can be used by others in the field, through deposit of data to PharmGKB, and creation of immortalized cell lines from all study participants to share data and biological samples with other researchers. The proposed research is significant because genetically-targeted antihypertensive therapy could lead to dramatically higher response rates and fewer adverse effects than the usual trial-and-error approach. This would likely lead to higher rates of HTN control, less need for polypharmacy, reduced health care costs, and improved outcomes. The proposed efforts will be enhanced through conduct within the Pharmacogenetics Research Network, and availability of data and biological samples will be beneficial to other investigators in the field.

       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to dissect the genetic determinants of individual variation in response to medications used routinely for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).  Projects will be performed by an established multidisciplinary group that has a track record of publication and productivity, collegial interactions with outside groups, including other NIH funded multi-center networks, and a history of data sharing. Project 1: Pharmacogenomics of anti-platelet agents for CVD prevention: This project seeks to identify specific gene variants that predict response to clopidogrel (Plavix) for the 1 degree and 2 degree prevention of CV events. We will build upon our large ongoing HAPI Heart Study in which 1,000 related Old Order Amish subjects, all of whom have been extensively characterized with respect to CVD (including response to aspirin) and in whom an 800 short tandem repeat marker genome scan has been completed. We propose to treat these same subjects with clopidogrel and to obtain measures of platelet aggregation and function. We will (1) determine the frequency and heritability of clopidogrel response and the relationship between clopidogrel resistance and aspirin resistance; (2) exhaustively define sequence variation and haplotype structure of 100 candidate genes and perform linkage and association analysis of SNPs/haplotypes with platelet function phenotypes; and (3) perform genome-wide linkage analysis to identify chromosome regions (and ultimately genes) linked to clopidogrel response. The proposed studies will provide important insights into clopidogrel and TZD response, will have important implications for the prevention and treatment of CVD in millions of Americans.

       " 'We shall develop an evidence-based hierarchical family of paradigmatic model frameworks for the temporal and spatial spread of two directly transmitted infections of farm animals: Avian Influenza (Al) and Foot and Mouth Disease(FMD. With respect to modeling disease systems we shall create both local (within herd/flock), county, state and national models of Al and FMD. The heirarchical strategy is important because the simpler models can be completed more quickly and parameterized more readily and are therefore more likely to be available for use than the more complicated models. Their behavior can more easily be generalized to other systems and can inform response measures in a strategic (if not tactical) sense. The more complicated models are essential tactical instruments but will take longer to complete and their behavior may not be so easily generalized to other infections. Our proposal represents a compromise between the need to provide useful strategic information about a range of potential threats - and the requirement that we can inform tactical decisions about prevention, response and recovery. Among other things, we shall investigate the appropriate level of granularity (scale) for each of these models. There are few regions in the USA where farms locations are mapped to level of detail required for most existing types of models for spatial and temporal spread at state or national scales. We shall devise models (metapopulation/ Patch/ Gravity models) based on other spatial resolutions (eg data based on zip codes, counties, or a national grid system). We shall test and calibrate these approximations using detailed spatial stochastic models developed using detailed and extensive GIS data bases on farm location in Pennsylvania and then extend their use to other regions in the USA. We shall use the models to devise and refine strategies for prevention, response and recovery. Avian Influenza and Foot and Mouth Disease are potential agents of bio/agroterrorism in addition to being devastating animal epidemic diseases in their own right which have have dramatic adverse effects on the well-being (social, economic and psycholgical) of human populations. The models proposed here will assist in planning strategies for prevention, control and response. In the case of Avian Influenza especially, controlling the infection in birds is a pre-emptive strategy for control in people.',\n",

       " 'We develop predictive computational models for three problems in pathogen evolution.  First, we use computational chemistry to analyze the evolutionary changes in molecular shape and charge that recurred during multiple zoonotic transfers of influenza A from birds to humans. The repeated evolutionary patterns from past zoonotic transfers provide the basis for computational models that predict the risk of future pandemic strains. Our computational models will be useful for screening viruses sampled during surveillance of recurring human outbreaks of influenza derived from avian hosts.  Second, we develop computational models to predict the efficacy of alternative vaccination strategies when vaccinating repeatedly against a rapidly evolving pathogen. Smith et al. et al. recently suggested that repeat vaccination should avoid cross reactivity with past vaccines and, at the same time, target predicted epidemic strains of the pathogen. We extend this idea by using our previously developed method for predicting influenza evolution based on patterns of positive selection. We use existing influenza data and computational methods to test the hypothesis that improved vaccine efficacy can be achieved by vaccinating with the influenza strain that we predict will dominate a few epidemics into the future. We will also develop an expanded computational model to analyze vaccination strategies for other rapidly evolving pathogens.  Third, we construct mathematical and computer models to study the conditions that maintain co-circulating pathogen strains and the conditions that favor one strain to replace another. We will evaluate whether interference competition between strains mediated by cross-reactive host immunity can explain the observed patterns of fluctuating influenza strains. Based on our influenza work, we will extend our models to other pathogens to predict when new strains may arise and outcompete current strains.  Finally, we will collate and make publicly available nucleotide sequence and antigenicity data for influenza from the unpublished CDC and WHO archives. This research will help to identify emerging pathogen strains that pose significant risk of causing widespread human pandemics. This research will also expand the range of vaccination strategies for use against rapidly evolving pathogens such as influenza.',\n",
       " 'A major challenge for contemporary biology is to progress from the analysis of single components or even entire pathways involved in cellular and developmental processes to the study of higher order regulatory networks. Such a systems level analysis requires the convergence of classical genetics and embryology with more recent genomic and computational methods. The goal of this project is to elaborate an integrated experimental strategy for dissecting the structure and function of transcriptional regulatory networks that direct the expression of batteries of developmentally related genes in particular embryonic cells. Body wall muscle development in the Drosophila embryo will be used as a model system since the cell types involved are well-characterized and since both extensive information and genetic resources are available for individual myogenic pathways in this organism. Three specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1, embryonic myoblasts expressing a fluorescent protein will be purified by flow cytometry from wild-type embryos and from embryos in which myogenesis is variably perturbed, RNA from isolated cells will be subjected to transcriptional profiling using DNA microarrays, co-expressed genes will be predicted from a meta-analysis of the profiling dataset compendium, and expression patterns will be validated at single cell resolution by embryo in situ hybridization. In Aim 2, the DNA binding specificities of myoblast transcription factors (TFs) newly identified in the profiling experiments will be determined using a protein binding microarray technology. The derived TF binding sites[unreadable]along with sequence motifs already known to function in muscle-specific enhancers[unreadable]will be input to a novel computational framework that both predicts candidate cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) and assesses the likelihood that a given combination of TFs regulates a particular set of co-expressed genes. The algorithm to be employed incorporates a statistical consideration of TF binding site clustering, interspecies sequence conservation, relevant gene expression data, and a systematic examination of TF combinatorics. Scans for additional shared sequence motifs will be performed on predicted CRMs, and CRMs will be classified based on overall motif composition such that each class represents a potentially unique transcriptional code. In Aim 3, representative examples of each motif and members of each CRM class will be tested for transcriptional activity in transgenic reporter assays. In addition, both appropriate mutants and a rapid, whole embryo RNA interference assay will be used to selectively perturb the derived network in order to assess the functions of novel regulatory components. Collectively, these studies integrate computational and empirical approaches in a manner that establishes a comprehensive experimental paradigm with broad applicability to many developmental systems. Moreover, these investigations provide a knowledge base that will both advance a molecular understanding of human birth defects and inform rational approaches to tissue engineering as a therapeutic modality.',\n",
       " \"Early detection- of bioterrorism and infectious disease outbreaks caused by emerging pathogens is very important for public health, to allow prompt implementation of control measures. Routinely collected, automated health services data, including microbiology laboratory tests, ambulatory care and emergency department visits, hospitalizations, diagnostic tests, and prescription drug data could potentially be very useful for disease outbreak detection. However, mathematical, computational and statistical models are needed to implement such systems whenever the outcomes under surveillance already exist at some baseline level that does not require action. For example, if appropriate signal detection methods were available, identification of an anthrax bioterrorism attack might be accelerated through recognition of an unusual number of patients seeking care for cough and fever.; In this project, we will develop models for the early detection of infectious disease outbreaks and for monitoring an outbreak after it has been detected. This includes (i) models describing the natural temporal and geographical variation in the number of people utilizing the health services of interest, in order to adjust for e.g. seasonal and day-of-week effects and (ii) different space-time aberration detection models that will generate a signal when an outbreak have occurred. These models will be applied at different geographical scales, from individual wards of a single hospital to a whole country, as well as for different data specificity from very general symptoms such as fever to specific microbial disease strains and antimicrobial resistance profiles that migrate from one bacterial species to another. We will develop and test our new methods and models in two health plans (Harvard Pilgrim Health Care in Massachusetts, and Kaiser Permanente Northern California) that cover over 4 million people, a single large US referral hospital (Brigham and Women's), a statewide (Massachusetts) registry of MRSA, and a national (Argentine) consortium of 55 hospitals that monitors antibiotic resistance. The models and methods will be evaluated using both historical data from these health systems and simulated data based on different infectious disease transmission dynamics models.\",\n",

The specific aims of our proposal are the development of: efficient experimental designs for genome-wide association studies; novel and powerful statistical methods for genome-wide multi-marker association testing; methodology for the detection of interacting disease genes; and analysis tools for the joint analysis of multiple related genome wide scans. Key tools in this work will be the use of coalescent and population genetics approaches, incorporation of newly available fine-scale genetic maps for the human genome, and the exploitation of recent developments in computationally intensive statistical methods, notably in a missing data framework.  We plan to integrate existing and new methodology into a comprehensive suite of analysis software which will be made publicly available. We envisage working closely on all aspects of this project with other research groups funded as part of the proposed consortium. We would bring to this consortium the data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, a major UK-based genome-wide association study of 2000 cases and 3000 controls for each of eight common human diseases, together with considerable experience with that data and that from the International HapMap project.  The research outlined in this proposal will lead to efficient and practicable studies of human genetic disease.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One critical need for the development of reliable docking and scoring (d/s) is a large dataset containing high quality experimental protein-ligand complex structures, together with accurate binding affinity data. An online d/s resource (d/sResource) will be created by taking advantage of the PIs extensive expertise in this area and through community participation. SA1 will build the largest, freely accessible database of protein-ligand complexes with experimentally determined binding affinities from literature. This new resource will build off of the two largest protein-ligand datasets in existence: Wang's PDBbind and Carlson's Binding MOAD. SA2 will generate new experimental data. The lack of consistency between binding affinity data generated from different research groups and using different experimental techniques/conditions is another major hurdle. To address this deficiency, dissociation constants (Kds) for selected protein-ligand complexes will be determined using two complementary techniques: isothermal calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance. Furthermore, important physicochemical properties for the ligands will be determined (logP/logD, pKa, and solubility), and additional crystal structures will be solved. SA3 will curate data from the community. Deposition of large datasets will be requested from pharma, the NIH, and academia. This Aim includes solving partially completed crystal structures deposited into the d/sResource and analysis of deposited data for diversity/similarity across the ligands and proteins to prioritize for further experimental investigation in SA2. SA4 outlines the proposed community outreach. The d/sResource will not be a Michigan-only endeavor. Data will be deposited in many repositories: structures into the PDB, ITC data into BindingDB, and chemical information into Pubchem and NIST databases. Collaborations will be sought with other groups. Contests and meetings for d/s will be held, and a Visiting Scholars Program will be established to encourage new developments and facilitate the sharing of resources.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The project will provide a unique resource that is needed to improve in the field of structure-based drug design. Better techniques will save time and money in the development of new treatments, ultimately providing new drugs more quickly and at less expense to the greater population.

The Specific Aims are: I-a: To determine whether weaning to a hydrolysed casein formula (Nutramigen(tm)) reduces the frequency of diabetes-predictive autoantibodies, and I-b: To determine whether weaning to casein hydrolysate reduces the frequency of clinical diabetes. This double blind, randomized controlled trial in subjects with an affected first degree relative and risk-associated HLA genotypes, requires 2032 eligible infants: 4516 newborn babies need to be recruited, 45% of which will have eligible HLA genotypes (45.2% to date). An international, multicenter consortium has been developed comprising 73 centers in 15 countries. By the end of January'05 we achieved 65% of the recruitment target with 3187 infants registered, 2775 randomized and 1186 eligible infants entered into the intervention . The 6-8 month intervention is designed to compare the effects of either hydrolysed casein or standard cow milk based weaning formula. Duration of breast feeding is at the mothers' discretion. Recruitment and intervention will be completed by the second year of this proposal for trial continuation. All subjects are followed during and after the intervention period for 10 years with measurements of serological markers of intact cow milk exposure, diabetes predictive autoantibodies (the end point at age 6 years) and the clinical and/or metabolic indices of diabetes (the end point at age 10 years). A large, cross-linked repository of stored sera, DNA and cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells allows independently funded ancillary and mechanistic studies related to the natural history of prediabetes and the hypothesis to be tested. Cow milk protein is the most common intact foreign weaning protein in humans. If our intervention is effective in delaying autoimmunity or its progression to diabetes, this first ever primary prevention study of T1D, will have far-reaching impact for individuals and the global society.

The state of Florida has been significantly affected by the AIDS epidemic, especially among its teenagers living on the southeast coast of the state, particularly in Broward and Miami-Dade counties. Consequently, the primary objective of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Unit in Fort Lauderdale Florida, which serves all of Broward County, is to collaborate with the ATMof the National Institutes of Health so that HIV infected and at risk youth living in this community may participate in selected behavioral and community based translational, prophylactic, therapeutic, and vaccine trials which may someday help to eradicate HIV infection among adolescents in the United States and throughout the world. In Broward County, the youth participating in the ATN protocols have identified this initiative as the \"Planning Our World Jhrough Education and Research (POWER)Youth Project.\" The specific aim of the POWER Youth Project is to expand outreach to adolescents throughout the community, especially those at high risk for HIV, in order to bring as many youth as possible into care and to provide an opportunity for these youth to participate in research. The POWER Youth Project, in collaboration with the adolescent team of the Comprehensive Family AIDS Project (CFAP) (Ryan White, Title IV) in Fort Lauderdale, will expand its outreach efforts by focusing on innovative methods of recruitment and retention of hard to reach youth, including those who are homeless, substance abusing, truant and others at very high risk for HIV infection.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost all (99%) of maternal, neonatal, infant and child deaths arise in low and middle income countries, yet most research is focused on the 1% of deaths that occur in high income countries. There is a need to identify feasible and cost-effective evidence-based interventions applicable in low income and middle income countries, as well as strategies for scaling-up these interventions. The Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research (GN) is best suited to face that challenge. Our main specific aim is to develop and implement common protocols of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) sponsored by the GN. The consortium between Tulane University and the Institute for Clinical Effectiveness and Health Policy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, has extensive experience in conducting large, collaborative RCTs in Latin America and around the world, including a successful and productive participation in the GN first cycle. We have implemented one cluster RCT in 19 hospitals in six cities of Argentina and Uruguay, one cluster RCT in 16 communities in two provinces of Argentina, and one multicentric survey in 1,523 pregnant women in both countries. As an illustration of the protocols we are planning to develop, we are proposing a cluster RCT to test an intervention to increase the use of antenatal corticosteroids in developing countries to prevent neonatal deaths. The administration of antenatal corticosteroids to babies at high risk of preterm birth is the most powerful antenatal intervention to reduce neonatal mortality, reducing neonatal deaths between 25%- 50%. However, in low and middle income countries, only 10% of preterm babies are currently receiving this form of care. We propose to conduct a cluster RCT among 30 communities in 6-8 GN countries. The intervention will determine if we can increase the use of antenatal corticosteroids and reduce neonatal mortality and will consist of implementing the following strategies at all health care levels at intervention settings: 1) diffusing guidelines to healthcare providers; 2) improving the identification of women needing corticosteroids by measuring uterine height with a color-coded tape to estimate gestational age in women with signs of labor; and 3) providing antenatal corticosteroids kits containing corticosteroids Uniject devices and instructions for administration. This research could have a large impact on neonatal mortality in low and middle income countries and is thus highly relevant to public health.

The success of these intervention studies will facilitate better clinical and behavioral management for HIV infected youth as well as make a significant contribution to the prevention of further HIV infection among youth. The AAP is uniquely positioned to meet these goals both through its research and clinical experience as well as its population of HIV positive and at-risk youth who reside in the Bronx, New York. In 2004, the AAP cared for101 HIV+ youth (60% of whom are females and 98% of whom are ethnic/racial minorities). The heavy burden of HIV faced by Bronx residents and youth necessitates continued research to develop more effective approaches to prevention, case finding and care. As the borough with the highest rates of poverty, the health status of the 1.3 million Bronx residents continues to lag behind other residents of New York City. The Bronx has more people living with HIV/AIDS than 45 states. This research will help the AAP to address the public health issue of HIV/AIDS in the Bronx.      [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",
       " \"The long-term objective of this proposal is to sustain the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network (ATN) under a cooperative agreement. This network will have the capacity for developing and conducting selected behavioral, community-based translational, prophylactic, therapeutic, and vaccine trials based on and adding to the information developed through the Adolescent Medicine HIV/AIDS Network (1994-2001) and the current Adolescent Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (2001-2006). The primary mission of the ATN for HIV/AIDS Interventions will be to conduct research, both independently and in collaboration with existing research networks and individual investigators, in HIV-infected and HIV-at-risk pre-adolescents, adolescents, and young adults up to age 25 years. The ATN will bring expertise and resources to collaborative protocol development that will ensure feasible and acceptable study design as well as experience in recruiting and retaining this unique population. This network will design, develop, and conduct multiple common clinical trials as well as pertinent formative and translational research studies collaboratively or independently when needed.  The ATN is the first clinical research infrastructure to address the particular challenges and unique clinical management demands of HIV-infected adolescents and the prevention needs of at-risk youth through common protocols. All HIV-infected youth are faced with social and physical developmental challenges of puberty that make coming to terms with chronic illness, complex drug regimens, and disclosure to peers an intensely more complicated endeavor.  An estimated 11.8 million young people aged 15 to 24 are living with HIV/AIDS worldwide and each day another 6,000 young people are newly infected. In the US, the rate in youth remains among the highest. The ATN's current agenda needs to be sustained and expanded to meet the emerging needs of this population. Primary prevention studies will focus on efforts to interrupt HIV transmission in uninfected populations. Secondary prevention studies examine ways to preserve health in HIV-infected populations. Tertiary prevention studies are needed to restore ill HIV-positive youth to full or better function.\",\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for the re-competition of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Unit in San Francisco, a collaboration between the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and Larkin Street Youth services (LSYS). San Francisco targets the key vulnerable populations outlined in the RFA: runaway homeless, substance abusing and minority youth, as well as transgender youth. Our aims remain to continue outreach to vulnerable youth both HIV infected and uninfected at risk and to engage them safely in clinical and behavioral research. We aim to continue creating a strong infrastructure for performing HIV vaccine trials in the future. We believe we contributed to the overall strength and breadth of the ATM and meet the expectations for renewal. Our site is an ATU centered in the community rather than the university; bringing university expertise in partnership to the community. Our primary clinical population of HIV positive youth receives medical care at Larkin Street Youth Services' (LSYS) community clinic, and we now have engaged more than 14 other community sites in recruitment and referrals into ATN studies. As of March 1, 2005 we have recruited 77 subjects into currently open clinical and prevention protocols at our site (021,022, 023B,024, 025, and 0168), have participated in several protocol development teams (015, 016B, 034, 039 and PACTG 1046), and a member of our staff was lead author on the first paper to be completed about Connect to Protect. UCSF Division of Adolescent Medicine is a rich resource for adolescent medicine research and clinical services to youth. The ATU at SF team includes the PI, Dr. Moscicki, our Connect to Protect (C2P)team members Catherine Geanuracos, LCSW, Kevin Sniecinski, and Dr. Colette Auerswald, Study Coordinators Bethany Certa, RN, BSN and J.B. Molaghan ANP-C, and staff assistant Nigel Reyes. At LSYS, Alan Taggart, M.D., has served HIV infected and uninfected youth at Larkin Street Youth for over nine years. He and Heather Weisbrod, the outreach worker, have effectively identified, screened and recruited homeless youth into trials. Our clinic services include LSYS, which has a comprehensive, youth centered, culturally appropriate model of HIV care, and, at UCSF, the Positive Health Practices and Pediatrics AIDS Program. In summary, our ATU site is a unique partnership between the university and the community. During the last 5 years, we have solidified our commitment to ensure marginalized and vulnerable youths' right to participate in research. The Connect to Protect project has expanded our involvement with the community and has brought additional agencies into our referral network. We believe it is critical to continue to engage the high risk youth in the San Francisco Bay Area in clinical and behavioral research.      [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",
       " \"AIM I.The Chicago ATU will continue to expand its capacity for participating in the current Adolescent  Trials Network (ATM)for HIV/AIDS Interventions and in ATN's process of developing and conducting new  behavioral, community-based and hospital based, prevention, therapeutic, and vaccine trials  AIM 2. The Chicago ATU's HIV-experienced, multidisciplinary clinical staff will be responsible for ATN  subject recruitment, retention, and safety in conjunction with our wide array of adolescent-specific services  in our well established adolescent HIV care program.  AIM 3. The Chicago ATU will enroll and monitor subjects in a central database, continuously monitor its  managerial capacity for conducting research protocols and reporting on protocol implementation, protocol  data collection, and submission via continuous quality assurance of these capabilities by key personnel.  The Chicago Adolescent Trials Network Unit, which operates as a part of the Division of Adolescent  Medicine, Dept of Pediatrics at Stroger Hospital (JSH), has an HIV positive adolescent care specific clinic at  the CORE Center. JSH is the main public health safety net provider for Chicago. The CORE Center is the  largest free standing clinic dedicated to the treatment and research into HIV and other infectious diseases in  the United States. It operates on well-delineated principles of cultural competency, with population-specific  clinics and resources dedicated to adolescents. The resources include adolescent-medicine trained  physicians and nurse practitioners, with clinic space specifically designed for the population. The clinic  currently has 170 youth between the ages of 13 and 24 in care. It is the largest adolescent HIV clinic in  Illinois. Demographically, these youth are 85% African American, 9% Latino, 4% Caucasian and 2% Other.  By gender: 65% male and 35% female. Of the 170 patients in our clinic, 86 are currently enrolled in ATN  protocols. These 86 represent 111 enrollments. Our current rate of retention in studies is 93%. ATN in  Chicago employs four well characterized outreach techniques to identify youth and engage them in care: a  targeted, social marketing technique; drawing from 4 school based clinics which have 10,000 visits/yr; a  community based outreach program; and drawing youth from our general adolescent clinic.  Relevance: The ATN in Chicago will provide HIV positive and high-risk negative youth with the  opportunity to participate in youth-specific, youth-relevant trials of cutting edge therapies and therapeutic  strategies for HIV with the support required by their age group. It will also provide the field with  opportunities to perform research on important behavioral and prevention strategies in the very high risk  adolescent population.\",\n",
       " 'The Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATM) was formed in response to the needs of the unabated domestic HIV epidemic in youth. The Adolescent Medicine Leadership Group (AMLG) and ATM Coordinating Center (ACC) described in this application propose to continue to build on their scientific, administrative and experiential leadership in the ATM and together with the site personnel develop and implement the scientific agenda of the ATN for this next project period. The scientific and administrative leadership proposed here will continue to work toward maximizing quality, efficiency and productivity while incorporating responsiveness, flexibility, transparency and innovation in their work. Additionally, the ATN as a whole will continue to nurture and expand the collaborations that were established in the first project period with other federally funded networks and programs. The proposed ACC will continue its pivotal facilitating role in the functioning of the ATN. The AMLG is proposed to initiate this project period with three distinct scientific leadership groups, the Behavioral (BLG), Community Prevention (CPLG) and Therapeutic Leadership Groups (TLG), with complimentary expertise both within and across groups to provide the multidisciplinary approach needed to address issues in the populations of focus. The BLG will focus its agenda on both perinatally and behaviorally HIV infected youth and have identifed the following key areas for interventions: mental health, secondary prevention and risk reduction, needs of youth engaging in care including those acutely infected, and medication adherence. The CPLG will focus on continued development of a community based primary prevention infrastructure and interventions including biological interventions such as vaccines or microbicides. The agenda of the TLG uses a theoretical framework to identify key elements and approaches for an adolescent specific agenda for both perinatally and behaviorally infected youth. The scientific agenda of the leadership groups will be continually reviewed in the context of future developments and a flexible, adaptive approach to address new needs will continue to be a priority. The ATN as a whole remains the only federally funded network focused solely on the complex needs and issues of the HIV infected and at-risk youth at the epicenter of the domestic HIV epidemic.',\n",
       " 'Despite the advances that have been made in the prevention and treatment of HIV infection, the numbers of cases seen in adolescents and young adults have failed to decrease significantly. This is the result of a steady influx of new cases, the relative clinical stability of established cases, and the emergence of a new cohort of adolescents who had acquired HIV infection perinatally. Research involving HIV infected adolescents is crucial to decreasing overall numbers of cases and improving the health and wellbeing of those already living with HIV infection.  The Adolescent Trials Network (ATN) for HIV/AIDS Interventions is the first clinical research structure to address the challenges and clinical management demands of HIV infected youth and the prevention needs of their uninfected counterparts. This has been achieved by creating a network of clinical sites throughout the country which has promoted this important research agenda nationally and locally. The ATN has extended the knowledge gained through previous observational research studies and has established interventions that have benefited adolescents with HIV infection. ATN has also established a community based protocol know as \"Connect-to- Protect\" (G2P) to actively prevent new HIV infections in adolescents.  This proposal seeks support for our program for HIV infected adolescents, the Burgess Clinic at Children\\'s National Medical Center, to continue its participation as a clinical site for the renewal of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network (ATN). The focus of its efforts will be on advancing the knowledge on primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention initiatives. Support for our participation is requested on the basis of a longstanding commitment to care, advocacy, research and education by a well-developed, mature, multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, psychologists, social workers and case managers. We have cared for over 300 HIV infected teenagers and been a part of virtually all of the important research initiatives involving this age group. It is our aim to continue to participate as an Adolescent Trials Unit (ATU) within the Network and by doing so to continue and expand our commitment to these patients.',\n",

STAR TRACK is the only adolescent exclusive HIV service in the state of Maryland and has a comprehensive \"one stop shopping\" model of care, a state wide community outreach program, an HIV early identification program through an adolescent specific HIV counseling and testing unit, and a community researcher partnership Connect to Protect Baltimore. Our program has been one of 15 sites of the Adolescent HIV/AIDS Research Network (AMHARN) from 1994-2000 and the Adolescent Trials Network (ATN) from 2001 to present with a successful track record of recruitment, retention, site performance and quality assurance. At the present time, the ATN UMB unit is ranked first in recruitment out of the other 15 units nationally. Our PI, study coordinators, research assistants, and Youth Community Advisory Board member have productively participated in and contributed towards the ATN mission and its goals. Our program has extensive experience in the recruitment and retention of HIV+ and HIV- adolescents, in clinical care and research, has a caseload of 110 HFV+ youths (30 of who are in transition to adult care) and approximately 3,000 HIV-youths. STARTRACK has strong clinical and research collaborations with the two other UMB HIV clinics for adults and pediatric patients for a total of 228 active HIV infected young people under the age of 24 many of whom have research experience. Our program has highly experienced adolescent researchers and study coordinators as well as basic and clinical researchers of the Division of Pediatric Immunology and the Institute of Human Virology of the University of Maryland. These investigators have an extensive track record of leadership in multi center collaborative trials and have made significant contributions to the ATN research agenda by developing protocols and contributing in many ways to the research agenda. The tight interface between community outreach, early identification of HIV, linkage to care and research, and comprehensive primary and sub specialty care, intrinsic to STAR TRACK\\'S structure, facilitates the major goals of the ATN. These relationships also provide a great structure to expand subject recruitment. This application details the current clinical and research capacity of the Adolescent Medicine Trial Unit (AMTU) at the University of Maryland to conduct research protocols related to the primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of HIV. High-risk populations available for this research include high-risk sexual minority and heterosexual youths, as well as ethnic minority and substance abusing youths. In addition, it includes youths in transitional housing situations and school dropouts. Furthermore, the strong collaboration with an experienced laboratory, database manager and other University of Maryland scientists with expertise in HIV clinical trials and vaccine development provides an optimal environment for enriching the basic science and laboratory-based agenda of the ATN.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Together with lack of exclusive breastfeeding, inadequate or/and inappropriate complementary feeding is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Use of unfortified plant-based complementary foods, even prepared optimally, cannot meet the needs for certain 'problem' micronutrients. Of special importance are iron and zinc, requirements for which can only be attained from unfortified foods if meat/liver are provided on a regular basis from the age of 6 mo. The broad goal of this proposal is to determine the multicultural potential of a non-fortified food-based approach (with continued breastfeeding), to achieve a nutritionally complete diet between 6-18 mo of age, especially during the challenging transition period from 6-9 mo. The key goal of our strategy will be to specifically encourage the regular feeding of meat/liver from 6 mo of age. The two hypotheses include: 1) that regular intake of meat/liver can be initiated at 6 mo and subsequently sustained; and 2) that the early introduction of meat/liver will be associated with significantly greater intake and improved status of iron and zinc, enhanced physical growth, improved neurocognitive development, and reduced infectious disease morbidity. Participants (n = 410) will be randomized by clusters to receive repetitive educational messages based on national/WHO complementary feeding guidelines (controls) or these guidelines plus messages regarding regular feeding of meat/liver from 6 mo onwards (test). Specific messages will be based on results of initial formative research which will incorporate principles of behavioral change communication (BCC). For the participants in the test clusters, additional messages developed from outcomes of formative research, will focus on the identification of affordable sources of meat/liver and offering these as regular complementary foods. Dissemination of the messages and training will be via local community health services, supported by lay counselors identified on the positive deviance model, to support behavioral change of caregivers. The primary functional outcome of the intervention will be linear growth from 6-18 mo; secondary outcomes include performance on neurocognitive testing and incidence of diarrhea and lower respiratory infection. A positive multi-country outcome of this trial will demonstrate the broad effectiveness of a BCC education model for achieving a local, food-based approach for adequate complementary feeding.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Pelvic floor disorders, such as urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and fecal incontinence, are common and significant health-related problems for women in the United States. Outcomes following surgical and non-surgical intervention for pelvic floor disorders have not been adequately evaluated. As a result, data necessary to fully inform patients and to make important policy decisions are unavailable. The long-term objective of the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN) is to systematically evaluate these outcomes. This application to be the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the pelvic floor disorders network brings together experienced investigators from biostatistics, urogynecology, urology, quality of life and health services research to prospectively assess the outcomes from various surgical interventions for female pelvic floor disorders. The specific aims of the DCC are to: 1. Assist in protocol development by providing expertise in the design, conduct and analysis of clinical trials conducted by the PFDN. 2. Provide expertise in measurement of quality of life and in the selection of the appropriate instruments to assess treatment outcomes and, when appropriate, to perform the interviews. 3. Coordinate the implementation of the study protocols approved by the Steering Committee, including design of the case report forms and interviewing protocols, development of a manual of operations, centralized database management with either centralized or remote data entry, submission of an IND to the FDA when necessary, and by organizing training and certification sessions, as needed. 4. Establish a database for each study conducted by the PFDN. 5. Implement either centralized or web-based data entry and verification. 6. Monitor the clinical sites with respect to data quality. 7. Provide infrastructure for monitoring adverse events and regulatory oversight for the network. 8. Provide logistical support for the Steering Committee, Advisory Board and DSMB, for both face-to-face meetings and teleconferences. 9. Maintain a website for the PFDN that includes web pages with content for the public, and a password- protected site with all study documentation and databases. 10. Manage and distribute protocol funds to the Clinical Centers. To illustrate the work of the DCC, a randomized clinical trial is proposed to compare surgical procedures for pelvic organ prolapse using a vaginal approach.

The Specific Aims are: I-a: To determine whether weaning to a hydrolysed casein formula (Nutramigen(tm)) reduces the frequency of diabetes-predictive autoantibodies, and I-b: To determine whether weaning to casein hydrolysate reduces the frequency of clinical diabetes. This double blind, randomized controlled trial in subjects with an affected first degree relative and risk-associated HLA genotypes, requires 2032 eligible infants: 4516 newborn babies need to be recruited, 45% of which will have eligible HLA genotypes (45.2% to date). An international, multicenter consortium has been developed comprising 73 centers in 15 countries. By the end of January'05 we achieved 65% of the recruitment target with 3187 infants registered, 2775 randomized and 1186 eligible infants entered into the intervention . The 6-8 month intervention is designed to compare the effects of either hydrolysed casein or standard cow milk based weaning formula. Duration of breast feeding is at the mothers' discretion. Recruitment and intervention will be completed by the second year of this proposal for trial continuation. All subjects are followed during and after the intervention period for 10 years with measurements of serological markers of intact cow milk exposure, diabetes predictive autoantibodies (the end point at age 6 years) and the clinical and/or metabolic indices of diabetes (the end point at age 10 years). A large, cross-linked repository of stored sera, DNA and cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells allows independently funded ancillary and mechanistic studies related to the natural history of prediabetes and the hypothesis to be tested. Cow milk protein is the most common intact foreign weaning protein in humans. If our intervention is effective in delaying autoimmunity or its progression to diabetes, this first ever primary prevention study of T1D will have far-reaching impact for individuals and the global society.

       " 'Columbia University has assembled an experienced team of investigators and staff with William T. Friedewald, MD as Principal Investigator to provide the expertise and resources necessary to serve as the Data Coordinating Center as requested in the RFA entitled: Cooperative Multicenter Traumatic Brain Injury Clinical Trials Network.  There has been long standing awareness of the primary and secondary consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) with an estimated 50,000 deaths annually and 80,000 people permanently disabled. The research interest has focused on developing therapies that will reduce the significant acute phase mortality, that will minimze the secondary neurological injury, and that will improve the long-term functional outcome of those who survive. To these ends the NICHD proposes to fund a network of sites that will undertake clinical trials in both the acute and rehabilitation phases of TBI. The participants will be recruited from up to 8 clinical sites in the United States with a project period of 5 years. The Network Steering Committee faces some interesting challenges in designing and implementing such trials, including the need 1)to establishuniform case definitions and standards of care that will serve as, and will be uniformly accepted as, a basis for the quantitative evaluation of the proposed interventions, 2) to develop a scientifically rigorous, and feasible protocol for treating people acutely with TBI, and 3) to also develop another protocol that will evaluate either specific rehabilitation efforts or more broadly rehabilitationstrategies in the survivors of TBI. This will require the development of: i) training programs for the clinical site staffs generally and in the management of intracranial pressure, ii) a complex, web-based database that will allow the collection and management of data from the trials and that can then be shared among and between all of the Network participants, and iii) an infrastructure for the trials that will enable the addition of new research protocols. To meet these design and integration challenges our proposal offers a team of investigators with unusually experienced people in the key positions. These include the P.I.with his unusally diverse clinical trial research background, the Senior Statistician with his broad statistical experience and interest in clinical trial research, the Data Management Director with his extensive experience managing large data sets from clinical trials and other research efforts, and finally the clinical and research skills in TBI of our proposed clinical advisory team.  The overall goal of our proposal is to provide the coordination of the multiple study sites, the data management and quality control activities, and the analytical and statistical support that will enable the Steering Committee and the NICHD to successfullyintegrate the Network sites and successfullycomplete the proposed clinicaltrials.',\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application provides evidence that the U.S. Principal and the Senior Foreign Investigator have an established leadership record in participation in the Global Network activities as well as in the design, implementation, and publication of single site and common protocol studies and clinical trials. For the next 5 year cycle, two rigorously-designed randomized clinical trials of antibiotic treatment of infants with suspected serious bacterial infection are proposed. Infection is one of the main causes of death in infants, accounting for about 36% of neonatal mortality worldwide. Current World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for the treatment of infants with suspected serious bacterial infection include injectable antibiotic therapy but there is limited capacity for intravenous or intramuscular antibiotic administration in many communities in developing countries. Hospitalization of ill infants is not possible frequently because of limited access to hospitals. Injectable antibiotics can be difficult to administer even in some facilities. Furthermore, infection or abscess formation as well as transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, or other pathogens is more common in developing countries. Oral antibiotic regimens have been an effective intervention in older infants and children with pneumonia but not in neonates and young infants with suspected serious bacterial infection. Expert consultants under the direction of WHO have recommended evaluating oral-only antibiotic regimes as alternatives to injectable antibiotics for infants with suspected serious bacterial infection. Thus, there is an urgent need to evaluate the effectiveness of early identification and innovative but simple antibiotic regimens to treat young infants with suspected serious bacterial infection in low and middle income countries. If an oral antibiotic regimen is found to be effective in young infants with suspected serious bacterial infection, antibiotic treatment to young infants with suspected serious bacterial infection may result in an important reduction in neonatal and infant mortality and morbidity worldwide. The proposed team of investigators will work with the NICHD and other sites of the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research to design, prioritize, plan, implement, analyze, interpret, and report innovative randomized trials and observational studies that are likely to improve maternal and childhood survival and reduce important morbidities. The qualifications and unequivocal commitment of the U.S. Principal Investigator, the Senior Foreign Investigator, and the team of investigators and staff in Zambia, as well as the full endorsement of the Government of Zambia, the University of Zambia, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham will ensure superior performance if this site is allowed to continue participation in the Global Network.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Malaria, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and tuberculosis (TB), are frequent in pregnant women (PW) in sub-Saharan Africa and are important preventable causes of poor birth outcomes and maternal morbidity and mortality. Many PW in Africa seek antenatal care (ANC) but do not receive appropriate care for these infections, although presumptive therapy (PT) with antibiotics or antimalarials and preventive therapy for TB can be effective. The antenatal visit thus represents a \"missed opportunity\" to improve maternal and infant health in resource-poor settings.      We propose to develop two new antenatal interventions against these infections that can be widely implemented in the region. First, we will evaluate PT with azithromycin (AZM) in high-risk PW. AZM is effective against bacterial STIs; however cost-effective, practical PT regimens need to be identified. AZM also has antimalarial activity; by combining AZM with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP; standard-of-care PT for malaria), we hope to improve effectiveness and delay the onset of SP-resistant malaria. Second, we will test the safety of, and compliance with, a short-course regimen for latent TB infection in HIV (+) PW.       We propose to work in two large antenatal care clinics in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo where we are currently offering antenatal HIV screening and treatment. At these clinics, our team will concurrently conduct two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials: (1) a four-arm trial to determine the efficacy of presumptive AZM (2 g) treatment taken by high-risk HIV (-) PW in the second trimester, third trimester, neither or both times (with all groups receiving SP); and (2) a separate two-arm trial in HIV (+), TB-infected PW to compare the safety of (and compliance to) the standard regimen of 9 months of isoniazid 300 mg/d with a short course regimen of 3 months of isoniazid (300 mg/d) plus rifampin (600 mg/d) for latent M. tb infection.      This project is one of the first attempts to develop an integrated, practical approach to managing highly prevalent malaria, STIs, and TB in PW in resource-poor Africa. It will build on a productive history of collaboration between investigators in the USA and Kinshasa, especially Projet SIDA, where large longitudinal cohort studies in PW have been successful. It will also build upon, and augment, a burgeoning, multidisciplinary research and training program at the Kinshasa School of Public Health.',\n",

       " \"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The fusion of sperm and egg lead to the combination of the father's and mother's genetic information to create a new individual. In humans, as in all mammals, sperm must reach the egg, penetrate its protective coat, fuse with the oocyte membrane, and deliver its genetic material. Ion channels in the sperm mediate many of these steps, but most of these ion channels are also present in other tissues, including brain and heart. We have identified a class of ion channels, called CatSpers (Cation channel of Sperm) that are in mature sperm but not in any other tissues of the body, including developing organs. CatSpers are six transmembrane-spanning ion channel proteins localized primarily to the tail of mature sperm (Ren et al., 2001). CatSper1, the first of these ion channels to be identified, triggers calcium influx into the principal piece of the sperm tail. Calcium is required for sperm motility, and sperm from mice genetically engineered to lack the functional CatSper1 gene show a significant reduction in motility. Male mice homozygous for null-mutations in the CatSper1 gene are infertile (100%), but otherwise are completely normal. Another related sperm-specific protein, CatSper2, is also localized to its tail. Since these ion channels are only in mature sperm and required for fertility, a specific agent that blocks channel function should prevent fertilization. Experiments are proposed that will enable the expression of these novel genes in heterologous cell lines suitable for large-scale screening for small molecule blockers. This will provide a viable assay for screening for male contraceptive agents.        \",\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of male contraceptives is highly desirable, as worldwide there is a large unmet need for alternative methods for family planning. Therefore, it is important to identify and investigate ways, by which male fertility can be regulated. Oral administration of the alkylated imino sugars N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) and N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin (NB-DGJ) causes reversible infertility in male mice. The mice are infertile because they produce morphologically abnormal spermatozoa that are mostly without acrosomes, and have reduced motility. To understand the chain of events underlying this phenomenon, the long-term objectives are the following: (1) Identify the biochemical processes that are modulated, directly, or indirectly, by alkylated imino sugars that cause male mice to be infertile; (2) Correlate these biochemical changes with the cell biological peculiarities seen in testes from mice after administration of alkylated imino sugars.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The proposed research has three components. (1) Significance of known drug targets.  Investigated will be whether male infertility is caused by inhibition of one of the known targets of NB-DNJ and NB-DGJ, which are the ceramide-speciflc glucosyltransferase and a non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of a glycosphingolipid, glucosylceramide. Assessed will be the effects of NB-DNJ on the level of testicular glucosylceramide, as well as its cellular and subcellular distribution, and the localization of the enzyme that is the primary drug target. (2) Novel drug targets. Since the alkylated imino sugars are ceramide-mimics, it is essential to establish whether these compounds also affect the metabolism of glycolipids other than glucosylceramide. This may lead to the identification of additional drug targets. (3) Consequences of altered glycosphingolipid metabolism for male germ cell development. The following aspects of the biochemistry and cell biology of spermatids will be studied: crosstalk between sphingolipid and phospholipid metabolism, the lipid and protein composition of sphingolipid/cholesterol-enriched microdomains, trafficking and turnover of acrosomal proteins, and ultrastructure. To develop reagents for the investigation of acrosome development, a proteomic analysis of this organelle will be performed.      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objective of the present application is to study a novel regulatory pathway of gene expression in mouse spermiogenesis that could be exploited for development of novel male contraceptives. Spermiogenesis is a complex differentiation process by which haploid germ cells transform into mature spermatozoa. In the past few years, genetic studies in mice have identified four genes that cause a global arrest in early spermiogenesis when deleted in mice, and these genes constitute a group of key regulators of spermiogenesis (CREM, TRF2, MIWI, and TPAP). In this project, we will characterize a novel key regulator of spermiogenesis named RNF17 in mice. Our specific aims are: 1) Knockout mice will be generated and characterized to study the regulation of spermiogenesis; 2) Proteins interacting with the novel key regulator will be screened using the yeast 2-hybrid system, and will be characterized biochemically and cell biologically; 3) Genes transcriptionally regulated by the novel key regulator will be identified by the gene array technology using both the Affymetrix mouse gene chips and our own germ cell microarrays. Our  [unreadable] proposed genetic, biochemical and genomics experiments will define a novel regulatory network of gene expression in mouse spermiogenesis, will have implications in molecular etiology of male infertility in humans, and will provide critical information about regulation of spermiogenesis that could be explored for developing reversible male contraceptive leads with minimal side effects.

       " 'Modern contraceptive methods have a surprisingly short history and are dominated by a few methods such as the oral contraceptive pill for women or physical barrier methods such as condoms for men. In spite of the lack of choice of methods, studies show that men aspire to play a greater role in the regulation of fertility. Some effort in the past has been focused on development of male contraceptives which focused on hormonal and immunological control of spermatogenesis, but few studies have focused on developing a male contraceptive that will alter the activity of key genes that regulate spermatogenesis. This is the approach that we outline. It is a timely approach, as with the completion of the human genome project and those of model organisms, we have unprecedented knowledge of the genes and proteins that are likely to govern the development of sperm. In our preliminary studies, we have identified genes that encode male fertility factors in Drosophila, discovered homologs in mice and humans, and begun to explore mechanisms of male infertility by examining the phenotypes of sterile mutant flies and knockout mice. The objectives of this research are to identify and to characterize novel gene targets involved in the regulation of male fertility and to lay the ground work for the development of male contraceptives against those targets. We will screen mouse ES gene trap cell library for male reproductive genes identified through our comparative genomics analysis, to generate mouse knockout mutants disrupting the conserved male fertility factors, to characterize the roles of those key regulators during sperm production and maturation, and finally to provide a resource of male reproductive mutants for researchers in the contraceptive field as well as in the reproductive field.',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The epididymis plays a crucial role in the maturation of spermatozoa and is, therefore, considered to be a prime target for the development of a male contraceptive. Our strategy is to target receptors, kinases and phosphatases within the epididymis that are crucial for male fertility. These targets are ideal because they are amenable to small molecular weight inhibitors and the blood-epididymis barrier would not be a formidable hurdle for such inhibitors. With these strategies in mind, our goal is to examine the orphan tyrosine kinase receptor c-Ros as a target for male contraceptive development. We are also interested in identifying the components of upstream regulators and downstream targets of c-Ros as targets for male contraceptive development. C-Ros was chosen because c-Ros knockout male mice are infertile. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To test the hypothesis that modulating the expression and activity of c-Ros can regulate fertility in adult male mice. To accomplish this specific aim we will generate a novel conditional c-Ros knockout in the initial segment of mice. (2) To test the hypothesis that the activity of c-Ros is dependent upon the association of its kinase domain with other binding proteins including novel and known kinases and phosphatases. Proteins that associate with c-Ros activity will be considered as targets for the development of a male contraceptive. We will generate an initial segment-specific conditional knockout of the SHP-1 phosphatase, which binds to the kinase domain of c-Ros. (3) To test the hypothesis that the activity of c-Ros is dependent upon its association of its extracellular domain with a membrane-bound receptor. We will generate an initial segment-specific conditional knockout of the metabotropic glutamate receptor-like orphan G-protein coupled receptor, which is the putative ligand for c-Ros. Expression and activity of downstream kinases, phosphatases and receptors that change in the initial segment of each putative infertile knockout animal will be identified and considered further as targets for contraceptive development. Therefore, in accordance with the research scope of the RFA, we will perform \"research on the processes of sperm maturation with the goal of defining specific targets, involved in the control of male fertility.\"      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  During spermatogenesis, developing germ cells must remain attached to the seminiferous epithelium via specialized anchoring junctions between Sertoli and germ cells. This project seeks to identify the regulatory molecules and signaling pathways that regulate the cell-cell actin-based adherens junction (AJ), such as the ectoplasmic specialization (ES, a testes-specific AJ type), in the seminiferous epithelium. If this information is known, cell adhesion function between Sertoli and developing germ cells can be manipulated and perturbed, thereby inducing germ cell loss from the seminiferous epithelium. Since germ cells found in the semen are immature, they will lack the ability to fertilize the egg and infertility will result. This approach specifically targets the site of cell-cell interactions in the testes and does not interfere with the hypothalamus-pituitary-testicular hormonal axis. As such, side effects, if any, will be minimal. The P.l.'s laboratory has utilized an in vivo model to study AJ dynamics with the use of AF-2364 [1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-indazole-3-carbohydrazide] to perturb cell adhesive function in the seminiferous epithelium. These recent studies have shown that Sertoli-germ cell AJ dynamics in vivo are regulated by: (i) the integrin/Rho B/ROCK/LIM kinase/cofilin and (ii) the integrin/p-FAK/p130 Cas/PI 3-kinase signaling pathways. These findings will now be vigorously tested using another model of in vivo AJ dynamics, namely the androgen depletion-induced spermatid loss (step 8 spermatids and beyond) from the epithelium using testosterone plus estradiol implants. Furthermore, contemporary techniques of biochemistry (e.g., chemical cross-linking of proteins, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting), cell biology (e.g., immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescent and confocal microscopy, immunogold electron microscopy) molecular biology (e.g., real-time RT-PCR, antisense ODNs, and RNA interference) will be used to dissect the molecular architecture of the ES and desmosome (a cell-cell intermediate filament-based anchoring junction type), and to explore the significance of signaling molecules and the pathways that regulate cell adhesion in the testes. In addition, the signaling pathways utilized by the multiprotein complexes residing at the sites of ES and desmosomes will be further characterized using specific inhibitors of the downstream protein kinases together with established in vitro and in vivo models of AJ restructuring. In summary, these studies not only will define the regulation of AJ dynamics, they will identify new leads and innovative approaches for male contraceptive development.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Each year, over 1 million abortions are performed in the US as a consequence of unintended pregnancy. Unintended pregnancies therefore have a significant negative impact on both the individual and society. Contraception is an effective method of reducing unintended pregnancies. One way to further reduce the rate of unintended pregnancies is to develop safe and effective methods for reversible male contraception. Hormone based approaches have been developed for use in men. However, these can have significant side effects including the length of time required for both contraception and its reversal. In theory, a specific inhibitor of spermiogenesis could be a powerful contraceptive method, as it should take effect, and be reversed, relatively quickly. Thus, a challenge for basic research is to improve our understanding of the gene products and pathways required for spermiogenesis so that some of these discoveries may be translated into novel approaches for male contraception. Towards this goal, we have used random insertional mutagenesis in mice to identify genes required specifically for mammalian spermatogenesis. Homozygous symplastic spermatids (sys) male mice are sterile due to a defect in spermatid-Sertoli cell adhesion just prior to spermatid elongation. The sys mutation involves a deletion of 1.2 Mb of mouse chromosome 14 that appears to contain only one, novel gene. This gene is predicted to encode a membrane-anchored structural protein with a proline rich N-terminus. We hypothesize that a defect in this novel gene is responsible for the sterility in sys homozygote males, that this gene functions in the Sertoli cell to mediate spermatid-Sertoli adhesion, and that inhibition of the genes function in fertile adult male mice could block spermatid development. Five specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. First, we shall generate male mice with a specific mutation of the novel gene and verify that they are sterile. Second, we shall use germ cell transplantation to investigate whether the function of the novel gene is required in germ cells or somatic cells within the testes. Third, we shall analyze the expression pattern and subcellular distribution of the gene product in testes using RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and biochemical methods. Fourth, we shall investigate how the gene product functions by identifying proteins that interact with it in the testes. Finally, we shall investigate whether inactivation of this gene in adult fertile male mice can block spermiogenesis. The results of this basic research will provide information about a new gene product whose function is required for spermatid-Sertoli adhesion. They will also provide an assessment of the suitability of this novel gene product as a potential target for development of new methods of male contraception.

       " 'RTI International (RTI), a trade name for Research Triangle Institute, proposes to become the Data Coordinating and Analysis Center (DCAC) for NICHD\\'s \"Research on the Scope and Causes of Stillbirth in the United States\" network. RTrs twenty-nine years of experience serving as DCAC for a vadety of multisite clinical and behavioral studies, many in the field of maternal and child health, enable us to recognize the various responsibilities that must be undertaken by a DCAC to successfully meet the ever changing needs of a multisite study. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to: (1) participating in protocol development, (2) developing and implementing a study-wide communications network, (3) providing sophisticated data collection and management systems that are responsive to the emerging needs of the study, (4) supporting the logistics of the study as needed, (5) assisting in training site personnel in standard study procedures, (6) assisting in developing and implementing quality control and quality assurance procedures, (7) providing biostatistical and data management leadership, (8) producing both routine and ad hoc reports that meet the needs of the Clinical Sites, NICHD, the Steering Committee, the Advisory Committee and the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee, and (9) helping to disseminate the results of the study through publications and presentations. The key staff proposed for the project, Dr. Corette Parker, PI, and Dr. Matthew Koch, Co-PI, are both senior biostatisticians with supporting programs in epidemiology. They each have over 15 years experience managing DCAC activities and leading statistical tasks for multisite studies. Dr. Koch\\'s medical degree provides an additional badge between the statistical and medical components of the network. As the demands of the network change, we will be able to supplement our base staff with needed expertise from our large staff with vaded backgrounds that address the anticipated needs of the study. RTI\\' office next door to NICHD in Rockville, MD provides meeting space as needed for interaction with NICHD staff.  During the first year of the project, RTI will collaborate with NICHD and the Steering Committee to develop the study protocol with particular input into statistical design and analysis, data capture methods, data management and processing, quality control, and training of site data collection and data management staff.',\n",
       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Glycolysis is required for mammalian sperm function and fertilization. Several sperm glycolytic enzymes have distinctive properties, and three isozymes in this pathway are products of genes that are expressed only in spermatogenic cells. Two of these germ cell-specific isozymes, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-S (GAPDS) and phophoglycerate kinase-2 (PGK2), are located at a key transition point in the pathway between the two phases that consume and produce ATP. Selective inhibition of either of these isozymes would eliminate ATP production by glycolysis without affecting energy production in other tissues, indicating that GAPDS and PGK2 may be excellent contraceptive targets. Our recent studies indicate that Gapds -/- male mice are infertile, producing sperm with no progressive motility and ATP levels that are 10% of normal levels. This proposal will determine if PGK2 is similarly required for sperm motility and male fertility, and will examine the enzymatic and structural characteristics of this isozyme with the goal of identifying selective inhibitors. The specific aims are to: 1) Determine if PGK2 is required for sperm motility and male fertility. The Pgk2 gene will be disrupted in mice by homologous recombination. Fertility, spermatogenesis and sperm function will be assessed in the Pgk2 -/- animals, including assays of sperm motility, morphology and ATP levels. 2) Identify unique structural features of PGK2 and design selective inhibitors of this isozyme. Molecular modeling studies will be used to determine features that distinguish PGK2 from PGK1, the isozyme present in somatic tissues. Potential active site inhibitors will be identified by virtual screening, and the most promising candidates will be tested against recombinant PGK2 and PGK1 to identify selective inhibitors of PGK2. 3) Determine the mechanisms for PGK2 localization in sperm. Like other glycolytic enzymes, PGK2 is bound to structural components of sperm. To provide a better understanding of protein interactions that are essential for high levels of glycolytic ATP production to support sperm motility, we will determine if PGK2 is localized in the principal piece of the sperm flagellum, identify proteins that interact with PGK2, and determine if PGK2 has a specific targeting sequence that is responsible for sperm localization. This proposal will identify novel features of PGK2 and determine if this sperm isozyme is a target for developing highly specific male contraceptives.        ',\n",

The proposed research involves three products, each of which involves collaborative research with a hotel company partner. The first product is an individual research project that uses daily diary methods to examine associations of daily work stressors with daily self reports and physiological measures (i.e., cortisol) of physical health, well-being, and productivity, within and across days. Specifically, we would add the collection and assaying of cortisol to an ongoing, Sloan Foundation-funded daily diary study of hotel managers and their spouses/partners (n = 120 couples), and we would develop a new daily diary investigation of the connections between work stressors and the same outcomes for hotel hourly workers (n = 120). The project would contribute to the network a sophisticated method by which it can examine, in subsequent large-scale intervention research, the day-to-day processes that occur when employees have access to new policies and practices and their implications for the health, well-being, and productivity of employees and their family members. We also propose to lead a collaborative project to identify appropriate measures of parenting for the network, via consultation with each network partner, reviewing the relevant literatures, and conducting focus groups at partners\\' work sites (including our own hotel company sites). The third product is a collaborative project to develop and pilot test a stress management intervention targeted at first-line supervisors (in our case, in hotels), and creates a survey tool that taps organizational readiness for interventions. Together, the activities of the network address an important public health issue: the implications of ongoing stressors in the workplace for the health and well-being of employed adults and their families. Pilot research of this kind is needed to plan large-scale interventions that would evaluate the extent to which \"family-friendly policies and practices\" at work make a measurable and significant difference in the lives of employees and their families. The results of such large-scale interventions will inform policy makers and employers and perhaps stimulate workplaces to provide more support for working families.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the clinical course of perinatally acquired HIV infection among adolescents and preadolescents, and the consequences of fetal and neonatal exposure to HIV and antiretroviral chemotherapy among a representative cohort of children in the United States presents a unique scientific opportunity. Recognizing this opportunity, the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to establish the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) to conduct research among two cohorts: A cohort of perinatally infected adolescents and preadolescents (age 7-18) will be established to evaluate the impact of HIV and ART on sexual maturation, pubertal development, and socialization, and a drug toxicity surveillance system among perinatally HIV exposed uninfected children will evaluate long-term effects of in-utero ART exposure. PHACS will be comprised of a Scientific Leadership Group (SLG), a Data and Operations Center (DOC), and up to 20 PHACS Clinical Investigator Sites. The Departments of Epidemiology and the Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research (CBAR) at the Harvard School of Public Health, Westat and Frontier Science will collaborate to form the PHACS DOC. In addition to collaborating to define the PHACS research agenda, during year 1 the PIs will provide methodological support for the development of all PHACS analytic projects, develop the (base and uninfected) core protocols, develop and support an active CAB, write and manage a site solicitation, establish site sub-contracts, obtain and merge all preexisting data bases from previous cohorts (PACTG 219/219C, WITS, PSD), and plan and conduct all LG and full PHACS Network Meetings.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Coordinating Center (CC) of the PHACS consists of the PI, project director, and a group of leading investigators comprising the Scientific Leadership Group (SLG). Together with the Data Operations Center, the CC will establish the leadership structure of the PHACS including an Executive Committee (EC), an External Oversight Committee, and the SLG. The EC will be the main governing body of the PHACS and will provide oversight and final approval for all group activities. The CC will be responsible for overall management of the PHACS. The SLG will be responsible for defining the scientific agenda of the PHACS and, during year 1, the development of the two protocols which will address this agenda, each with its own cohort of subjects, specific objectives, and sub-studies. The Drug Toxicity Surveillance System will evaluate the safety of preventive antiretroviral therapy when administered to HIV-exposed infants in utero and in the newborn period. This will be an open protocol with ongoing accrual; initially subjects will be enrolled from the WITS and PACTG 219c studies. It will generate a cohort of HIV-uninfected children who will be monitored longitudinally for the development of mitochondrial disease, abnormalities in growth and development, and other end-organ disease. The Base Protocol will address the impact of HIV-infection on sexual maturation, pubertal development, and socialization of perinatally HIV-infected preadolescents and adolescents and define the course of perinatal HIV infection during adolescence. It will be a closed cohort, consisting of subjects 7-16 years of age who were previously enrolled in WITS and 219c. The Base Protocol will be fully coordinated with the CDC Legacy Project in order to expand the population available to study uncommon events. Once the protocols are developed in year one, a variety of focused sub-studies, utilizing one or both of the cohorts, will be developed by the SLG in order to address a variety of specific scientific questions. For the Base Protocol cohort, these include: neurodevelopmental and academic/vocational outcomes; changes in growth, development, body composition, and metabolism; mitochondrial disease and other toxicities resulting from ART; hyperlipidemias, other cardiac risk factors, and cardiovascular complications; reproductive and gynecologic outcomes and HPV infections; and infectious and non-infectious complications of HIV infection.

       " 'The PATH Youth Program (PATH=Psychoso,cial, Advocacy, Treatment for HIV+ Youth) is a multidisciplinary collaboration of experienced HIV researchers and care providers designed to improve the health and well- being of pre-adolescents and adolescents on the North side of Chicago. PATH\\'S \"one stop shopping\" program brings together the strengths of academic medicine and community-based health care to create unique, comprehensive and barrier-free interdisciplinary services for HIV+ and at-risk HIV- adolescents and young adults age 12-24. Since its inception in 2001, PATH\\'S adolescent-specific care providers have merged the resources of Children\\'s Memorial Hospital and Howard Brown Community Health Center into one seamless model of care offering adolescents the full range of clinical, outreach/prevention, and social support services. Engagement and participation in clinical trials and HIV prevention research is central to the mission of PATH. Our program\\'s experienced researchers, including Principal Investigator (PI), Robert Garofalo MD MPH, co-investigator Ram Yogev MD, study coordinators, and outreach/recruitment staff, have conducted and led multi-center collaborative trials in pediatric and adolescent populations with a proven track record of recruitment, retention and site performance for clinical and prevention research with HIV+ and HIV- youth. At present, PATH provides comprehensive care to 146 HIV+ youth (the majority of whom have experience participating in research) as well as a diverse array of at-risk youth, including the homeless, youth of color, young women, gay and bisexual young men, and transgender youth. PATH is uniquely positioned to contribute to the scientific agenda of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network (ATN). The program\\'s innovative and integrated approach to adolescent health and well-being in the Chicago North side community and our experienced research and clinical team offer an unparalleled opportunity to broaden the ATN\\'s commitment to community work with disadvantaged, hard-to-reach adolescents.',\n",
       " \"The rising incidence of HIV/AIDS in the adolescent and young adult population in the United States is alarming. It is now estimated that 25% - 50 % of new cases in the U.S. are occurring in youth. Memphis and the surrounding area are no exception and its Southern location and large minority population has also impacted the rapid increase in cases. The successful conduct of clinical trials in adolescents requires a site with comprehensive medical services, compassionate and interested staff, case management services, a friendly clinic environment, and support for incidentals. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) is a large research center that has provided comprehensive care for HIV-infected infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women since 1988 with demonstrated excellence in clinical trials performance in the adolescent population. We propose an alternate practice site at the University of Tennessee (UT)/Methodist LeBonheur Health Systems (MLHS). MLHS is the site for UT's General Adolescent Clinics and MAYAH, the community Ryan White, Title IV, Youth Services Program. This alternate site will be staffed by St. Jude ATN personnel and compliment the main research unit in the identification, recruitment, and conduct of trials in HIV-at risk but uninfected adolescents. This model engages many community education, outreach, and testing facilities that will be key in implementing community mapping and vaccine preparedness studies. The specific aims of this project are: 1) To establish an effective adolescent clinical trials unit to further the scientific agenda of the Adolescent Trials Network through the recruitment and retention of HIV-infected and at-risk HIV-uninfected pre-adolescents, adolescents, and young adults into biomedical and behavioral clinical trials; 2) To further develop existing community linkages to effectively establish a community-based primary prevention infrastructure that will support clinical trials of HIV prevention efforts, including vaccines, and other biomedical modalities; and 3) To contribute to the scientific agenda of the Adolescent Trials Network through the participation of investigators and site personnel in the development of protocol concept sheets and protocols. An ATU in Memphis would offer the combined advantages of an established, productive clinical research center with the proximity of a large at-risk population to maximize realization of the research efforts in the adolescent population.\",\n",

The CCHN will comprise a cooperative agreement among the NICHD, three-to-five Clinical Research Sites (CRSs), and one DCAC. The CCHN will have a Steering Committee (SC) and a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Phase I of the CCHN is near completion and Phase II will consist of a cohort study with 4,000-5,000 participants in the perinatal period who will be followed until their next pregnancies. The CCHN will screen and recruit participants, measure social and biological indicators, and assess outcome variables in the mothers and infants. The Department of Health Evaluation Sciences (DHES) at The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine proposes to serve as the DCAC for the CCHN. The DCAC will pursue five specific aims to enhance the effectiveness of the CCHN: (1) provide statistical leadership and scientific coordination in the areas of trial design, conduct, analysis, presentations, and publications; (2) establish and maintain the CCHN computer network and websites, one for the general public and a password-protected, secure site for CCHN members; (3) design and maintain the CCHN data management system that relies on a web-based system; coordinate and track CCHN biological specimens; (4) develop and maintain the CCHN data quality assurance and monitoring program to ensure the highest quality data possible; (5) provide project management and administrative support to render smooth and efficient operations in the CCHN. Dr. Chinchilli, the proposed Principal Investigator (principal investigator) of the CCHN DCAC, has extensive experience as the principal investigator of two data coordinating centers (DCCs) for clinical research networks funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), namely, the Asthma Clinical Research Network and the Childhood Asthma Research and Education Network. Because DHES has successfully pioneered many approaches for DCC activities in a clinical research network, the NHLBI Division of Lung Diseases enlisted DHES to train the awardees of the DCCs for two other clinical research networks that it recently formed. Dr. Chinchilli's Co- Investigators for the DCAC include faculty members with additional experience in pediatric statistical issues (Dr. Shaffer), statistical modeling of social and behavioral sciences data (Dr. Rovine), statistical genetics (Dr. Liu), pediatric research (Dr. Paul), adverse pregnancy outcomes (Dr. Weisman), and disparities in children's health (Dr. Hillemeier).

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tufts University School of Medicine and the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College Nagpur, India, affiliated with Lata Medical Research Foundation, are proposing to expand their longstanding multidisciplinary collaboration and partnership in the study of childhood pneumonia and are applying to participate in the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research. The goal of this participation is to improve scientific knowledge and outcomes in neonates and young children and to expand capacity and infrastructure in the research unit at Nagpur, India. Their proposal for the Global Network application focuses on childhood pneumonia. Every year, at least 2 million children under age 5 die of pneumonia - more than the number of children who die of AIDS, malaria and measles combined. Mortality is highest in children who are hypoxemicor infected with HIV, where mortality rates are as high as 80%. Hypoxemia has long been recognized as an important predictor of mortality and poor outcome in childhood pneumonia. The World Health Organization's case-management strategy uses woefully inadequate clinical signs to detect hypoxemia, missing about 30% of children who are hypoxemic. These children do not receive much needed oxygen therapy and bear the brunt of adverse outcomes. Investment in pulse oximetry to detect hypoxemia in rural and district hospitals worldwide has not occurred, partly because no clinical trial has been conducted to determine whether access to pulse oximetry is either life-saving or cost-effective. We propose that Global Network sites conduct a cluster randomized trial to evaluate whether access to pulse oximetry and training providers in its use to guide oxygen therapy decreases treatment failure and mortality in children with pneumonia. The study will be conducted in rural hospitals that currently have no access to pulse oximetry. We will assess whether this approach is cost effective. We will also determine the microbiologic predictors of treatment failure and mortality in the eras of HIV infection and increasing antimicrobial resistance, as the etiology of pneumonia in the community setting in developing countries has not been studied since the 1980s. Introduction of pulse oximetry is a simple, easy to use, inexpensive and highly relevant technology that has the potential to improve outcomes, in a sustainable way, for one of the most pressing global health problems - childhood pneumonia.

This East African site will be a joint partnership between Indiana University and Moi University School of Medicine, one of two medical schools in Kenya. The 17 year partnership of Moi University and Indiana University will bring unique strengths to the Global Network. These include an established administrative, scientific, and collegial relationship between the institutions, an extensive research infrastructure that includes an established network of rural health centers from which to draw subjects, a well functioning Kenyan Institutional Review Board with a OHRP Assurance number, and an established expanding coverage of subjects by an electronic medical record. The Senior Foreign Investigator is Dean of the Medical School, and has well established relationships with high level Ministry of Health personnel. A large number of other Moi University investigators with expertise in Obstetrics, Public Health, Nutrition, Epidemiology, and Behavioral Sciences are also eager to join the Global Network. US based expertise is also present in Obstetrics, Biostatistics, and Bioethics. We propose to the Network a cluster randomized protocol evaluating the efficacy of both Community Mobilization for the use of a Safe Water System (SWS) and for zinc supplementation in partially weaned infants less than 6 months of age. The SWS includes specially designed narrow neck water storage containers and point of use home chlorination using dilute sodium hypochlorite. Hypotheses to be tested are that 1.) Community Mobilization will result in sustained, consistent use of point of use water treatment 2.) This will lead to a decreased incidence of diarrhea in less than 6 month old infants. 3.) Zinc supplementation beginning at partial weaning will lead to a further decrease in the incidence of diarrhea in these infants. 4.) Growth will be improved and failure to thrive decreased in experimental groups. 5.) All cause mortality in >6 month old infants will be decreased in experimental groups. If efficacy is shown, these are highly sustainable interventions that will improve the health and well being of vulnerable infants.   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",

To address this critical gap, the NIH and the CDC formed the Work, Family, and Health Network (WFHN). During Phase 1, WFHN designed and conducted multiple pilot and feasibility studies. For Phase 2, the WFHN has been called upon to implement an innovative intervention based on Phase I pilot studies and to evaluate the intervention using a group randomized experimental design. The goal of the proposed study is to assess the effects of a workplace intervention designed to reduce work-family conflict, and thereby improve the health and well being of employees, their families, and their workplaces. The study intervention is grounded in theory from multiple disciplines and supported by findings from our pilot/feasibility studies on the importance of increasing family supportive supervisor behaviors and employees\\' control over work. We will assess the efficacy of the intervention via group-randomized field experiments, one at each of two employers representing different industries. Within each industry partner, 30 worksites of 50-120 employees each will be randomly assigned to intervention or usual practice conditions. All employee and supervisor participants will be assessed at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 18-months post baseline, including survey interviews and health assessments of cardiovascular risk and sleep dysregulation based on selected biomarkers and actigraphy. Employees\\' spouse/partners and/or children (one resident child per employee) aged 10-17 years will be assessed to document the impact of the intervention on family functioning. In addition, to provide a more detailed perspective on the temporal relationship of work-family conflict and health, a sub-sample of 500 employee participants and their child will participate in a daily diary assessment including telephone interviews and saliva sampling. Our process evaluation documents details of intervention fidelity, implementation, and dose received by participants. The WFHN will also translate findings to business environments and other public media channels. The study holds great promise for informing the implementation of evidence-based family friendly policies, and therefore improving the health and well-being of employees and their families nationwide. The Portland State University, Center for Work-Family Stress, Safety, and Health, was established during Phase 1 of the WFHN, and is applying to serve as one of 4 Research Units (RU) for Phase 2. Our center has experience in designing, implementing and evaluating worksite interventions within the retail/service industry, and expertise in occupational health psychology, organizational behavior, human resource and employer work-family policy implementation, contributing significantly to the Phase 2 WFHN. We have primary responsibility for developing and maintaining the relationship with one of the employers.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " 'The goal is to prepare tenfold redundant Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BAG) libraries for species selected by an NIH advisory committee and to disseminate the libraries in accordance with NIH policy. The libraries will be tailored to the scientific community\\'s interest in comparative genomics and be used in support of whole-genome sequencing projects. The project is a continuation of an earlier cooperative agreement between the NIH and the Children\\'s Hospital Oakland Research Institute. The application has four components relevant to preparing (BACs): 1) Library preparation, 2) Clone Arraying & Library Duplication, 3) Characterization, and 4) Research & Development to improve the process efficiency and BAG library quality. During the first year, four BAG libraries will be prepared for genomes having a typical mammalian genome size. This corresponds with an \"800,000 BAG clone\" preparation capacity. During years two and three of the program, improvements in BAG construction methods may result in slight increases in throughput. The small size of the continuation program does not offer opportunities for \"economy of scale\" improvements. The new libraries will complement the extensive repertoire of BAG clone collections already available for comparative genome analysis. The new clone collections will be analyzed by a standardized set of tests, including screening with a set of genomic markers, limited BAC-end sequencing and insert size determination. Once the libraries pass the quality controls, the new resources will be made available in a format consistent with major applications. To facilitate access to the BAG libraries, a screening service based on cost recovery by user fees has been established. It is expected that the new BAG resources will continue to contribute to better understanding of human gene function and evolution through comparison of human genes with a growing spectrum of animal species. BAG clones will also increasingly be used as tools to create animal models for human diseases. Widespread dissemination of the clones is an essential component of the project. User fees for most libraries cannot cover the costs of maintenance. Hence, mimimal funding is requested in support of the maintenance of the new libraries and those generated under the previous program initiative.

With the recent accumulation of genome sequences for many organisms, most notably the draft human sequence, attention has turned to the identification and function of proteins encoded by these genomes. In the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) project, funded by the NIH, major European and American protein sequence databases have joined forces and developed a central resource for protein sequences and functions providing a cornerstone for a wide range of scientists active in modern biological research, especially in the field of proteomics.    [unreadable]   [unreadable] The broad, long-term objectives of this project are to provide with the Universal Protein Resource a stable and comprehensive resource for information on proteins, their sequences and their functions, to enable scientists to use UniProt to identify and analyze genes and their products and to make queries across databases containing complementary information, and to provide efficient and unencumbered access to the databases produced by the UniProt Consortium.    [unreadable]   [unreadable] The specific aims are to maintain and further develop the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) as the central database of curated protein sequences with annotations of sequence and functional information, to maintain and further develop the UniProt Archive (UniParc) and create the UniProtKB entry history server to ensure comprehensive coverage of all protein sequences and their annotation history, to maintain and further develop the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) to provide a complete covering of sequence space while hiding redundant sequences (but not their descriptions) from view, to facilitate the use of these databases by providing user-friendly interfaces, tools for simple and complex queries and for retrieval of large datasets,  down-loadable database records in defined, parsable format, and user support services; and to provide the flexibility and adaptability needed to be responsive to the changing needs of the scientific community.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The mouse shares 99% of the genes with humans and is an ideal research model for enhancing our understanding of human biology and disease and for testing potential therapeutics. Our ability to utilize the mouse model is limited by the number of mouse mutants and disease models (3000 - 4000) that are available to the research and pharmaceutical community. We have developed a new transposon system, called pB, which can be used to efficiently mutate a large number of genes in mice and other mammalian systems. This system has the following advantageous characters: 1. pB transposes efficiently in the mouse germline and can rapidly produce a large number of single pB insertion mutant strains; 2 Disrupted genes can be easily identified by PCR and sequencing; 3. pB insertions favor genes and have a wide genomic distribution; 4. pB insertions disrupt gene function when inserted into genes, and produce phenotypes similar to mutants generated by traditional knockout methods; 5. pB can carry large DNA fragments, e.g., an Act-RFP marker and a LacZ reporter, which can report gene expression patterns; 6. The resulting heterozygous or homozygous mutant animals and their wild-type siblings can be visually distinguished from each other without PCR or Southern using reporters such as Act-RFP; 7. Mutant animals are directly produced by simple breeding, which bypasses costly and challenging traditional techniques involving ES cells and surgery; 8. Visible genetic markers are employed in the breeding scheme to further improve efficiency and reduce cost; 9. All mutants are generated in an identical genetic background; 10. pB insertions can be precisely excised to revert the mutant phenotypes.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] We propose to utilize this pB insertional mutagenesis system and the cost-effective animal facility in Shanghai, China to produce 100,000 independent single pB insertion mutant strains in C57BL/6 mice in five years. We will determine the insertion sites, establish a database, and generate a comprehensive mouse KO resource which consists of frozen mutant embryos or sperm for approximately 20,000 unique genes or genetic loci. We estimate that the costs for the production and characterization of an independent insertion strain and for the storage of that strain are approximately $148 and $760, respectively.

The DCC will collect information from the KOMP research network, track progress of the knockout mutant production pipelines, and make the data readily available to the members of the KOMP research network and the general scientific community. In developing the DCC, we will leverage existing information resources, expertise, software, and collaborations.  [unreadable] The implementation plan for the DCC has four aims. We will (1) determine data content and  [unreadable] functionality of the DCC and build a database according to these specifications. The requirements for analysis and implementation will be determined in close collaboration with all members of the KOMP research network. We will (2) develop data acquisition procedures, curatorial standards for annotation, and pertinent quality control reports, in close collaboration with each funded KOMP project. Data files  [unreadable] received at the DCC will be reviewed by a combination of manual curation and electronic quality controls. We will (3) develop a DCC web site, query and display tools, database reports, and mechanisms for downloading specific sets of data. The web site will include general information about the KOMP project, query forms for simple and advanced queries, and a genome browser view of the status of mouse genes targeted and generated by the KOMP and other projects. We will (4) collaborate with KOMP related efforts to acquire up-to-date information on other publicly available null and conditional mutants, to integrate the DCC with the larger bioinformatics framework, and to disseminate KOMP data more broadly to the community. Data will be acquired from the International Mouse Gene Trap Consortium, the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Project (EUCOMM), the North American Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Project (NORCOMM), the Mouse Genome Informatics Database (MGI), the International Mouse Strain Resource (IMSR), and the German Resource Center. KOMP data will be exported to these efforts, and to other public databases such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser, and the ENSEMBL Genome Browser. Relevance to Public Health  [unreadable] The DCC will constitute a critical component of the Knockout Mouse Project, which has as its goal to generate mouse mutants for every gene in the mouse genome. These mutants will provide crucial insights into the function of mammalian genes and provide a powerful and important tool in the study of human disease.

The generation of mutant mice from C57BL/6-derived embryonic stem cells is currently not sufficiently robust for this project. Therefore we will start with ES cells derived from a highly-efficient 129 mouse strain, switching to C57BL/6 ES cells as soon as they have been validated for high-throughput gene targeting. The work will be done by a three member consortium of the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute in Oakland, CA (CHORI), the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK and the University of California Davis Mouse Biology Program (UCD-MBP). Targeting vectors will be created at CHORI by recombineering of BAG clones and will contain exchangeable modules based on Gateway(tm) technology. The vectors will be transferred into ES cells at Sanger and sequenced in full. Each target locus will be tagged with a lacZ reporter cassette that effectively disrupts the gene to create a null allele. Over 1 million ES cell colonies will be robotically arrayed during the course of the project. Allele structures will be confirmed through long-range PCR for up to 100 ES cell clones per targeting experiment. Five independent knock-out mutants will be archived for each gene to maximize the likelihood of germ-line transmission. Comprehensive quality assurance testing of 300 ES mutant lines annually in vitro and in vivo will take place under the direction of the MBP-UCD to ensure pluripotency, establish germ-line transmission, and confirm viability of live mice and cryopreserved embryos and sperm. Mutant ES cells and embryos will be split and placed in cryo-storage between Sanger and UCD, while modular targeting vectors will be stored at CHORI.

Knowing the functions for the complete set of genes in a model mammalian organism has obvious biological significance. The value of this information for human health and medicine is in its potential to aid in the discovery of new disease-related genes, to provide the tools needed to create new models for human disease, and to  [unreadable]   [unreadable]   [unreadable] help validate new drug targets. The Knock-Out Mouse Project (KOMP) has set the goal of creating a comprehensive resource of mouse mutations in which every gene in the mouse genome has been knocked out by a null mutation marked with a reporter system. To apply the power of targeted gene modification on the ambitious scale proposed by the KOMP demands significant technological improvements in throughput and capacity. We propose to use our high-throughput and validated VelociGene technology to create a library of 10,000 targeting vectors and a collection of 10,000 mouse ES cell clones, each carrying a definitive null mutation for a unique protein-coding gene. To meet our ambitious production targets, we describe a research plan organized to achieve the following specific aims:   [unreadable] 1. Construct a library of BAC-based targeting vectors (BacVecs) designed to create definitive null mutations(in most cases, deletions of the entire coding region) and incorporating a lacZ reporter of high utility for 10,000 mouse protein-coding genes.  [unreadable] 2. Using the BacVecs produced by Specific Aim 1, create a collection of C57BL/6 ES cell clones each  [unreadable] having a defined null allele and an incorporated reporter for each of 10,000 mouse protein-coding genes,and generate mice from 5% of these ES cell clones (500 mouse lines total) as a test of the collection for germ-line transmission.  [unreadable] 3. Create a library of BAC-containing recombination-ready E. coli clones (from Specific Aim 1) that can be used to engineer any desired additional allele (conditionals, replacements, and point mutations)for each of the 10,000 protein coding regions.  [unreadable] 4. Provide a database that allows real-time access to all production data and materials linked to the targetgene as the reference point.  [unreadable] 5. Devise a computer program that automates the design of null alleles.  [unreadable] 6. Robotically automate the preparation and quality control of BACs and BacVecs.  [unreadable] 7. Robotically automate the picking of ES cell clones and their expansion, storage and retrieval.  [unreadable] 8. Reduce the unit cost of our automated screening by decreasing reagent use and increase throughput and efficiency by improvements in automated data analysis, targeted clone scoring, and database entry.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Whole-genome association mapping, with all its theoretical power to detect genetic variants that contribute to common disease, is finally becoming practical. Most methods for analyzing data from these studies have envisioned scans with hundreds of thousands of SNPs in a relatively homogeneous population such as European Americans. However, the differences that exist among human populations also need to be taken into account. Even in a population that is relatively homogeneous, cases and controls may have different ancestral histories, which will result in \"population stratification\", or the population may be recently \"admixed\" as is the case for African-Americans and Hispanics. We propose to develop tools & methods for Population Substructure Analysis (PSSA) to deal with these issues in a disease-mapping scenario.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] (1) Our first aim will be to improve our already published methods and software (ANCESTRYMAP) for admixture mapping. Admixture mapping is a method for carrying out a genome-wide association study in a population of recent mixed ancestry such as African or Hispanic Americans, with far fewer markers than are needed for a homogeneous population. In the past two years great strides have been made in turning admixture mapping into a practical method, and we expect to continue to extend its applicability.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] (2) Our second aim will address the problem that whole-genome association scans with hundreds of thousands of SNPs will be severely compromised in their power to study a minority population such as African or Hispanic Americans unless methods are developed that search for association after inferring an individual\\'s ancestry state at each point in the genome. A key aim of PSSA is to build methods that allow fully-powered whole-genome association scans in minority groups.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] (3) Our third aim will be to provide a novel approach for correcting of population stratification in whole-genome association scans. Population stratification refers to systematic differences in ancestry between cases and controls, which can lead to allele frequency differences and false-positive associations.  Building on previous work we introduce new methods to measure and correct for stratification.  We believe our new techniques will provide near-optimal power, and will be computationally efficient.  We intend to make all these tools publicly available for the scientific community.  [unreadable]   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Accelerated by the arrival of genotyping technologies that have made typing dense but fixed sets of SNPs feasible for the first time, these studies will very soon create a bottleneck at the point where management and analysis of this data, as well as the design of large-scale follow-up experiments will be required. We propose to develop a series of methods which combine genome-wide association data, Human HapMap reference data and external genomics resources to powerfully analyze these data sets and, in addition, will implement and disseminate an integrated and user friendly system for interacting with and using the results of these analyses.    [unreadable]   [unreadable] Finding the genes underlying complex diseases offers one of the best long-term prospects for developing the understanding of disease required to develop truly successful preventions and cures. Genome-wide association studies are being undertaken but without optimal methods for analyzing this data and adequate software tools for interpreting the results, these studies will not realize their potential of opening up new avenues for disease research. This proposal aims to meet those analytic and computational needs so that the many studies being undertaken now and in upcoming years will be able to see their full impact.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The generation of complete or nearly complete eukaryotic genome sequences has produced an explosion of insights into the coding potential and evolution of genomes. However, we have less information about how key processes involving DMA are regulated, including transcription, replication, repair, and chromosome segregation. DMA sequence alone cannot be expected to reveal the mechanisms involved in genome regulation and inheritance, because these processes do not act on 'naked' DMA. In the context of the cell, DMA is packaged as chromatin, whose composition and organization regulate the accessibility and function of DMA sequences. Chromatin displays increasingly complex levels of organization and composition, starting with the basic nucleosome unit and progressing through higher order structures. Chromatin organization is critical for utilizing information stored in the genome; failure to accurately target or maintain chromosomal proteins and chromatin components results in aberrant patterns of gene expression and chromosome behavior, and is associated with many human diseases, most notably cancer. We propose to participate in the MODENCODE project by determining the locations of 125 chromosomal proteins and histone modifications across the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The proteins and modifications under study are involved in basic chromosomal functions such as DNA replication, gene expression, gene silencing, and inheritance. We will perform Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) with antibodies obtained commercially and generated and validated by this project, isolate and label the precipitated DNA, and apply the probes to genomic tiling arrays. Data generated by scanning the hybridized arrays will be analyzed by statistical methods, and the array data will be validated by independent analyses in cells and animals. We will initially assay localizations using chromatin from three cell lines and two embryonic stages, and will then extend the analysis of a subset of proteins to four additional animal tissues/stages. We will then perform a variety of comparisons between protein 'landscape' data sets, including analyses of combinatorial patterns of modifications and chromosomal proteins, tissue-specific differences, and interactions among proteins involved in the same epigenetic pathways. Finally, all validated data and analyses will be made available to members of the ENCODE project and scientific community. Successful completion of this project will provide basic information about the distributions of chromatin components across the Drosophila genome sequence, which will serve as a foundation for future functional studies. In addition, the data and analysis are highly likely to provide information critical to understanding the roles of chromatin in human cells and diseases.

We are motivated in this endeavor by the growing body of evidence that demonstrates fundamental cellular activities for diverse classes of RNAs in the 20-30 nucleotide range. One class that has received particular attention are the microRNAs, an abundant family of -22 nucleotide inhibitory RNAs that derive from hairpin precursor transcripts. It is estimated that there at least one thousand human microRNAs, which collectively regulate at least 30% of human genes. Additional classes of processed small RNAs include endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), repeat associated siRNAs, and Piwi-associated RNAs. We propose herein a focused set of experimental and computational experiments to characterize the small RNA component of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. (1) We will perform high-throughput pyrosequencing of a broad variety of libraries to obtain comprehensive coverage of expressed Drosophila small RNAs. (2) We will exploit the recent availability of a dozen sequenced fly genomes to make highly specific computational predictions of microRNA genes and microRNA targets in silico. (3) We will use microarray profiling and other molecular techniques to validate the endogenous expression of microRNAs and other novel small RNA genes. We will also perform in vivo phenotypic assays to demonstrate their biological activity. (4) We will elucidate the structures of primary microRNA transcripts by genetically stabilizing these transient species, followed by genome tiling microarray analysis. This work will culminate in a thorough annotation of the different classes of processed small RNAs and their associated precursor transcripts in Drosophila. Going beyond Drosophila, it is well documented that misregulation of small RNA pathways has tremendous adverse consequences for the development and physiology of all eukaryotic species. This comprehensive effort to uncover small RNA genes in flies will not only inform the annotation of small RNA genes in the human genome, but also lay the foundation for future studies of their normal and pathological roles. Insights gained from this genetically tractable model organism will be relevant for understanding the functional contributions of small RNAs to human disease.

The nematode C. elegans offers an extraordinary opportunity among eukaryotes to accomplish this goal now. The small, compact genome is completely sequenced. The simple anatomy, fixed cell lineage and transparent body through the full life span make each and every cell available for observation and analysis at any time.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Already more than 1,300 noncoding RNAs and 17,000 of the estimated 21,000 protein coding genes, along with 2,500 alternative splice forms, have been fully or at least partially defined experimentally. The present proposal seeks to complete the definition of the transcribed genome of C. elegans. We will do this by assembly of all the available experimental data with a variety of gene models to define accurately the extent of the known transcribed genome. From this base, we will extend our knowledge of the transcribed genome through systematic application of genome tiling arrays across various stages and cells of the life cycle, including targeted analysis of microRNAs. In turn we will integrate this new data along with any other new data from the community with the gene models and any new models that develop. We will attempt directed confirmation of unconfirmed gene models through RT-PCR and custom arrays, starting with the initial set of gene models and adding new data as it becomes available. We will also use mass spectrometry to distinguish protein coding transcripts from noncoding transcripts for small potential open reading frames. The result will be a set of transcripts that will approach completion for protein coding genes and their UTRs and alternative splice forms as well as non-coding RNAs. The experience gained with this modest genome should be of value in interpreting more complex genomes, such as human.   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Its genome shares the structure and major features of the human genome; all major families of transcription factors, both the basal machinery and site-specific factors; the overall regulatory structure of developmental genes such as the Hox clusters; many of the \"master regulatory\" transcription factor proteins such as PAX6/eyeless and Distalless that control organ or tissue identity. In many cases, human proteins function in Drosophila just as well as Drosophila proteins. In addition to the shared biology, the fly also offers powerful experimental tools not yet available for mammalian species. Its small genome size, at 130 Mb, is amenable to genome-wide systematic experimentation at a resolution not yet achievable in the human. Additionally, a total of 12 fully sequenced species provide one of the richest comparative genomic datasets, powerful enough to identify individual functional binding sites of regulators across the entire genome. Finally, the wealth of high throughput experimental techniques enables us to validate functional predictions in vivo. In this proposal, we exploit these unique features to produce a comprehensive cis-regulatory map of the Drosophila genome, using a combined experimental and computational approach. We will identify fly promoter regions, short and long range enhancers, insulator and repressor regions, and their defining characteristics based on cis-regulatory motifs and grammars, chromatin state, and transcription factor binding.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] This project serves as a pilot for the full-scale mapping of functional regulatory elements in the human genome. The methods and strategies developed will be crucial for informing the human genome. In addition, the body of knowledge gained will be invaluable in the understanding of many human diseases and disorders due to regulatory malfunction of gene regulation. Drosophila is an ideal model system for this project, for its compact genome size, experimental resources, and comparative genomics power, while retaining all the major characteristics of the human genome for the study of gene regulation.

We propose to build a genome-wide map of the binding sites for every C. elegans transcription factor. Moreover, over the course of this project, we will identify the exact localization of every transcription factor at single-cell resolution. These studies will be critical for deciphering the regulatory information housed in the genome to direct development and homeostasis. To maximize quality, speed, and comprehensiveness of the data collection, we have assembled a highly qualified team with extensive experience in performing the proposed goals, and developed a streamlined procedure for implementing these goals. First, we will make constructs in which each transcription factor is fused to a dual Myc-mCherry fluorescent tag. These constructs will be used to generate transgenic strains that express each tagged transcription factor at endogenous levels and locations. We will examine the temporal and spatial expression of each factor and determine its precise location using automated imaging techniques. Based on the optimal expression of each factor, we will perform genome-wide mapping of its binding sites in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by hybridization to a microarray containing probes distributed across the entire genome. These binding data will be validated by multiple methods, including quantitative PCR of ChIP samples, expression analysis in transcription factor knockout strains, and mutational analysis of candidate binding sites in transgenic reporters. We will perform bioinformatic analysis to identify regulatory motifs and compare motifs between factors. All data generated from this project will be stored in a web-accessible in-house database for use by the scientific community, and incorporated into the modENCODE consortium database and Wormbase.

The goal of this proposal is to identify discrete elements that regulate chromatin structure and function in the nematode C. elegans, a model metazoan of central importance in large-scale genomic research and gene function discovery. We will first use ChlP-chip and related methods to map the genomic distributions of selected histone modifications and chromosome-associated proteins, and then use that information, in combination with data from other modENCODE groups, to build quantitative models of chromatin function. Specifically, we will:  [unreadable]   [unreadable] 1. Identify and technically validate functional elements that control chromatin and chromosome behavior.   [unreadable] The focus of our analysis will be elements that specify nucleosome positioning and occupancy, control domains of gene expression, induce repression of the X chromosome, guide mitotic segregation and genome duplication, govern homolog pairing and recombination during meiosis, and organize chromosome positioning within the nucleus. 126 strategically selected targets include key histone modifications, histone variants, RNA polymerase II isoforms, dosage-compensation proteins, centromere components, homolog-pairing facilitators, recombination markers, and nuclear-envelope constituents. An efficient pipeline design will facilitate identification and validation of the different classes of functional elements associated with these targets and will integrate the results with the well-annotated C. elegans genome.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] 2. Biologically validate identified functional elements and build integrated, quantitative models of chromosome function.   [unreadable] We will integrate information generated in Aim 1 with existing knowledge on the biology of the targets, perform ChlP-chip analysis on mutant and RNAi extracts lacking selected target proteins, use extrachromosomal arrays to assess the ability of candidate identified sequence motifs to recruit targets in vivo, identify tissue-specific patterns of selected targets, and create integrated, quantitative models of transcription and whole-chromosome functions.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Achieving these goals in the context of the ongoing expansion and rich history of C. elegans research will provide an important milestone in meeting the challenge of using genome sequence information to understand and predict biological functions.

We will provide a description of the complete gene structures with transcription start sites, polyadenylation sites, and all detectable alternative transcripts. We plan to survey representative time points throughout development, a wide-variety of tissue types and well-characterized and novel cell lines. RNAs from these samples will be used for high-resolution expression profiling of the transcriptome using whole-genome tiling arrays, RNA ligase mediated Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends, RT-PCR and cDNA library construction. RT-PCR will be used to identify and isolate transcripts for rarely expressed genes of small to medium size. The cDNA libraries will be screened using a targeted approach to identify and isolate medium to large transcripts. Characterization of small RNAs (<100 bp) requires innovative strategies and we will use high-resolution (5bp) whole-genome tiling arrays and 454 sequencing. Concurrent with these studies will be a bioinformatic analysis to identify novel unannotated genes that for the first time utilizes algorithms that synthesize expression, comparative sequence and gene prediction. Further, we plan to characterize and annotate the extent of splice variation used to generate protein isoforms and identify the sequences necessary for regulated alternative splicing utilizing in vivo splicing reporter assays, RNAi and computational analysis. Finally, ncRNAs will be validated using in vivo tissue culture assays for expression and function. The scope of these studies is unprecedented and will provide the most comprehensive set of experimental evidence of transcription for any organism. As a public resource, these studies are a prerequisite for understanding normal growth and differentiation and that will aid in understanding these processes in other organisms, including humans. Drosophila models have been developed for Alzheimers, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In addition, genes first identified to play a role in Drosophila development are often components of conserved regulatory networks that play important roles during animal development and have been found, in humans, to contribute to the development of a variety of human cancers.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):   We propose to map major core histone variants throughout the annotated Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes at high resolution. These maps will provide a chromatin-based framework for interpreting epigenetic information and gene expression patterns determined by others. To accomplish this, we will use the biotin-tagging system that we have successfully applied for genome-scale chromatin affinity purification together with a standard microarray readout platform. In both D. melanogaster and C. elegans we will profile the universal replication-independent histone 3 variant, H3.3, as well as the control replication-coupled variant, H3. These data will provide high-resolution genome-wide maps of histone dynamics in both model organisms. The close correspondences of H3.3 patterns to patterns of active histone modifications genome-wide and with DNasel hypersensitive sites at homeotic gene clusters suggests that our genome-wide maps can be used to validate efforts aimed at mapping these other genomic features. In both D. melanogaster and C. elegans we will also profile the H2AZ variant, which has been linked to epigenetic processes in a variety of different organisms. Drosophila H2AZ plays a unique dual role as the H2AX variant, called H2AV, and our preliminary studies indicate that patterns of H2AV differ from those of H3.3, thus providing a different epigenetic profile of histone dynamics genome-wide. To expand our understanding of the functional roles of both classes of histone variants, we will use RNAi to knock down the function of key chromatin regulators in Drosophila cell lines and in whole C. elegans at different developmental stages. Transcriptional profiling after knock-down of the variants and their assembly machines will provide functional validation of roles that they play in gene regulation, and histone variant profiling after knock-down should help to identify target genes. Together with other types of genome-wide information our histone variant maps are likely to contribute to a fuller understanding of epigenetic regulatory elements in the genomes of these two model organisms. Given that the same histone variants are thought to play similar roles in essentially all complex eukaryotes, our basic approach can be immediately applied to the human genome.

We currently have only a partial and biased view of the global 3\\'UTRs sequences (3\\'UTRome) for any metazoan and have even less information on the motifs in the 3\\'UTRs that are used by trans-acting factors to drive gene regulation. Yet, what is known reveals a high level of complexity where 3\\'UTRs are often tissue-specific or are subject to alternative splicing events that lead to 3\\'UTR sequence diversity that parallels the diversity seen within the coding region of the transcript. Small non-coding RNAs (eg. microRNAs) are a class of posttranscriptional regulators that function through motifs found in the 3\\'UTRs; however only a subset of 3\\'UTR::microRNA motifs are though to be known. MicroRNAs add to the previously established fundamental role of RNA-binding proteins known to regulate expression; however, even less is known about these protein-binding motifs. C. elegans provides an excellent model to reveal the DNA-encoded functional elements that drive these complex events in a system where the genome is completely mapped and where 3\\'UTRs are comparatively compact. We propose to build on our preliminary studies and use a combination of in vitro, in vivo and in silico approaches to identify most or all 3\\'UTRs and functional sequence elements within them. Specifically, we propose to use genome-wide RT-PCR-based strategies to identify all 3\\'UTRs in C. elegans; to use computational approaches, microarray analysis and deep sequencing to reveal the vast majority of 3\\'UTR::microRNA binding motifs and use RIP-CHIP, Yeast-3-Hybrid and computational analysis to map the 3\\'UTR::RNA-binding-Protein motifs.

Very little is known about how replication is coordinated with other nuclear processes such as transcription and chromatin modification. Although recent genomic studies have demonstrated a correlation between time of DNA replication and transcriptional activity, with actively transcribed regions of the genome being replicated early, the underlying mechanism driving this correlation remains unclear. Only by systematically characterizing the replication dynamics of a metazoan genome in multiple cell types will we be in a position to understand the mechanisms by which these processes are coordinated to maintain genomic stability.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] We will use high-density genomic tiling-path arrays to characterize fully the Drosophila replication program in multiple cell lines and tissues. Specifically, we will determine the time of replication for all unique sequences in Drosophila genome, identify and map all functional origins of replication, and identify all sites of prereplicative complex (preRC, an essential multi-protein complex required for replication initiation) assembly. The high-resolution mapping of sites of preRC assembly will enable us to apply computational approaches (including comparative genomics) to identify potential sequence motifs that direct and regulate preRC function. Finally, we will also characterize the differential replication of polytene chromosomes in fully differentiated Drosophila tissues to identify genomic regions that are amplified or underreplicated. The differential replication of polytene chromosomes provides a unique opportunity to understand how developmental cues and chromosomal domains influence the replication program.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] In proliferating cells, duplication of the genome is a critical cell-cycle event, not only must the genome be copied accurately; it must also be copied exactly once. The regulation of origin selection and activation is essential to maintain genomic stability. The failure to completely replicate the genome or the inappropriate over-replication of select sequences may lead to tumorigenesis.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Because diabetes is determined by both genetic and environmental factors, a better understanding of the etiology of diabetes requires a careful investigation of gene-environment interactions.  The Nurses? Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals? Follow-up Study (HPFS) are well-characterized cohort studies of women and men for whom stored blood and DNA samples are available as well as detailed information on dietary and lifestyle variables. Using these unparalleled resources, our group has established an excellent track record of documenting important dietary, lifestyle, biochemical, and genetic risk factors for T2D. Thus, we are well-positioned to respond to the RFA ?Genome-wide association studies in the genes and environment initiative ? Study Investigators (U01)? (RFA-HG-06-033). The specific aims of this application include: 1. To conduct a GWA study among 3,000 cases of T2D and 3,000 healthy controls in NHS/HPFS cohorts. 2. To use information on the joint effects of genes and a list of carefully selected environmental exposures at the initial screening stage to test gene-environment interactions. This approach optimizes our power to detect variants that have a sizeable marginal effect and those with a small marginal effect but a sizeable effect in a stratum defined by an environmental exposure. To achieve this aim, we have developed a joint test of genetic marginal effect and gene-environment interaction. This flexible two-degree-of-freedom test generally provides greater  power than standard methods and has the potential to uncover both marginal genetic effects and stratum-specific effects. To meet the data sharing requirement of the RFA, we plan to submit relevant dietary and lifestyle data to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) on members of the nested case-control studies in the NHS/HPFS. One of the main strengths is the availability of comprehensive, validated environmental exposures in large well-characterized cohort studies for which stored blood and DNA samples are available. We believe that the unprecedented resources generated from this project will be extremely beneficial to the research community.',\n",

For the proposed research, we will add an additional 1,100 incident CHD cases (a total of 1,700 CHD cases) and an additional 1,000 CRS individuals (a total of 2,400 CRS individuals) for the same genome-wide collection of SNPs to identify environment-specific genetic effects influencing incident CHD. The already-funded grant is only powered for main effects; this new opportunity allows the study to be powered for interaction effects. We will perform a combination of computer science and sliding window haplotype analyses which directly incorporate gene-environment interaction effects to identify SNP-environmental combinations that predict incident CHD. Replication of initial findings will be done by investigating the concordance of \"statistical significance and direction of effect\" between the top 10,000 (~2%) SNPs from ARIC and the top 10,000 SNPs from analyses of gene-environment interaction effects in the Framingham Heart Study. For those SNPs that consistently replicate throughout, we will genotype the remainder of the ARIC cohort (-11,900 individuals) so that the full spectrum of environmental and phenotypic variation is represented in initial follow-up analyses. The CRS provides an ideal cost effective opportunity for initial studies to use GWA methods to investigate gene-environment interactions for other heart, lung and blood phenotypes. We will begin to identify genes influencing other heart, lung and blood phenotypes using the CRS and the 500,000 SNP dataset. Finally, we will support further analysis and discovery by sharing the data and analysis algorithms with other scientists in a timely fashion. This project will bring together appropriate population-based samples, good phenotyping, details on environmental measures and state-of-the art analyses to identify environment-specific genetic effects influencing CHD, along with other heart, lung and blood phenotypes. Identification of these environment-specific genetic effects will improve risk prediction and shed light on novel biological pathways bridging health and disease.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low and high birth weights are a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and epidemiological data have established an association between birth weight and later risk of adult metabolic disease. Fetal growth is determined by complex interactions between fetal genes and the maternal uterine environment. Subtle or overt variation in maternal glucose tolerance which is, in part, genetically determined, is related to fetal size at birth. New emerging data suggest that genetic variation in the fetus can impact maternal metabolism. Given the above, we are hypothesizing that during pregnancy, gene-environment interactions in the context of the maternal-fetal unit impact fetal size at birth and maternal metabolism. To address this hypothesis, we are proposing to perform genome wide association (GWA) mapping on a subset of ~37,000 DNA samples that were collected from mothers and their offspring as part of the NIH-funded Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study. HAPO is a multicenter, international study in which high quality phenotypic data related to fetal growth and maternal glucose metabolism has been collected from 25,000 pregnant women of varied racial and sociodemographic backgrounds using standardized protocols that were uniform across centers. We are proposing to genotype 1,500 infants and their mothers of European descent to accomplish the following specific aims: (1) To apply analytic approaches for conducting GWA mapping studies on quantitative phenotypes related to offspring size at birth (birth weight, ponderal index, head circumference and adiposity) allowing for other known influences such as gestational age, parity, and maternal weight gain. (2) To apply the above approaches to identify genetic variation that impacts maternal glucose tolerance at ~28 weeks of gestation (fasting glucose, glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test, and insulin sensitivity expressed as quantitative traits) allowing for other known influences such as maternal weight gain, parity and age. (3) To examine the interaction between maternal genes, the intrauterine environment, and fetal genes to identify interactions that modulate genetic regulation of size at birth and fetal genetic variation that impacts on maternal glucose tolerance. A replication study will be performed in additional infants and mothers of European descent with follow-up studies also planned in Afro-Caribbeans, Hispanics of Mexican descent and Thais.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Addiction to alcohol and illicit drugs is the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States. It is well known that genetic factors play a major role in the development of addiction, and many of these factors appear to contribute to a generalized liability for addiction. However, environmental factors also play important roles, and there is abundant evidence that a number of environmental factors may alter the effect of genetic risk factors. Hence, it is critical to approach addictive disease using a gene-environment approach.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] We propose to undertake a comprehensive genome-wide association study using nearly 3,000 unrelated subjects of European descent in a case-control design and to analyze genetic associations and gene x environment interactions. Cases include 1,333 subjects with the primary phenotype of DSM-IV alcohol dependence, and often with other comorbid drug addiction. Controls comprise 1,647 subjects who have used alcohol, but have never been addicted to alcohol, nicotine, or other illicit substances. This approach to control status will ensure that genetic findings are related to substance dependence, rather than the initiation of substance use. The large number of subjects is made feasible by a cross-study collaboration involving three major studies of addictive disorders: the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), the Family Study of Cocaine Dependence (FSCD), and the Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND). All these studies participate in the NIAAA and NIDA Genetic Repositories.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Our primary goals of this proposal are to undertake large-scale genotyping through the Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI) sequencing center, to standardize and harmonize phenotypic and environmental variables across all studies, and to perform a logical and sequential set of analyses that will incorporate covariates and environmental features for the testing of genetic association, gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. Finally, we will seek to replicate and extend findings from this genome-wide association study in an African-American population with over 1300 subjects (760 cases and 485 controls). Other independent and genetically informative datasets, including two data sets collected by COGA, and three large data sets held by collaborating investigators, provide the opportunity to further investigate genetic findings.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] This study will be the first to systematically address both genetic and environmental effects in addiction to using a genome-wide association approach; novel features include the integration of multiple large-scale data sets, a carefully considered definition of control status, and the opportunity for replication in several independent samples.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Preterm labor resulting in the delivery of a premature infant is a complex problem with an enormous impact on individuals, families and society. 500,000 children will be born prematurely in the U.S. this year, and worldwide 5 million will die of prematurity and its complications. It is the single largest contributor to DALYs, disability adjusted life years, a measure of the lifetime impact of a disease. Despite the importance of the problem and its disproportionate occurrence in poor and minority populations, insufficient resources have been targeted to discover its underlying etiology. The largest single cause of prematurity is spontaneous preterm labor, and suspected triggers for this include infection, stress, poor nutrition and genetic factors. Numerous family and twin studies provide strong evidence that genetic factors underlie about 40% of the risk for prematurity. The single best predictor for preterm delivery is a previous preterm birth. A major challenge in studying genetic factors in prematurity is that the risk could reside either in the mother and her uterus or in the infant/placenta. Thus, any approach to studying preterm birth should account for both infant and maternal risk, environmental covariates and interactions. The Danish National Birth Cohort Study is a well established, prospective cohort study that has the advantage of enrolling women early in pregnancy when the outcome is still unknown, so that bias in data collection and sampling is minimized. The Danish study has followed over 96,000 women beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy and has extensive biological and epidemiologic data on the outcomes of both mother and child. In this proposal, we will do a genome-wide case/control analysis using 1,000 very well characterized cases of spontaneous preterm birth, with biological samples on the mother and infant, drawn from the Danish National Birth Cohort Study. These will be matched to 1,000 mother/infant controls, born at 39 or 40 weeks gestation. Extensive epidemiologic variables will be used as covariates in the analysis. To replicate positive findings, we can access the deep resource of additional controls from the same Danish National Birth Cohort Study as well as more than 1,000 mother/father/preterm infant triads available from a large sample collection in the United States, and a further 1,000 U.S. case/controls enriched for African-Americans, a population known to have high rates of preterm labor. Positive results involving environmental factors can be further investigated, as the Danish cohort has maternal serum samples from early and mid pregnancy, as well as additional epidemiologic and outcome data. The study should enable a better understanding of the biology of parturition, identify common genetic factors that play a role in prematurity and suggest environmental modifications that can prolong gestations, with the goal of improving both neonatal and adult outcomes.

We propose to identify genes whose effects are modified in the presence of smoking. We will focus on young-onset stroke (i.e., stroke onset before age 56), in whom genetic factors and smoking-associated risk may play an even larger role. A two-stage approach will be used, beginning with a genome-wide association study in 929 young-onset stroke cases and 936 controls accrued from population-based case-control studies at the University of Maryland over the past 20 years. The 1% most strongly associated SNPs will then be genotyped in the Stage 2 replication set, which will utilize 1,853 young-onset cases and 1,199 controls contributed by 9 participating sites from the International Stroke Genetics Consortium. In addition to its focus on young-onset stroke, our study has the strength of including both women and men, and African-Americans and Whites. The proposed study will complement studies of older stroke patients and will be a continuing resource for understanding the genetic basis of stroke risk and how this risk is modified by smoking.  Lay summary: Stroke, defined as acute vascular disease of the brain, is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of major disability. The long-range goal of our research is to characterize the genetic and environmental basis for stroke susceptibility in order to develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies.

A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome. The data generated in this project will be the first systematic functional analysis of TF binding sites at base-pair resolution.   [unreadable]   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Eukaryotic organisms depend on the actions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) for successful post-transcriptional control gene expression and they provide the link between transcriptional and translational regulation, playing essential roles in many regulatory processes including transcription, splicing, export, stability and translation. The comprehensive identification of cis-regulatory elements residing in expressed RNA is fundamental to the NIH/NHGRI ENCODE project but is extremely limited at the present time.  Previously we developed methods for purifying endogenous RBP-RNA complexes and identifying the associated RNA targets using whole genome expression array technologies (termed ribonomics). This advance enabled the large-scale identification of many mRNA targets of RBPs and provided new insight into the principles governing posttranscriptional gene regulation. Our studies demonstrated that, analogous to transcriptional regulation, groups of functionally related RNAs are coordinately regulated in a combinatorial manner by distinct classes of RBPs by targeting related cis-regulatory elements located in the transcripts. As part of an earlier ENCODE technology grant, we improved our technology by developing a RIP-Chip tiling-array based assay that incorporates a digestion step to facilitate the identification of targeted cis-regulatory elements/RBPbinding sites. Using this method, the objective of this project is to comprehensively catalog the cis regulatory elements/RBP-binding sites CREBS present in expressed ENCODE mRNA using the five ENCODE cell lines and several cellular perturbations. This will be accomplished by (1) characterizing the genome-wide associations of expressed mRNA with a set of representative set of RBPs using ribonomic profiling and whole-genome expression arrays; (2) identifying the CREBS of the subset of ENCODE expressed mRNAs using tiling-array based RIP-Chip; (3) verifying and further increasing the resolution of predicted ENCODE cis-regulatory elements/RBP-binding sites using bioinformatics followed by quantitative Real-Time PCR and (4) biologically validating the function and RBP-binding activity of identified CREBS using a reporter assay. ln summary, we will use RNA-binding proteins to identify RNA based cis-regulatory elements / RBP-binding sites in the ENCODE sequence of the human genome.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is enormous potential for genome-wide association (GWA) studies to lead to advances in biomedical and clinical research and in translational medicine. By establishing a consensus set of measures for GWA studies, this project will increase the collective impact of these studies and lead to a better understanding of the function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. GWA studies provide a unique opportunity to identify relationships between genotype and phenotype. This genetic information can provide clues to the etiology of the disease, thus leading to the development of more effective methods of risk stratification and suggesting new targets for the development of therapeutics and prophylactics. However, a major impediment to realizing the full potential of GWA studies has been the lack of consistent measures within and across biomedical domains. The proposed work will result in the selection of high-priority phenotypic and environmental exposure measures for up to 20 biomedical domains. Effective consensus building is vital to the success of this project. Domains will be prioritized and selected according to a set of criteria that will be established at the outset of the project. Criteria for domain selection may include the expected impact of a GWA study on biomedical research in that domain, known or hypothesized environmental effects on gene expression, potential for translation to clinical research, and overall effect on global health. Working groups of domain experts will reach consensus on 10 to 15 high-priority measures for each domain. The resulting cumulative GWA Tool Set will consist of up to 300 clearly specified measures, a relevant subset of which can be selected for any specific GWA study. Efforts will be made to ensure that the chosen measures will respect and build on existing standards and that common data elements will be defined. The GWA Tool Set will provide supplementary components that will be helpful to researchers who are planning a GWA study, including core bioinformatics support. Input from the wide range of biomedical domain experts who will be gathered for consensus building will be used to develop a preliminary specification for a GWA study data analysis environment. A web portal will facilitate communication between and among groups throughout the project, providing reference materials to domain experts and an open forum to facilitate discussions and consensus building. A web-based survey will be implemented to efficiently expand the consensus building process and help attain broad acceptance in the biomedical research community. A strategy is proposed for managing the challenging meeting logistics required for an effective consensus building process. In addition, we present a multifaceted approach to disseminating the results of this project that includes the use of the Internet and submission of presentations and publications to a variety of contributors to the consensus building process.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Myocardial infarction (Ml) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) pose an enormous public health burden and there is an urgent need to develop new strategies for their prevention and treatment. Both are manifestations of atherosclerotic vascular disease yet differ in risk factor profiles and clinical presentation. A major aim of this proposal is to identify novel genetic determinants of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Discovering such determinants will lead to new strategies for identifying high-risk subjects who would benefit from aggressive intervention to prevent Ml and PAD and uncover novel etiologic pathways that may serve as targets for new therapies. We will leverage a biorepository of blood samples in 750 Ml and 750 PAD cases and corresponding controls, genotyping performed by NHGRI, and phenotypes and environmental exposures extracted from Mayo\\'s EMR and mapped to standard data formats such as HL7 and CHI standard vocabularies such as SNOMED and RxNorm; we will validate this process against humanly curated phenotype data on both cohorts. We will also serialize this data to facilitate conventional row-oriented analyses tools such as SAS or R.  Since genomic data cannot be meaningfully de-identified or anonymized, we will engage extensively with research participants and the community regarding best practices to weigh the future benefits of genomic research to patients, families, and the society, against the potential risks. A systematic examination of patient consenting practices and patient understanding will inform our ethical conduct of research and foster community engagement with the genomic research agenda. We will develop and refine our consenting procedures in collaboration with Mayo\\'s IRB on the basis of our findings, through an \"Ethics Incubator\" developed as part of Mayo\\'s Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA). A combination of in-depth patient interviews, consenting \"experiments\", and community engagement using Deliberative Democracy methods will be employed.  We will make anonymized phenotype annotations for consenting patients available for scientific access through methods to be defined by the NHGRI Cooperative Agreement steering committee. We will analyze whether genotypes at -500,000 SNP loci across the genome, supplied by NHGRI, are associated with two distinct phenotypes of atherosclerotic vascular disease: Ml and PAD. Further, we will investigate how environmental and lifestyle measures (e.g., smoking), identified from the Mayo EMR, modify the observed relationship between genotype and the atherosclerotic vascular disease phenotypes (i.e., gene-environment interactions). We will also investigate whether gene-gene interactions influence susceptibility to Ml and PAD.   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

The Vanderbilt EMR is a state of the art clinical and research tool (that includes >1.4 million records), and is associated with a DNA repository which has been in development for over 3 years; these are the key components of VGER, the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records project proposed here. The VGER model acquires DNA from discarded blood samples collected from routine patient care, and can link these to de-identified data extracted and readily updated from the EMR. The phenotype we will analyze here is the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram, since slow conduction (indicated by longer QRS duration) is a marker of arrhythmia susceptibility. This will not only exploit the power of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) approaches to generate new biologic knowledge that impacts an area of public health concern, but also provides a platform for the development of tools, such as Natural Language Processing approaches, to optimally mine EMRs. This project brings together a team of investigators with nationally recognized records of accomplishment in genome science, medical ethics, bioinformatics, de-identification science, and translational and cardiovascular medicine to address four Specific Aims: (1) perform a GWA comparing samples from subjects with QRS durations at the extremes of the normal range, and validate by genotyping high likelihood associations in prospectively ascertained clinical trial sets for QRS duration and for arrhythmia susceptibility; (2) evaluate the validity and utility of structured and unstructured components of EMR data for genome-phenome correlations; (3) assess the ethical, scientific, and societal advantages and disadvantages of the VGER model, and determine best practices for oversight, community involvement, and communication as the resource grows; and (4) develop and evaluate formal privacy protection models for data derived from databanks and EMRs, establishing data sharing and integration practices. We also include here a proposal to develop the Administrative Coordinating Center whose mission will be to facilitate communication and collaboration among nodes in this network, the NHGRI, and external advisors. We subscribe to a vision of Personalized Medicine in which genomic and other patient-specific information drives personalized, predictive, preemptive, and participatory health care, and VGER represents an important step in that direction.

A secondary goal is to build upon the existing infrastructure necessary to further subsequent genome wide studies, positioning the PMRP biobank as a national resource. Lipid abnormalities and cataracts are both diseases of public health significance, they share common risk factors (and prevention or management with statins), and they are both complex diseases which likely have many genes contributing to disease development. Whole genome association studies with these two outcomes and environmental risk factors could yield novel data about the etiology of the two separate outcomes as well as their interaction. The specific aims of the study are as follows: 1a) to develop and validate two primary outcomes, low HDL and cataract, in the Marshfield Clinic PMRP, and to quantify the impact of two environmental factors (cigarette smoking and statin use) known to influence each of the primary study outcomes, 1b) to evaluate the validity of electronic algorithms developed in the context of different electronic medical records in the Marshfield Clinic EMR, 1c) in conjunction with the other funded sites, to develop standards for electronic phenotyping, 2) to conduct community consultation activities, define issues essential to the appropriate conduct of whole genome association studies, and maximize data sharing without compromising data security or confidentiality, 3a) elucidate combinations of genetic markers that predispose subjects to the development of cataract, 3b) further our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying low circulating levels of HDL cholesterol, and 3c) quantify the degree to which low HDL levels contribute to the onset and progression of cataracts in this population-based cohort, and to parse the genetic risk factors identified through whole genome scanning as being contributory to either low HDL cataract, or both, and explore gene/environment interaction with cigarette smoking and statin use. These aims will be studied in a nested case control study of 4220 cases (3037 low HDL, 1609 cataract surgery, 426 with both conditions) and 1481 controls aged 55 and older who have neither condition and have been screened for both conditions in the past five years. Quarterly meetings of the PMRP Community Advisory Group and quarterly newsletters will be used to engage and inform the public about this whole genome association study and the sharing of data with the wider research community. Multi-factor dimensionality reduction analyses will be used to prioritize SNPs for replication in other cohorts. The strength of the research team and the depth and breadth of the electronic medical record at the Marshfield Clinic make this the ideal setting for this RFA.

Associating natural genetic variation with health status requires large numbers of individual human genomes that are well annotated with respect to health status. The goal of this application is to test the hypothesis that biorepositories coupled to electronic medical records (EMRs) can provide these well annotated samples and that they can produce gene associations similar to purpose developed cohorts. NUgene is a biorepository linked to EMR developed phenotypes collected with a broad consent that allows assessment of individual genetic variation, mining of EMRs for phenotypes, and the use of this data for establishing correlations between phenotypes and genotypes. Specifically we propose to: (1) assess the extent, quality and utility of data obtained from medical records to identify cases of asthma and diabetes as well as controls for genome wide association studies (GWAS); (2) evaluate the appropriateness of our consent for GWAS and data sharing; (3) evaluate our data sharing plan and align it with standards as they are developed; (4) develop and disseminate best practices for collecting, formatting, and documenting of phenotypic and genotype data in consultation with participants, IRBs, investigators and the community; (5) characterize and evaluate the representativeness and diversity of NUgene participants in relationship to individuals receiving healthcare through Northwestern's health care affiliates, the Chicagoland area and the US population; (6) perform GWAS on NUgene DNA cases and controls to compare genetic variations associated with diabetes and asthma in our population with previous GWAS on more traditionally defined collections of diabetes and asthma cases. With the active engagement of stakeholders including the community, research investigators and regulatory and compliance experts we will evaluate and develop best practices for studying genetic contributions to health and disease using participants enrolled in the course of their health care. These studies will contribute to our understanding of diabetes and asthma and will produce recommendations for improvements in EMRs that will improve their utility for research and set the stage for integration of genomic information and EMRs with the goal of achieving the vision of personalized medicine.

The ENCODE project is a large multi center project which aims to define all the functional elements in the human genome. This will be achieved using many different experimental techniques coupled with numerous computational techniques. A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity. We also expect to apply machine learning techniques to build integration methods combining datasets. These included Bayesian based inference methods and the robust computer science technique of Support Vector Machines. Each of these methods have performed well in the ENCODE pilot project and we expect them to be even more useful in the full ENCODE project. We will also provide quality assurance and summary metrics of genome-wide multiple alignments. This area has a number of complex statistical, algorithmic and engineering issues, which we will solve using state of the art techniques. Overall we aim to provide deep integration of the ENCODE data, under the direction of the AWG and in tight collaboration with the other members of the ENCODE consortium.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among men. Risk factors for prostate cancer have remained elusive and aside from age, having a family history of the disease or African ancestry, until recently, no genetic or non-genetic (i.e. lifestyle) risk factors have been consistently demonstrated to contribute to variation in disease risk in the population. Over the past year, we contributed to the first reproducible genetic risk factor for prostate cancer at 8q24. Through fine-mapping of 8q24 in five racial/ethnic populations in the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC), we identified three regions that contain 7 independent risk variants for prostate cancer. Only some of these variants were found in studies conducted in European Whites, thus, emphasizing the power of genetic studies in multiple racial/ethnic populations to reveal a more complete spectrum of variants associated with disease risk. In this application, we propose to work with the GEI-GWA Steering Committee to identify genetic factors that contribute to prostate cancer by performing a well-powered genome-wide association study among African American, Japanese American, Native Hawaiian, Latino and European American men in the MEC. More specifically, we propose the genotyping of approximately 1,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and >940,000 probes to detect copy number variation in 3,750 prostate cancer cases and 3,750 controls, to identify pan-ethnic genetic variants that affect risk in all five racial/ethnic populations, as well as important ethnic-specific variation. In this multi-ethnic dataset, we will also examine interaction between associated variants, environmental factors (thereby better defining the role of these factors) and disease severity, as well as explore the causes of heterogeneity of genetic effects across populations. We have also established collaborations with other prostate cancer researches to replicate the ethnic-specific associations observed in this GWA study in minority populations. We expect this work to significantly advance knowledge of the etiology of prostate cancer across these racial/ethnic populations, guiding the development of future preventive, early detection, prognostic and even therapeutic measures.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an age-related, intraocular pressure (lOP)-dependent progressive optic neuropathy that ultimately leads to blindness. Permanent vision loss from POAG is a condition of public health significance. Current evidence suggests that POAG is a polygenetic disease modified by environmental influences. We hypothesize that the identification and characterization of POAG susceptibility genes via a genome-wide association study (GWAS) will reveal significant environmental determinants that influence the disease process, as well as a better understanding of how gene-environment and gene-gene interactions contribute to this complex disease. For this study we have formulated a case-control study population from three cohorts: the Nurses Health Study (NHS); Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS); and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI). The cohort consists of 1200 cases and 1200 controls with DMA. Members of the NHS and HPFS also have repeated environmental exposure data over a 16 to 24 year period. We will perform a single-stage GWAS and carry out the appropriate statistical analyses to find genetic markers with the strongest association with POAG. Our replication plan to confirm the top genetic markers will involve a comparable population of 1400 cases and 1400 controls, a significant subset of which will also have repeated environmental exposure data. As part of this study, we will submit data on a myriad of environmental exposures (from members of NHS and HPFS) that could modify genetic predisposition for POAG to a central data repository. These results will generate a valuable collection of genotype, phenotype and environment exposure data, allowing scientists to test numerous hypotheses regarding how genes and environment relate to incident POAG. This study is also a crucial first step toward a better understanding of the underlying pathology responsible for POAG and will lead to future proposals to examine the relevance of the significant variants found in the Caucasian population in an African American admixture study, perform fine mapping and re-sequencing of candidate genes in at-risk populations, and investigate gene-gene interactions in POAG. Discovery of the various combinations of gene and environment interactions involved in POAG could lead to genotype-specific primary prevention strategies for this disease.

It is a primary or contributing cause of death in over 11 % of the total number of deaths, and accounted for an estimated $66.4 billion in healthcare costs in 2007.  Blood pressure rises steadily throughout life. Therefore, discovering the molecular factors that underlie blood pressure ontogeny may be fundamental to understanding hypertension. The proposed research represents a collaborative effort to use existing specimens, high-quality phenotypic data on cardiovascular disease risk factors, and state-of-the-art analytical methods to identify and replicate genetic effects influencing longitudinal cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors profiles, with a special emphasis on blood pressure, and to characterize their interactions with relevant environmental factors, specifically body weight profiles, physical fitness, psychosocial influences, and dietary intake. These goals are fundamental to developing new approaches to detection, treatment, and prevention of high blood pressure and its associated CVD consequences. The primary setting is that of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), a prospective, multi-center investigation of the natural history and etiology of cardiovascular disease in 5,115 African-Americans and Whites 18-30 years old at the time of initial examination. We propose to conduct whole genome association analyses on 1,930 African-American and 2,064 white CARDIA participants with available DNA to identify an assumed 15-20 genes associated with inter-individual variation in blood pressure profiles during the critical transition period from young adulthood to early middle-age. Replication of results will be facilitated through collaborations with the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study, the Rochester Family Heart Study (RFHS), and the Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS). The CARDIA cohort provides a unique opportunity to examine the context-dependent effects of genetic variation influencing CVD risk factors profiles, by virtue of the extensive data on lifestyle, behavior, and physiologic risk factors collected from young adulthood to early middle-age, a period when the development and progression of CVD accelerates, but when few clinically recognized events have occurred, minimizing confounding effects of drugs associated with treatment of such events, or potential bias due to CVD-related death of the participants.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Our overall long-term goal is to determine the etiology of the common and complex (multifactorial) disease, venous thromboembolism (VTE), by focusing on genetic and environmental factors that increase the risk of VTE, and the interactions among these factors. VTE is a common disease with over 900,000 incident or recurrent events in the U.S. annually; of these, almost one-third are fatal. To improve survival and avoid complications, VTE must be prevented. However, previous efforts to prevent VTE have been stymied because most individuals with known environmental (clinical) risk factors for VTE do not develop VTE. We hypothesize that, among those exposed to a clinical risk factor(s), a genetic predisposition distinguishes those who do from those who do not develop VTE. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that VTE segregates in families due to heritability. VTE follows a complex mode of inheritance involving polygenes and environmental exposure. Our specific aims are: (1) to perform a genome wide association (GWA) screen and analysis using the 1M SNP platform specified by NHGRI genotyping facilities; (2) to test a)whether environmental exposures modify the observed relationship between genotype and VTE (geneenvironment interaction); and b) whether gene-gene interactions influence susceptibility to VTE; and 3) to test whether SNPs associated with VTE are located within or adjacent to genes that are functionally linked using pathway analysis. We currently have stored DNA samples from 829 VTE cases and 478 controls that are available for sharing with NHGRI, and by July 1, 2008, we project that we will have DNA samples from 1300 cases and 1300 controls. For all cases and controls, data on environmental exposures that are independent risk factors for VTE were collected with a standardized instrument. These data are stored in a SAS database by unique patient study number identifier and can be easily and rapidly shared. Using state of the art statistical genetic methods, we will identify genetic variants associated with VTE, including interactions. We will make the resulting data rapidly and widely available for research use and work collaboratively to share experience and expertise across participating biorepositories. Our results will have potentially great clinical utility by allowing physicians to stratify patients exposed to clinical risk factors into high- and low-VTE risk, identify unexposed patients at risk, and better target prophylaxis.

Tobacco use is a major environmental risk factor in the development of COPD; however, only 10-20% of smokers develop symptomatic disease. Animal and human studies provide support for the role of genetic factors for both smoking behavior and its associated outcomes, including lung function and other manifestations of COPD, yet only a small proportion of potentially causal genes have been identified. The Lung Health Study (LHS), a 14.5-year, multicenter, randomized clinical trial aimed to determine whether a program of smoking intervention and use of an inhaled bronchodilator can slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function or alter COPD mortality, represents one of the largest COPD cohorts worldwide (N=5,887). As part of a previous NHLBI-funded study, we developed a DNA repository including >4,800 LHS participants. We plan to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for COPD and associated quantitative traits in this well-characterized cohort and use existing GWAS datasets to validate our findings. Because we also hypothesize that some genes may contribute to nicotine addiction and thus tobacco use (the strongest environmental risk factor in COPD), we will test for association between genetic markers and this outcome, and will similarly validate those findings, and test for gene-environment interaction. A major strength of our application is the collaborative effort with colleagues at the James Hogg iCAPTURE Center for Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Research in Vancouver, and the LHS Data Coordinating Center at the University of Minnesota. Additional collaborations with investigators conducting GWAS in relevant datasets include those from Harvard University (the Framingham Health Study, the National Emphysema Treatment Trial/Normative Aging Study), University of Washington (the Cardiovascular Health Study), University of North Carolina (Tobacco and Genetics Network), and University of Toronto (Smoking Treatment for Ontario Patients Study). Goals of this study are: (1) to perform GWAS in European American and African American LHS subjects using a genome-wide array of 550,000 SNPs, with individual rate of decline of lung function and COPD susceptibility as the primary outcome phenotypes; (2) to cross-validate significant associations using existing GWAS data in independent populations; (3) to test for gene-environment interactions using markers associated with COPD outcomes, with a particular focus on tobacco use; and (4) to perform tests for association between the markers and outcomes reflecting nicotine addiction (e.g. sustained quitters vs. continuous smokers), and to validate significant associations in a replicate population. Findings from this study will provide a better understanding of the complex pathways related to risk of COPD and its associated phenotypes.   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fueled by the decreased costs of genotyping technologies, over the last couple of years many genome-wide association studies have reported associations of genetic variants with complex diseases and traits, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and obesity. As many of these associations have been repeatedly confirmed in large studies, we can consider them \"putative genuine variants\". However, before these genes can be put to clinical use, important questions need to be answered, including how these genes interact with the environment, how their risk differs in disease subtypes and ethnical groups, and how they impact intermediate phenotypes. To fully examine the profile or \"epidemiologic architecture\" we will comprehensively evaluate such putative genuine variants in the Women\\'s Health Initiative (WHI) Clinical Trial (CT) (n=68,132) and Observational Study (OS) (n=93,676). The WHI is one of the most definitive, far reaching population-based trials of post-menopausal women\\'s health ever undertaken. This large study population not only enables us to examine the population incidence for racial and ethnic subgroups and associated risks of rigorously defined, incident diseases (specific aim 1) but allows us to investigate associated risks given in-depth information on various environmental exposures and disease risk factors as well as three randomized interventions (hormone therapy; low-fat dietary modification; calcium + vitamin D supplements) (specific aim 2). The prospective and longitudinal collection of biospecimens, intermediate outcomes, and phenotypic characteristics, such as bone mineral density, hormone concentrations, breast density, or inflammation will further permit us to link genetic variants to relevant intermediate phenotypes, which will potentially provide important clues to the biological basis of the genuine associations (specific aim 3). For a variety of outcomes we will genotype within this 4-year project 72,000 participants for about 50 disease-specific putative genuine variants and 50 ancestral informative markers. Information generated from this study will be critical to determine the health impact of any given undisputable variant. Findings may also provide valuable insights into disease pathways and mechanisms, and targets for disease screening, prevention, and treatment. To facilitate a rapid utilization of these findings we will share results from this study with the scientific community and invite outside investigators to utilize the WHI resources.

Within the last few months, the literature has become inundated with reports of genome-wide association (GWA) studies identifying new genetic variations associated with phenotypes of public health interest. While the flurry of discovery is exciting, the usefulness of these new findings in a general population setting remains unclear. Therefore, the next steps beyond the initial GWA studies must provide population-based data on these initial associations before the most promising findings can be translated into improvements in intervention, prevention, and/or treatment options for the general population. The genetic component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES; n~20,000) can provide the data necessary to move beyond the initial GWA study discoveries. NHANES is a U.S. population-based, cross-sectional survey collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NHANES DNAs are linked to demographic, health, lifestyle, laboratory, extensive clinical, and physical examination data for participating individuals. Because participants are ascertained regardless of health status, NHANES is a rich resource for phenotypes (clinical endpoints and quantitative traits) and environmental exposures. With this large dataset, the epidemiologic architecture of GWA-identified genetic variations will be described, and association studies will be conducted to provide more accurate effect size estimates and population attributable fractions for many common diseases and traits such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and coronary artery disease. Finally, tests for gene-environment and nuclear mitochondrial gene interactions will be performed, the latter of which laboratory data will be generated to support the statistical association.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] The purpose of this grant is to provide evidence in population-based datasets that GWA-identified genetic variations are relevant to most people. As such, GWA-identified variations will be characterized and population-based statistics and data for modifiers of these variations will be released rapidly so that the most promising findings can be incorporated into future translational studies by the research community.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  NHGRI is developing a research program to identify and characterize genetic variants causally associated with complex human diseases in genome-wide association (GWA) and other genetic studies. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, the Department of Genetics at Rutgers University has convened a strong team of statistical geneticists, molecular genetics, genetic epidemiologists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized genetic epidemiologic resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on replication and characterization of causal variants by: (1) utilizing innovative computer and information science methodologies to retrieve and synthesize in a comprehensible form study results and descriptive data obtained from the analysis of association, phenotypic, covariate/exposure and population ancestry data, including the impact of particular interventions on a given genotype-phenotype association and the risk of a specific trait associated with a given variant; (2) serving as a data clearinghouse for disseminating results and descriptive data on the epidemiologic architecture of putative disease-associated genetic variants, including detailed and standardized characterizations of the participating population studies, in user-friendly and readily interpretable formats that will maximize the utilization of data population impact and potential gene function by the scientific community; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support to develop cyber platforms that will enable, stimulate and facilitate collaborations with outside investigators for future functional and translational research; and (4) serving as a centralized to facilitate, support and manage as needed program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies for GWAs and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC will be to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, thereby accelerating our understanding of the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In response to RFA-HG-07-014, we propose to use the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study to characterize the \"epidemiologic architecture\" of putative causal variants identified in large-scale genomic association studies for a wide range of complex traits (chronic diseases, intermediate phenotypes and behavioral risk factors) across racial/ethnic populations. We have established a large biorepository of blood and urine (N=67,000) and cryopreserved lymphocytes (N=15,000) linked to extensive, prospectively collected risk factor (e.g., diet, smoking, physical activity), biomarker and clinical data, for five racial/ethnic groups in the MEC. This cohort study of over 215,000 men and women in Hawaii and California is unique in that it is population-based and includes large representations of older adults (45-75 yrs at baseline) for five US racial/ethnic groups (Japanese Americans, African Americans, European Americans, Latinos and Native Hawaiians) at varying risks of chronic diseases. We propose to study: 1) diseases for which we have DNA available for large numbers of cases and controls (breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, diabetes, and obesity); 2) important cancers that are less common (e.g., lung, pancreas, endometrial cancers, NHL) but for which we propose to pool our data with other funded groups; 3) common traits that are risk factors for these diseases (e.g., body mass index/weight, waist-to-hip ratio, height) and 4) relevant disease-associated biomarkers (e.g., fasting insulin and lipids, steroid hormones). Our specific aims are: 1) To determine the population-based epidemiologic profile (allele frequency, main effect, heterogeneity by disease characteristics) of putative causal variants in the five racial/ethnic groups in the MEC; 2) for variants displaying effect heterogeneity across ethnic/racial groups, we will utilize differences in LD to identify a more complete spectrum of associated variants at these loci; 3) investigate gene x gene and gene x environment interactions to identify modifiers; 4) examine the associations of putative causal variants with already measured intermediate phenotypes (e.g., plasma insulin, lipids, steroid hormones); and 4) for variants that do not fall within known genes, start to investigate their relationships with gene expression and epigenetic patterns in small genomic studies. We will coordinate the selection of these variants and endpoints, analytical methods, data analyses, and rapid reporting of results with other cohorts/clinical trials funded through this RFA.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genetic Epidemiology of Causal Variants Across the Life Course is submitted in response to RFA HG-07-014, as a consortium of well characterized population based studies and a central genotyping and resequencing core laboratory, to accelerate the understanding of the role and population impact of putative causal genetic variants related to complex diseases. This collaborative network includes six of the most informative and demographically diverse population-based studies extant, contributing approximately 58,000 men and women from the main ethnic and racial groups in the U.S., ranging in age from childhood to old adulthood. Those examined in the six studies are extensively characterized for a wide range of phenotypes and traits, and five studies have immediately available stored DNA of high quality for transfer to the core laboratory.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The participating studies include population based cohorts with repeat examinations and long term follow up and a national probability sample, with clinical and subclinical measurements on a range of health conditions, their precursors and natural history, characterized across the life course. This collaborative network is designed to provide optimal capabilities to estimate and replicate associations of genetic variants with complex diseases in diverse U.S. populations, in individual and environmental contexts of public health relevance, with power sufficient to identify associations, interactions, and population impact in subgroups.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] The team of investigators contributes epidemiologic, genetic, methodologic and subject-matter expertise and a demonstrated record of productivity in collaborative, interdisciplinary settings. The network builds on existing capabilities and the proven administrative channels of the assembled partner studies for efficient and timely access to phenotypic, exposure and contextual data, for analyses within each partner study and for replication across studies, and for rapid sharing of the resulting descriptive and association data. The investigators will serve as effective collaborators within the wider study, contributing methodologic innovation and analytic support and serving on committees and working groups set up by the Steering Committee.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] The collaborative resource assembled in this application will permit the estimation of the role and population impact of selected genetic variants in diversity-based populations, for an array of chronic diseases, their risk factors and intermediate outcomes, at different life epochs, and for groups defined by potentially modifiable contexts. Genomic assays will be conducted as needed to further characterize the reported associations.   [unreadable]   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human species is dependent for its survival upon the activities of billions of microorganisms that inhabit multiple environmental niches within and on the human body. The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) is an NIH Roadmap program designed to collect unprecedented amounts of data about the complexity of human microbial communities. The data will be generated by multiple HMP sequencing centers. To ensure that the data is maximally useful, a Data Analysis and Coordination Center (DACC) will be formed. This task will be accomplished via a multi-instiutional collaboration between five research groups with a history of close interactions, and extensive experience in a range of disciplines relevant to this project. The leaders of the five groups are: (i) Owen White, Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD; (ii) Victor Markowitz, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Berkeley, CA; (iii) Nikos Kyrpides, DOE-Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Walnut Creek, CA; (iv) Rob Knight, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado, Boulder CO; (v) Gary Anderson, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA. Construction of the DACC will be accomplished through these four specific aims: 1. Creation of a Human Microbiome Data Store (HMDS) which will contain all data collected from the HMP centers organized through standardized formats, controlled vocabularies, a Human Microbiome Project Catalog (HMPC) tracking system, and links to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). 2. Development of a Comprehensive Computational Analysis Pipeline which will consist of an initial core set of elements and will be expanded over time as new tools useful to metagenomic anlaysis are developed either at the DACC or elsewhere. 3. Development of a Data Integration and Analysis System (DAIS) to support Web-Based Analysis and which will employ numerous data reduction and integration systems as well as numerouse data exploration tools that will be based on similar existing resources such as those found in IMG and IMG/M. 4. Engage in community outreach and training via surveys of target user groups, workshops at relevant conferences, onsite training courses, and online tutorials and seminars. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The information generated from the HMP project will shed light on the complex communities that inhabit the human host. The importance of this cannot be overemphasized given the growing evidence of microbiotic influence upon human development, physiology, disease progression, immunity, and nutrition. The success of the HMP depends on the DACC to provide the specialized data management and analysis infrastructure which will facilitate discoveries about the microbiome that will lead to improvements in human health.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the practice of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), drug-eluting stents (DES) have become the de facto standard of care in the U.S. However, an intense controversy has emerged as it now appears that DES may significantly increase the late risk of stent thrombosis and all-cause mortality. This disturbing, yet unsubstantiated signal of compromised safety represents a potentially huge public health burden. Since initial approval of DES by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003, approximately one million patients in the US alone are treated annually with DES. Thus, even a small excess relative risk, if confirmed, could translate to hundreds if not thousands of excess deaths each year. Therefore, to better understand and provide information about the safety and effectiveness of DES, we propose to extend the follow-up (to 5 full years) of 4,290 recent PCI-treated patients (2004- 2006) from the ongoing National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Dynamic PCI Registry. This effort, coupled with existing long-term follow-up data of Dynamic Registry patients treated with bare-metal stents (BMS), will allow for a long-term evaluation of DES versus BMS in 'real-world' clinical practice. Importantly, this evaluation is not possible with extended follow-up of patients enrolled in the randomized clinical trials that led to FDA approval of DES because up to 60% of DES use today occurs in 'off-label' circumstances. Overall, the research aims are to: (1) Compare 5-year mortality and myocardial infarction between patients treated with DES versus BMS overall, within 'high-risk' subgroups, and by 'off-label' stent use; (2) Evaluate cardiac and non-cardiac causes of mortality among patients treated with DES versus BMS; (3) Compare 5-year mortality and repeat revascularization by the sirolimus-eluting versus paclitaxel-eluting stent overall, within 'high-risk' subgroups, and by 'off-label' stent use; and (4) Investigate mechanisms that contribute to stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, death, and repeat revascularization in patients treated with BMS and DES. In summary, by extending the active NHLBI Dynamic Registry, we propose to analyze long- term outcome data on several thousand PCI patients treated with BMS and DES. This effort will permit an objective and timely real world evaluation of whether the recent signal of a possible mortality hazard associated with use of DES is real, and whether the recent widespread adoption of DES into clinical practice needs to be significantly altered.

This application proposes to extend the SHS to pursue the following aims: 1) Expand the genetic studies that will emphasize the genome scan approach, but also include investigation of carefully selected candidate genes. The completed genome scan of 3776 members from 94 extended families will be used to identify quantitative trait loci and narrow the regions of interest by fine mapping. We also will examine a selected number of candidate genes that are difficult to exclude on the basis of linkage studies, but are of potential importance to vascular disease. 2) Continue the mortality and morbidity surveillance of the original cohort (approximately2859 male and female survivors, ages 60 - 89 years) and to initiate annual mortality surveillance and limited morbidity follow-up of the non-cohort family members. 3) Re-examine the family members so that changes in risk factors can be analyzed and genetic effects on changes estimated. Advantages of the SHS include: 1) It provides health data on an underserved ethnic group. 2) It is the largest, longest longitudinal study in the US of CVD and its risk factors in individuals with diabetes. 3) Data from cardiac, carotid, and popliteal ultrasound measures will substantially improve understanding of mechanisms of vascular disease in diabetes and the genetics of CVD. 4) This population includes a grouping which the epidemic of obesity and diabetes has impacted people at very young ages, permitting analysis of genetic and environmental effects on these conditions with limited confounding by age effects. SHS will lead to valuable therapeutic and prevention strategies for this and other populations in the US and the world, where the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and CVD are progressing rapidly. The relevance of this research to public health: The SHS studies diseases of the heart and blood vessels in American Indian Communities, in order to try to explain the rapid increases that have been recently observed. The study is attempting to learn about predictors of disease, and to see to what extent it runs in families. SHS is valuable because it provides information on how diabetes leads to diseases of the heart and blood vessels that will be useful in many populations who now have high rates of diabetes.

To date, the Program has carried out 21,600 physical examinations, assembled a shared database of 294 hypertension-relevant variables, measured quantitative echocardiograms on 7,321 individuals, carried-out genome-wide linkage analyses for hypertension status and 13 related phenotypes, published (or in press) 128 manuscripts and identified 5 hypertension susceptibility genes by following-up 4 linkage peaks. In the proposed next phase of the FBPP, a major emphasis is placed on making the Program a shared resource for hypertension researchers in the United States and throughout the world. In Aim 1, we will build, maintain and update a publicly available knowledge-base to facilitate research by non-FBPP investigators on the genetics of hypertension, its risk factors and its complications. In Aim 2, we will use state-of-the-art genetic linkage analysis methods to identify additional linkage regions using subgroups of pedigrees and physiologically relevant combinations of phenotypes that will aid in localizing hypertension genes. In Aim 3, we will use a combination of bioinformatics, a dense array of SNPs, and state-of-the-art  [unreadable] data analysis to follow-up regions of interest and identify the underlying hypertension genes. The regions to be followed-up include those identified during the current phase of the FBPP and Aim 2 of this renewal phase. In Aim 4, we will evaluate the hypertension genes identified in Aim 3 for their association with multiple measures reflecting the cardiovascular and renal complications of hypertension, including left ventricular mass and microalbuminuria. It is the long-term goal of the FBPP to have the hypertension genetics community develop a comprehensive picture of the genetic architecture of human hypertension, including its risk factors, complications, and response to treatment.

For this rapidly growing patient population with very poor prognosis and             quality of life, revascularization has been less beneficial than in                  nondiabetics. Using a factorial design, BARI II will compare revascularization       combined with aggressive medical anti-ischemia treatment to aggressive medical       anti-ischemia treatment alone; simultaneously, BARI II will compare two              glycemic control strategies, insulin sensitization versus insulin provision.         All patients will have target HbA1c values < 7.5%, and uniform control of            hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity following recommended guidelines.

The long-term objective and specific aims of this proposal are to classify all ECG documents associated with BARIII patients to identify baseline ECG predictors of long-term outcome, and to classify all myocardial infarct/ischemic events associatedwith the treatment strategies tested over 5 years of follow-up. Myocardial ischemic events will be classifed by serial ECG changes, cardiac enzyme abnormalities, and clinical symptoms. Myocardial infarction is defmedj as Q wave (symptomatic or silent detected during routine follow-up), non Q wave MI, or unstable angina associated with or without new ECG changes resulting in hospital admission; Serial ECG change will be detected using the Novacode, an ECG comparison program used in large scale clinical trials. Cardiac enzyme abnormalities will be classified using WHO criteria. The results of this proposal will allow determination of myocardial ischemic event rates in BARI II, a major study secondary endpoint. The rates of myocardial infarction and myocardial ischemic events leading to hospital admission will be compared in patients randomized to initial medical therapy or initial coronary revascularization, and to insulin providing diabetes treatment protocol vs. insulin sensitizing diabetes treatment protocol. The prognostic impact of baseline and subsequent new follow-up ECG changes will be determined for cardiac mortality and total mortality.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of the ACTION Trial is to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of exercise training for New York Heart Association Classes II-IV congestive heart failure patients in addition to standard of care versus a strategy of standard care alone. The secondary objective is to determine the incidence and significance of exercise-related complications, the effect on exercise tolerance and quality of life, and the cost-effectiveness of training.  The exercise training will include 36 facility-based training sessions followed by home-based exercise and interval facility sessions. Training will be at 60-70% of heart rate reserve. Patients randomized to the training arm will train by either walking or bicycle ergometers. Treadmills or exercise bicycles will be provided to training patients by the coordinating center, if desired. Effectiveness will be defined as the primary combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalizations.  The expected annual baseline rate is 30% for the control group. The expected non-adherence and drop-out rate is 35% the first year and 15% annually thereafter, with a cross-over rate of 5% per year. The regional center team and the coordinating center will implement multiple strategies to improve adherence in patients in the training arm. Using these assumptions, a total sample size of 3000 subjects will be required to detect a 20% reduction in the primary outcome with an alpha level of 0.05 and a power greater than 80%. If the non-adherence and drop-out rate decrease to 30% in the first year and 12.5% annually thereafter, the power to detect a 20% difference is greater than 90%. The primary analysis will be based on intent-to-treat.  The trial will take place over 5 years with an initial 6 months for planning, training, and implementation; 3 years of enrollment; 1 year of follow-up; and 6 months for close out, analysis, and presentation.',\n",
       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasing among Alaska Natives. The Genetics of Coronary Artery Disease in Alaska Natives (GOCADAN) study has been examining CVD and its risk factors by conducting a family genetic study among Eskimos residing in eight villages and the town of Nome in the Norton Sound Region. This application proposes to extend the GOCADAN study to pursue the following aims: 1) Expand the genetic studies that will emphasize the genome scan approach. The complete genome scan of 1,214 members, who are nearly all part of one extended pedigree, will be used to identify quantitative trait loci for subclinical CVD and CVD risk factors and narrow the regions of interest be fine mapping. 2) Re-examine the family members so that changes in risk factors can be analyzed and genetic effects on changes estimated. Surveillance for CVD events will be instituted, including annual mortality surveillance and follow-up of nonfatal events uncovered at the time of the re-exam.  Advantages of GOCADAN include: 1) It provides health data on an underserved ethnic group. 2) The large extended pedigree improves the chances of detecting significant loci for subclinical CVD and its risk factors. 3) Data from carotid ultrasound measures will improve understanding of mechanisms of vascular disease and the genetics of CVD. 4) A unique constellation of risk factors with low rates of several risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, but high levels of inflammation and rates of smoking, provides a population uniquely suited to examine the roles of inflammatory markers in CVD. GOCADAN will lead the valuable therapeutic and prevention strategies for this and other populations in the United States and the world, where the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and CVD are increasing rapidly.',\n",

Of immediate interest are risk factors and precursors such as lipid phenotypes, diabetes phenotypes, measures of obesity, measures associated with hemostasis, and measures of cardiac and arterial structure and function. In Phases III and IV of the Strong Heart Study (SHS), we have collaborated with the other SHS investigators in successfully recruiting and examining more than 1,200 members of extended families in each of three centers (in Arizona, Oklahoma, and the Dakotas). We have shown that many of the CVD-related phenotypes are heritable, and we will soon complete a 10centimorgan map that includes genotypes for 386 short tandem repeats (STRS) in each of the 3,600+individuals. In linkage screening of as many as 2,100 individuals, we have identified numerous chromosomal regions containing promising linkage signals: left ventricular mass normalized for height (chr 12p, LOD=5.3);weight (LOD=5.17) and body mass index (LOD=5.08) (chr 4q); plasma insulin level (LOD=3.5) and lean body mass (LOD=2.6) (chr 2p); ejection fraction (chr 1q, LOD=3.5); LDL-C (chr 10p, LOD=3.7); PAI-1 (chr 11p,LOD=3.03); and clusters of insulin resistance syndrome variables identified by factor analysis including factors for glucose/insulin/obesity (chr 4, LOD=2.2) and dyslipidemia (chr 12, LOD=2.7). We will continue our linkage analyses and will do finer scale mapping to more precisely localize quantitative trait loci (QTLs) within targeted chromosomal regions. This will involve prioritizing of candidate genes and extensive sequencing of multiple candidate genes within the region of each QTL to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and then SNP typing of all SNPs that we identify in candidate genes. Our analyses will enable us to test whether specific SNP polymorphism(s) account for our linkage signals. We also will test whether the SNPs account for population-level association in the SHS cohort. The use of new Bayesian methods will enable us to distinguish functional genes from polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with them and will greatly reduce the amount of time-consuming molecular genetic analysis that would otherwise be necessary to narrow in on functional polymorphisms.

Carotid exams in participants in SHS Phase IV showed substantial progression of atherosclerosis over 4 years and showed heritability of arterial size and stiffness. Phase IV echo's showed near doubling of 'LV hypertrophy and decline in LV function over 8 years from Phase II.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been estimated that as many as one-half of asthmatic patients do not respond to treatment with [unreadable]2-agonists, glucocorticoids, or leukotriene antagonists. The principle hypothesis of this proposal is that genetics can be used to predict whether an individual with asthma will have a beneficial vs. a poor response to specific asthma therapies. In support of this hypothesis, our laboratories have successfully used a genotype to phenotype candidate gene approach to identify genetic variants that are associated with treatment-specific responses to all three major classes of asthma therapeutics. Despite this success, no variation at the single SNP or haplotypic level in any single gene has been discovered that can explain a large enough proportion of the phenotypic variance to be clinically predictive for any asthma drug. Thus, the major goal of this proposal is to identify a set of robust and clinically significant genetic variants that can predict therapeutic response to asthma drugs. Our goal is to replace the current \"trial-and-error\" paradigm of asthma treatment with an inexpensive, rapid, and reliable pharmacogenetic test of non-response, to inhaled steroids or [unreadable]2-agonists. As such, we have structured pur Specific Aims as follows: 1. We will choose candidate genes in the [unreadable]2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid pathways, identify genetic variants in these genes, genotype individuals in clinical drug trials at these loci, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. The genes with positive association results that are replicated in multiple study populations will be comprehensively resequenced for functional assessment. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative level to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. 3. We will develop and validate a predictive test of asthma therapeutic response to [unreadable]2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid drugs. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. DNA samples and matching phenotypic data have been collected from 3698 asthmatics enrolled in 12 well-designed asthma drug trials. This allows us to replicate association findings and validate our pharmacogenetic test in multiple populations. If successful, our research should directly benefit patient care by lowering morbidity and mortality and substantially decreasing health care costs.      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormalities of cardiac rhythm are a major public health problem. Drugs suppress cardiac arrhythmias in some patients, yet exacerbate arrhythmias or even generate new ones - the phenomenon of proarrhythmia - in others. This variability is not confined to antiarrhythmic drugs alone: in fact, the risk of proarrhythmia related to excessive prolongation of the QT interval has been the single leading cause of drug withdrawal over the past decade. While rare monogenic arrhythmia syndromes have been recognized for decades, more recent work strongly supports the overall hypothesis tested here, that common DMA variants underlie not only variability in cardiac rhythm but also the response of normal and abnormal cardiac rhythms to drug exposure. In Specific Aim 1, we will identify coding and non-coding variants and haplotypes in genes that are candidate modulators of cardiac rhythm, and functionally characterize these in vitro; these studies will inform the refinement of our current multiplexed arrhythmia genotyping platforms. In Specific Aim 2, we propose a series of studies to define genomic contributors to variable QT responses to drug therapy. In Specific Aim 3, variability in drug response in atrial fibrillation, the commonest arrhythmia for which drug therapy is currently prescribed, will be evaluated; here, we include a focus on \"non-traditional\" signaling pathways, such as the renin-angiotensin system and inflammation, that contemporary electrophysiology increasingly implicates in this arrhythmia. The Specific Aims will be supported by scientific Core resources devoted to ascertainment, DMA banking, database management, epidemiology and statistics, polymorphism discovery, genotyping, and functional studies.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although once protected from cardiovascular disease (CVD), American Indians now have incidence rates higher than the general US population.  The majority of CVD cases occur in individuals with diabetes.  It is therefore imperative that intervention strategies to reduce CVD in diabetic individuals be developed and validated in this population.  This proposal is for a randomized 3-year trial to examine the effects on CVD of intensive LDL reduction (goal less than or equal to 75 mg/dL) and intensive blood pressure lowering (goal less than or equal to 115/75 mmHg), compared to usual targets of less than or equal to 100 mg/dL and less than or equal to 130/85 mmHg.  These cutpoints were chosen because mean LDL and blood pressure levels are lower in this population, but there is a strong relation between LDL, blood pressure, and CVD at levels below current targets.  The primary endpoint will be carotid intimal-medial thickness.  Secondary endpoints will include cardiac function measures by echocardiography, lipoproteins, albuminuria, and C-reactive protein (CRP).  The study will enroll 488 diabetic American Indian men and women more than 40 years of age and will be conducted in four field centers involving Indian Health/Tribal primary care facilities in Phoenix/Sacaton, Arizona; Chinle, Arizona; Rapid City/Pine Ridge, South Dakota; and Lawton, Oklahoma, with input from American Indian physicians and community members.  Study results will provide evidence needed to develop community-based programs to treat and prevent the epidemic of CVD among American Indians.  The data will also be valuable in understanding the effects of intensive risk-factor reduction on atherosclerosis burden and cardiac function in diabetic individuals in all US populations and provide evidence for determining LDL and blood pressure treatment goals for diabetic patients.',\n",

Our three Institutions have collaborated since 1996 in over 48 projects with funding of approximately 56 million dollars. Over 90% of the over 300 patients with congenital heart defects who undergo open heart surgery at our Centers are followed in our clinics annually. Our patient population is unique: our patients are ethnically and racially diverse, poor, and rural. The challenges and unique strengths encountered by our patients are likely to affect outcomes measured in clinical trials. These effects must be identified to generalize the results of PHN clinical trials to encompass the patient population across the United States. We propose a randomized, multi-Institutional, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of spironolactone on exercise performance in children who have undergone Fontan surgery: aldosterone blockade and exercise (ABLE). Hypothesis: Spironolactone will improve the exercise performance and quality of life of Fontan patients, 6-21 years of age. Primary objective: Determine the effect of spironolactone on peak oxygen consumption. Secondary Objectives: determine efficacy of spironolactone as measured by 1) quality of life, assessed by validated measures; 2) ventricular filling parameters, assessed by tissue Doppler echocardiography; 3) amount of myocardial scarring assessed by MRI; 4) neurohormonal activation, BNP; biomarkers of collagen synthesis, procollagen I and III peptides; and 5) renin angiotensin  aldosterone system polymorphisms. The trial duration is six months. A sample size of 220 per treatment group will be required to achieve 85% statistical power to detect mean differences in peak oxygen consumption between spironolactone and placebo, using a two-sided test without alpha = 0.05, if the expected mean difference in peak oxygen consumption between groups is 2 ml/kg/min and the standard deviation within the group is 7 ml/kg/min.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Over the past decade the survival of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) has improved significantly, leading to an increasing number of survivors. Recognized sequelae of surgery for congenital heart surgery include residual hemodynamic abnormalities and arrhythmias. It is now being recognized that the neurodevelopmental sequelae of this type of surgery are substantial. Specifically, many school age children are challenged because of problems with inattention and hyperactivity; that is, they appear to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There is evidence that ADHD is more prevalent in the post surgery CHD patients than in the general population. In addition, the CHD-ADHD patients seem to be under treated. Thus, the primary aims of this study include 1) to determine the prevalence of ADHD in the population of children with CHD undergoing surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass in infancy or early childhood; 2) to compare the prevalence rates of ADHD associated with age of exposure to cardiopulmonary bypass as well as the effect of multiple exposures to CPB and different adjunctive support techniques that may be utilized; 3) to identify and compare the variety of patient related, operative and postoperative risk factors that could affect the likelihood of developing ADHD, including type of congenital heart defect, genetic substrate, surgical procedure required, operative factors, and perioperative events; and 4) to test the safety and efficacy of stimulant medications used to treat ADHD in a postoperative cardiac population. While studies suggest that many of these children have ADHD and could potentially benefit from the standard stimulant drug therapy effective in most of the population, concerns over cardiac safety has severely limited its use in children with heart disease. As no safety studies of the stimulant drugs in this population have been attempted, we propose a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial of the two most commonly used stimulant medications to determine their efficacy and true level of risk in postoperative cardiac children. This information will allow clinicians to use these potentially effective drugs safely in appropriate cardiac patients, improving the quality of life for these children with special needs. The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Cardiology Division and Cardiac Center have a distinguished history of clinical innovation and excellence in cardiac care, a high volume program with expertise is all areas of pediatric cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery. The faculty of the CHOP and Cardiac Center are experienced investigators in multicenter clinical trials and studies.

This consortium has all the critical elements for a center in the PHN: adequate patient volume, clinical research infrastructure, a track record of subject enrollment, and a dedication to hypothesis driven clinical research.  [unreadable] Indeed, these elements have allowed MUSC to be a highly successful participant in the PHN. Further, MUSC faculty have participated as Pi's in a large number and wide variety of multicenter trials or registries, and the Pi's of this proposal have often been the lead investigator. MUSC faculty also currently run numerous local clinical research protocols. Participation in all of these protocols is supported by a dedicated pediatric cardiac research support group with RN coordinators and an administrative FTE. The combined resources of patient volume and strong research infrastructure have enabled MUSC to be among the top subject enrollers as well. Protocol: Randomized Trial of Preoperative Corticosteroid Therapy in Neonates Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB). CPB is critical to corrective intracardiac surgery, but the pathophysiologic processes engendered by CPB, particularly in neonates, play an important role in post- CPB recovery. The use, doses and schedule of glucortocoid administration to ameliorate these CPB induced processes appears to be highly variable among pediatric cardiac surgical centers, without clear data to provide direction. The Primary Aim of this study is to compare the effects of preoperative intravenous methypredisolone (IVMP) to placebo on the Primary Endpoint of low cardiac output state (LCOS) or death at 36 hours following neonatal CPB. We hypothesize that neonates receiving preoperative IVMP will have a decreased incidence of the Primary Endpoint. Secondary Endpoints include: inotropic score at 36 hours, fluid balance, ICU stay parameters, echocardiographic measures, levels of inflammatory molecules, and safety parameters. One unique aspect of the protocol is the use of a novel multiplexer technology which allows analysis of a broad array of cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases and myeloperoxidase from a sample of one milliliter or less of whole blood. The results of this study should clearly define the clinical utility of preoperative steroids and help determine the mechanisms for any observed effect. (End of Abstract).

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Sick euthyroid syndrome is common among infants and children following cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. Recent data suggest that triiodothyronine (T3) supplementation after cardiac surgery may improve postoperative outcomes. We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the effect of T3 supplementation on the postoperative course and later neurodevelopmental outcome in neonates undergoing the Norwood procedure. T3 will be administered for 72 hours after cessation of bypass. Children in both treatment groups will receive conventional therapy. Based upon the literature and our own pilot study, we anticipate that T3 will have few adverse effects. Our first aim is to test the hypothesis that T3 supplementation, compared to placebo, will be associated with better early postoperative hemodynamic status and faster postoperative recovery. Our primary outcome measure will be a composite clinical outcome score, with values from 0-7, based upon the time until negative fluid balance is first achieved; time until sternal closure; time until first extubation; and the occurrence of death or use of ECMO. Secondary outcomes will include individual components of the clinical outcome score, as well as inotrope requirement over the initial 5 postoperative days, myocardial performance index, serum lactate accumulation following the termination of bypass; length of postoperative stay in the ICU and hospital; and incidence of serious adverse events. Our second aim is to test the hypothesis that T3 supplementation, compared to placebo, will be associated with superior developmental outcome. Our primary outcome variable will be score on the Psychodevelopment Index (PDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at age one year. Secondary outcomes will include the Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales, the MacArthur Communicative Developmental Index, and the Functional Status Il-Revised questionnaire. The structure of the study will allow us to explore the relationship of postoperative T3 levels to preoperative, intraoperative and early postoperative management strategies, including use of modifiers of thyroid function such as topical iodine, iodinated contrast, and dopamine. The trial will span three years from onset of enrollment until completion of follow-up. If T3 therapy is found to be advantageous to the Norwood population, it may benefit many other children with congenital heart disease who require surgery in early infancy. The information learned about the interrelationships of thyroid hormone status and other medical and surgical therapies in infants undergoing the Norwood procedure makes an important contribution to the overall management of these particularly complex and high-risk patients. This study takes advantage of the expertise and momentum accumulated in enrolling and managing infants undergoing the Norwood procedure in research protocols within the Pediatric Heart Network.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] The use of cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery in children results in important morbidity and sometimes mortality related to the adverse effects of bypass induced by hypothermia, hemolysis, acid-base management, hemodilution and hypoxia-ischemia. After bypass, reperfusion occurs and induces ischemia reperfusion injury. Inflammation and oxidative stress are key mediators in this process. The objective of this study is to determine if application of a stimulus of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) prevents or lessens the multi-organ dysfunction related to ischemia-reperfusion injury in children undergoing open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. We will also seek to determine mechanistic gene expression profiles associated with this treatment effect, and baseline profiles that are predictive of clinical outcomes after surgery. We propose a randomized, double-blind sham-controlled clinical trial. At the time preparation for surgery, 4 cycles of 5 minutes each of lower limb ischemia will be induced by inflation of a blood pressure cuff. Gene expression profiling will be noted at induction of anesthesia before application of the RIPC stimulus, 15 minutes after RIPC and at 24 after cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary outcome will be total duration of post-operative hospital stay, and 1200 patients will be studied, with a hypothesized decrease of 1 day associated with RIPC. Additional outcomes will reflect multi-organ dysfunction and inflammation and their impact, and include duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of stay in the intensive care unit, and physiologic measures over the first 48 hours after surgery. These measures will include indices of renal (urine output, urea, creatinine), cardiac (troponin I, inotrope score), pulmonary (pulmonary and airway mechanics, ventilation parameters), hematologic (blood counts), hepatic (transaminases, INR), metabolic (lactate, arterial and mixed venous oxygen saturations) dysfunction and inflammatory markers (cytokines, CRP). The impact of RIPC on these outcomes will be compared, and related to gene expression patterns, particularly those involved in the inflammatory cascade. Our study will have an important impact on improving the recovery and reducing complications for children undergoing open heart surgery. It will also define important ways in which the body can be further protected from the stresses of undergoing surgery using heart-lung bypass.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Palliative surgery in neonates with a single right ventricle (RV), the Norwood 1 procedure, carries the highest risk for mortality and morbidity of all cardiac surgical procedures performed in infancy. The Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) Trial is an ongoing Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) study designed to compare one year outcomes between two surgical modifications of the Norwood 1 procedure. The two modifications differ in their potential effect on RV myocardium: the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) results in a diastolic run-off of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary arteries that may compromise coronary blood flow, while the RV-to-pulmonary artery (RV-to-PA) shunt avoids this potential coronary artery steal phenomenon, but has a long term risk of right ventricular damage from a right ventriculotomy. The primary hypothesis of the SVR Trial is that the RV-to-PA shunt will have a lower incidence of death or transplant at one year of age. There is an ongoing risk of death or transplant extending beyond one year in this patient population, especially as planned open heart surgery is performed between 18 months and 3 years of age. This multicenter prospective follow-up study is designed to extend comparison of clinical outcome and RV performance between survivors of the RV-to-PA shunt and MBTS up to age 4 years. The primary aim is to compare the intermediate-term combined endpoint of death or transplant between the two groups with the hypothesis that the RV-to-PA shunt will have a lower incidence of death or transplantation compared the MBTS at 4 years of age. Secondary aims will include comparison of neurodelopmental outcome, health-related quality of life, RV function, somatic growth, pulmonary artery growth, the incidence heart failure, arrhythmias and the operative and post-operative course following Fontan completion. All subjects enrolled in the SVR Trial who survive to completion at 14 months of age will be eligible for inclusion. Data will be collected at the time of enrollment, at the time of the Fontan surgery (expected to occur between 18 months-3 years of age) and at age 4 years. An application to support a Clinical Research Skills Development Core is also included in this proposal. Relevance to public health: Surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome has the highest incidence of death or transplantation of all congenital heart disease lesions. The results of this multicenter, prospective study will provide important information regarding the optimal neonatal surgical intervention for this lesion.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Increasing numbers of infants are undergoing complete repair rather than palliation of congenital heart defects that requires placement of a cryopreserved valved allograft in the pulmonary position. Allograft implantation results in the production of HLA antibodies that contribute to the development of conduit stenosis and regurgitation and ultimately the need for replacement. In fact, 60 -100% of infant implants fail within 5 years, offsetting the success of an early complete repair since subsequent surgeries are needed. In addition, some of these children develop end-stage heart disease and may be listed for heart transplantation, If panel reactive antibodies (PRA) are >10%, prospective cross matching is required, limiting the donor pool and increasing both morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, despite successful prospective cross-matching, the incidence of graft rejection is higher in sensitized children than in children who do not have HLA antibodies. Thus, abrogating antibody production and prolonging the durability of the allograft would reduce the number of conduit replacement surgeries along with the associated surgical morbidity and mortality, economic burden, family stress, and negative effect of multiple hospitalizations on growth and development.  It would also decrease the transplantation risk in the subset of children who develop end-stage heart disease. Pharmacological abrogation of the antibody response with a brief course of immunosuppression using mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) appeared successful and safe in a pilot study involving a small number of children who received a first time cryopreserved valved allograft. Before widespread use can be recommended, however, a randomized trial with adequate power is needed. The overall goal of this prospective randomized trial is to evaluate the proportion of subjects with PRA <10% in a group receiving MMF compared with a group receiving standard therapy only. In addition, echocardiographic endpoints of allograft failure will be evaluated along with their association with PRA. Drug safety will be determined by monitoring adverse events and specific blood tests. This study is being proposed to the Pediatric Heart Network because it requires several centers to provide an adequate number of subjects and because the required tests and procedures are widely used in clinical practice so each center will have the needed equipment and personnel to implement the protocol and obtain the studies and samples required for evaluation by core laboratories. Lay summary: Infants with heart defects who need a conduit placed between their right-sided heart pump and the blood vessel that goes to the lungs have early failure of that conduit and need additional surgeries to replace it each time it fails. This research will determine if a drug (mycophenolate mofetil) given for a short time after the conduit is first put in will safely decrease the body's reaction to the conduit and make it last longer so the child will not need as many operations.

       " 'Overweight/obesity is the second leading cause of death in the US, and is growing in prevalence at an alarming rate. Control of overweight/obesity is increasingly recognized as a high national priority because of its contribution to cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors and ultimately to CVD itself. The short-term success of behavioral interventions for weight loss has been repeatedly documented. Unfortunately, because weight re-gain is extremely common, a disappointingly small proportion of individuals achieve long-term weight control. Of the factors that are associated with sustained weight loss, one of the most important is continued intervention with frequent contacts. We propose a multi- center, randomized, controlled trial [Weight Loss Maintenance Trial (MAINTENANCE)] to determine the effects of two innovative behavioral interventions, each designed to maintain frequent contacts, compared to a usual care control group. Overweight and obese individuals (-60% women, -40% African Americans) who are taking medication for hypertension, dyslipidemia and/or type 2 diabetes will enter a 6 month weight loss program. Those individuals who lose at least 4 kg (N = 800) will then be randomized into one of three groups: a Personal Contact (PC) Intervention that provides monthly personal contacts with a trained interventionist, primarily via telephone; an Interactive Technology (IT) Intervention that provides frequent contacts through a state-of-the-art interactive web-based program supplemented by other communication technologies; or Usual Care (UC). The primary outcome will be weight change from the end of the initial weight loss program to the end of the 30-month weight maintenance intervention period. Other outcomes will include weight change in subgroups, prevalence of CVD risk factors, measures of behavior change, and cost of implementation. For each outcome, the PC and IT interventions will be compared to UC, and if different from UC, to each other. To successfully combat the obesity epidemic, clinicians and health care systems must have options that are effective and feasible, and that can be provided to large numbers of individuals. The purpose of this proposal is to develop and test two such interventions, which, if effective, should complement ongoing efforts to stem the obesity epidemic and ultimately prevent obesity-related CVD.',\n",

These patients first will be characterized by angina intensity or presence of left main coronary stenosis as appropriate for only surgical therapy or either medical or surgical therapy. All patients will be evaluated further for appropriateness of SVR indicated by an end-systolic volume index (ESVI) >60 ml/m2 and akinesia >35% of the anterior LV wall. The 600 patients estimated to be eligible for SVR but ineligible for randomization to medical therapy will be evenly randomized to CABG with or without SVR.

Continuing progress from the previous funding period, the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) proposes to develop and execute scientifically meritorious, prospective clinical trials addressing key issues in HCT. We will conduct multicenter Phase II and more importantly, prospective Phase III trials in six key areas including: alternative donors and graft sources; regimen related toxicity; GVHD; disease recurrence; infection and immune reconstitution; and late effects and quality of life. Due to the complexity of pediatric transplantation, especially in those with rare inherited disorders, which are complex and difficult to study, we will devote special attention and focused scientific expertise to using the coordinated strength of the Network to improve BMT outcomes for this unique population. The BMT CTN  [unreadable] will also amplify and leverage Network resources through collaborative research and ancillary studies of biologic endpoints that will be integrated with and complement clinical endpoints.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] The first successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HCT) were done in 1968 in three children with congenital immune deficiency diseases. In each instance, stem cells were collected from the bone marrow of sibling donors who were genotypically identical or closely matched to the recipient for human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Since then, thousands of HCTs have been performed to treat malignant and non-malignant diseases. Current estimates of annual numbers of HCTs are about 45,000 worldwide, with 15-20,000 annually in the United State. Reasons for increasing use include proven and potential efficacy in many diseases, better understanding of the appropriate timing of transplantation and patient selection, greater availability of donors and better techniques for determining HLA match, greater ease of stem cell collection, and improved supportive care resulting in less transplant-related mortality. Despite these improvements,  [unreadable] application of HCT is still limited by relatively high risks of morbidity and mortality and, in the case of allogeneic HCT, availability of suitable donors. HCT outcomes are influenced by many patient- and disease-related factors such as age, disease stage and prior treatment, as well as transplant-related factors such as stem cell source and transplant regimen. Ideally, the effectiveness of most transplant strategies would be evaluated in large randomized clinical trials. However, various factors hamper the ability to conduct randomized trials in this setting. Many diseases treated with HCT are uncommon. Additionally, for allogeneic transplants, not all patients have a suitable  [unreadable] donor identified. Consequently, even when one considers the most common indications for HCT, numbers of eligible patients in individual centers are small. The ability to test new transplant strategies in a definitive way requires the existence of a network committed to development and implementation of large, multicenter studies. Under RFA HL-01-004, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) jointly established a Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN). The goal of the Network is to efficiently assess novel HCT methods and management strategies derived from single center studies in a multi-center setting. The focus of this group, in contrast to cancer clinical trials groups, is on improving the transplant procedure per se rather than cancer treatment in general.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this grant is to both define and confirm the genetic contribution to the large inter-individual variability in clinical response to treatment with statin drugs. The multidisciplinary research team has expertise in genomics, statistical genetics and informatics, clinical pharmacology and cardiology, laboratory measurements of cardiovascular risk factors, and epidemiology. In a sequential design, using samples from a total of 10,000 subjects treated with various statins, we will use a genome wide association approach to identify SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that are associated with laboratory measurements of statin response, including LDL and HDL subfractions, markers of cholesterol absorption and synthesis, and the inflammatory marker hs-CRP. Initial analyses in 1,000 Caucasian subjects from trials of simvastatin or pravastatin will be based on a panel of 250,000 genome-wide SNPs (Aim 1). Confirmatory analyses in cohorts treated with rosuvastatin (Aim 2) and atorvastatin (Aim 3) will yield a panel of 1,100 SNPs most consistently associated with variation in statin response of LDL cholesterol and other phenotypes in Caucasians and African-Americans. In addition, the genome-wide SNP panel along with candidate gene SNPs will be used to identify those associated with statin-related myopathy in 150 cases vs. 300 matched controls. Genomic resequencing of the 50 genes most strongly associated in Aims 2 and 3 with statininduced reductions in LDL cholesterol and other informative phenotypes will identify allelic variants in a total of 48 Caucasians and 48 African-American randomly selected from the highest and lowest 5% of the distributions of these phenotypes in the respective ethnic groups (Aim 4). Finally, these SNPs will be tested for associations with both laboratory phenotypes and clinical cardiovascular outcomes (Aim 5). This program presents a comprehensive approach for determining effects of specific genotypes on clinically meaningful variations in responsiveness to a class of drugs widely used to prevent cardiovascular disease.

       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Health-relatedness and Long-term Objectives: Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a common problem for which there is no clear consensus on diagnosis or therapy. There likely exists a progression wherein renal ischemia leads to neuroendocdne activation, hypertension, and renal insufficiency potentially resulting in acceleration of therosclerosis, further renal dysfunction, myocardial infarction, stroke and death. The current proposal tests whether revascularization of a stenotic renal artery plus optimum medical therapy is associated with improved clinical outcomes when compared with optimum medical therapy alone.   Specific Aims, Design and Methods: Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) is a randomized clinical trial that will contrast the effect of optimum medical therapy alone to stenting with optimum medical therapy, on a composite cardiovascular and renal endpoint: cardiovascular or renal death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, stroke, doubling of serum creatinine level, and need for renal replacement therapy. This endpoint will be adjudicated by a clinical events committee masked to treatment assignment. The secondary endpoints 1) evaluate the mechanisms linked to clinical events; 2) describe differential effectiveness in critical end-organs; 3) determine the value of stenting from the patient and the health policy perspectives, measured as quality of life and cost effectiveness; and 4) evaluate for clinically relevant differences in treatment effectiveness within the primary endpoint. The primary entry criteria are an atherosclerotic renal stenosis >60% with a 20 mmHg systolic pressure gradient and systolic hypertension >155 mmHg on 2 or more anti-hypertensive medications. A slight predominance of women is expected, and high priority will be placed on minority recruitment. Approximately 2200 patients will undergo a baseline evaluation with randomization occurring in 1080. The study has 90% power to detect a 28% reduction in primary endpoint hazard rate. This R01 from the Clinical Coordinating Center describes the main study hypotheses and overall trial conduct.        ',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   FREEDOM is a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) with percutaneous coronary stenting using the Sirolimus-eluting stent in diabetic patients with multivessel disease.  The main objective of the study is to compare a multivessel stenting strategy using Sirolimus-eluting stents with CABG with respect to mortality in 5 years of follow-up.   The study population will consist of 2300 patients (1150/arm) with diabetes mellitus diagnosed according to the American Diabetes Association, and multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) (2 or more stenotic lesions in at least 2 major epicardial coronary arteries), amenable to either PCI with stenting or surgical revascularization.  All subjects will be screened to ensure that all inclusion and exclusion criteria are fulfilled prior to study entry.  A written informed consent will be obtained prior to enrollment in the study.  Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized on a 1:1 basis either to CABG or multivessel stenting using Sirolimus-eluting stents.      The primary outcome of the study is the difference in mortality rates between the stent group and the CABG group over the 5-year period.  The following secondary endpoints will be assessed:  1) survival functions over years 1, 2, 3 and 4; 2) individual components of MACCE in-hospital at 30 days, 6 months and 12 months; 3) quality of life pre- and post-randomization every 6 months up to 5 years; 4) neuro-cognitive function pre-procedure and 6 months, 1 year and 5 years post-procedure; and 5) cost-effectiveness analyses, hospital length of stay, resource utilization, repeat hospitalization, and repeat revascularization events.      We plan to recruit all patients over the course of 18 months at 100 clinical sites.',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The continuing evolution in medical care, adoption of high technology therapies, and advances in blood banking technology have led to innovations in transfusion therapy. Wise decisions about the use of novel blood products and the management of hemostatic disorders has created a need for a national clinical trials network to evaluate new therapies. A Transfusion Medicine and Hemostasis (TMH) Clinical Trials Network (CTN) was established in 2002. The principal investigators and their collaborators at the 17 funded sites, have worked successfully to develop and implement clinical trials in transfusion medicine and hemostasis. Protocols presently active include platelet dose (PLADO), use of fresh frozen plasma (SHIP), and those soon to be initiated are: granulocyte transfusion, an observational study of thrombosis in heparin induced thrombocytopenia, and rituximab for inhibitors in hemophilia. Several others are less developed. The University of Minnesota has a long history of successful transfusion medicine and hemostasis clinical trials. There is an excellent productive relationship between key clinical services and hemostasis and transfusion medicine faculty. The resources to successfully produce novel blood products or to provide new therapies for hemostatic conditions are available through our Molecular and Cellular Facility and Cell Therapy Laboratory the hospital blood bank and through excellent relationships with traditional blood suppliers. Therefore we propose to continue to participate in the Transfusion Medicine and Hemostasis Clinical Trials Network to continue to address important clinical issues that need scientific study in a multi-center network. Over the next the 5 years, as part of the TMH CTN we propose to participate in the network to: Maintain, and further enhance, a structure to support the development, implementation and conduct of clinical trials in the areas of transfusion medicine and hemostasis. Utilize the structure of working and study oversight subcommittees to complete ongoing trials and develop, refine and complete new trials proposed in this application. Develop collaborative relationships and support training opportunities to facilitate the success of the proposed clinical trials and further the fields of transfusion medicine and hemostasis. Disseminate results of the TMH CTN through presentation and publication of clinical trial results and other TMH CTN activities.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The overall goal of the Transfusion Medicine/Hemostasis Clinical Trials Network (TMH CTN) is to conduct multi-center clinical studies to evaluate treatments and management strategies for children and adults with hemostatic disorders and methods of transfusion support for a variety of patient populations. The New England Research Institutes, Inc. (NERI) will continue to support the TMH CTN as Data Coordinating Center (DCC). The DCC has the following aims: 1) to collaborate in the selection, design, conduct, analysis and reporting of clinical studies and trials; 2) to develop a mechanism for patient recruitment and retention from out-of-network centers; 3) to manage protocol fund disbursement to both core and non-core sites; 4) to develop and maintain a data management system for each network study; 5) to institute quality control procedures including training site study personnel and conducting site visits; 6) to identify central laboratories and central review panels, and develop a system for tracking lab specimens and results; 7) to compile, edit, analyze and report study data; and 8) to coordinate the activities and meetings of the Steering Committee, and provide materials for PRC and DSMB members. During its first four years, the network has begun 3 clinical trials, and has 4 other studies nearing the final stages of development. These ongoing and planned studies include adjudication of specific clinical eligibility criteria and endpoints, a central ultrasound reading facility, and several central laboratories. The Transfusion Medicine/Hemostasis Clinical Trials Network will have an impact on the standard of care by investigating the efficacy, safety, and healthcare policy implications of treatment strategies in transfusion medicine and hematology. Conducting multicenter clinical trials within this network will provide sufficient subjects to evaluate important hypotheses regarding therapy and management in the respective patient populations. Study findings will be disseminated to the medical and scientific communities. The Transfusion Medicine/Hemostasis Clinical Trials Network plans and carries out studies in two areas of medicine. Transfusion Medicine studies investigate which patients need to be treated by giving transfusions, and which types and doses of transfusions to give. Hemostasis studies investigate disorders that put people at increased risk for serious bleeding or blood clots, and how to treat these disorders.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  [unreadable]   [unreadable] This is a five year renewal application for the Transfusion Medicine/Hemostasis Clinical Research Network (TMHCRN). The mission of the TMH is to launch key clinical trials in the related fields of transfusion medicine, and in treatment of bleeding and bleeding disorders. The range of potential disorders spanned by the TMHCRN is wide, and reflected by the structure of the network into committees devoted to domains within these broad fields. The network is composed of 17 US core sites, a data coordinating center, and a number of consortium and project-specific collaboration partners. The multicenter nature of the network is critical for sample size considerations in studies of rare blood disorders. This application represents a consortium of three Harvard teaching hospitals, with demonstrated capability for network participation and active accrual to the current network studies. To date, the network has launched three active clinical studies, one on optimal platelet transfusion dose in thrombocytopenia, one on treatment of long INR to prevent surgical bleeding, and one on treatment of congenital hemophilia with inhibitors with the targeted anti-B cell agent, rituximab. This renewal application details several studies in the pipeline already, which will be launched during the upcoming five year period. In addition, specific new protocols are proposed, the result of network-wide \"think tank\" activities during 2006. The plan is to further develop and launch these studies in turn through the steering committee development and approval process, and through the pipeline in turn. (I) a phase III study of fondaparinux versus argatroban in the treatment of isolated heparin induced thrombocytopenia; (II) A randomized trial of epsilon- aminocaproic acid and platelet transfusions vs platelet transfusion alone in the prevention of bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients, and (III) a randomized trial of an oral thrombopoietin-mimetic agent plus standard care, versus standard care, in children with persistent immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The network serves as a fertile ground for collaborative research, and a particularly important resource for training young physician scientists in patient-oriented research in transfusion medicine and non-malignant hematology, in accordance with recent initiatives of NIH overall, and of NHLBI.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Pediatric asthma, the most common chronic illness of childhood, is increasing in prevalence, morbidity and mortality : particularly in minority children.  This application seeks to establish the Rhode Island : Puerto Rico Asthma Center (RIPRAC) for reducing disparities in asthma among Latino children.  Brown University faculty involved with an extensive pediatric asthma research program will join with epidemiologists, clinicians, and health services researchers from the minority serving University of Puerto Rico to study potentially overlooked determinants of disparity.  An ambitious training component (based on a successful T32 research training program) will involve individuals from both sites at both sites.  The RIPRAC Research AIMS include four projects that seek to understand the causes of disparities at multiple levels : the biomedical, the individual/family, and the socioenvironmental level.  The four projects, respectively, will 1) examine discrepancies between the diagnosis of asthma as assessed by parental report, the primary care medical record and our systematic diagnosis base on the NHLBI guidelines; 2) assess characteristics (prescription practices, shared decision making, continuity and access to care) of the health care system that may differentially affect asthma morbidity; 3) evaluate family beliefs, the burden of asthma management and medication adherence as they affect asthma morbidity and health care utilization in Latino and Anglo children; and 4) study the relation of symptom perception to pediatric asthma discrepancies.  Subjects for all 4 projects will be the same 300 mainland Anglos, 200 mainland Latinos (of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent) and 400 island Puerto Rico children with asthma, aged 7-15, thereby promoting comparability and efficiency.  Chi-square analyses and ANOVA's will be used to assess differences between groups; techniques of logistic regression and multiple regression will be used to model the effects of covariates.  The RIPRAC Training component will provide clinical research education and supervision to Puerto Rican trainees and faculty, enhance cultural awareness of Brown personnel as it relates to asthma disparities, and launch at least three trainee-led pilot research projects in the area.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Over the past decade there has been a heightened awareness of the disproportionate impact of asthma morbidity and mortality among African Americans and persons of lower social economic status. The causes underlying this disparity have not been fully elucidated. However, there is strong evidence that the level of social stress imposed by this condition and the degree of coping and self-management skills present are factors that may be particularly important in explaining these disparities. The purpose of this project is to develop a collaborative research program between Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Cook County Hospital to fully characterize the relationship of social stress, coping, and self-regulatory health behaviors in the context of asthma disparities among African American and low income populations. Once characterized, the project will then develop and test an intervention strategy to reduce asthma disparities in high-risk populations based on evidence-based models that have demonstrated success in social work, nursing, and community interventions. There are four research aims for this proposed Center of Excellence.      (1) To develop and validate culturally appropriate psychosocial instruments related to the underlying causes of disparity in asthma morbidity (2) To identify the structural relationships of psychosocial factors to other known influential factors related to disparities in asthma outcomes. (3) To study the changes in structural relationship among influential factors in asthma disparity over time as related to changes in health status. (4) To develop, pilot test, and field test a community-based asthma team (peer coach, asthma nurse, and social worker) intervention to enhance individuals ability to cope with chronic illness and improve asthma-related behaviors. A second major goal of this Center will be to train and mentor new clinical investigators and social scientists to be able to conduct research in this field of interest.',\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The overall objective of this response to the limited competition RFA (HL-06-123) is to localize and identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and genetic variants that determine individuals' blood pressure (BP) responses to dietary salt and potassium intervention by using the extensive phenotype and genotype data as well as biological specimens already collected in the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt-Sensitivity (GenSalt). The specific aims are to examine the effect of environmental risk factors and physiological/ biochemical measures on BP responses to dietary sodium and potassium intervention; to conduct genome-wide linkage analyses on BP responses to dietary sodium and potassium intervention as well as cold pressor test using 407 microsatellite markers genotyped in GenSalt; to conduct genetic association analyses of BP responses to dietary sodium and potassium intervention as well as cold pressor test using 278 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously genotyped in 30 biological candidate genes; and to fine-map positional candidate genes under one most promising linkage peak with dense SNP mapping. GenSalt is a unique NHLBI-sponsored family feeding-study conducted in 3,153 participants from 658 families living in rural areas of northern China. Each GenSalt family was ascertained through a proband with untreated pre-hypertension or stage-1 hypertension identified from population BP screening. The dietary intervention, which included a 7-day low sodium-feeding (51.3 mmol/day), a 7-day high sodium-feeding (307.8 mmol/day), and a 7-day high sodium-feeding with an oral potassium supplementation (60 mmol/day), was conducted among 1,906 probands, sibs, spouses, and offspring within a continuous 3-week period. Three BP measurements were obtained on each of 3 days during the baseline and on the last 3 days of each of the 3 intervention periods. The proposed study has important public health and clinical implications. Establishing a relationship between genetic variants with salt-sensitivity and potassium-sensitivity will help identify individuals at high risk for hypertension and who should receive a low sodium and high potassium dietary intervention. In addition, identifying genes related to salt-sensitivity and potassium-sensitivity of BP should enable the discovery of new pharmaceutical treatment for hypertension.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The Amish Heredity and Phenotype Intervention (HAPI) Heart Study is one of four studies that constitute the NHLBI PROGENI Network. The overall goal of this project is to identify genes that interact with specific environmental exposures to influence risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In 900 Amish subjects, we obtained baseline CVD phenotypes and response phenotypes to four short-term interventions, including blood pressure (BP) response to cold pressor stress, BP response to high and low salt diets, triglyceride response to a high fat feeding, and platelet response to aspirin therapy. Genotyping of over 250,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)(Affymetrix Nsp chip) and SNPs in candidate genes for response phenotypes in these subjects are underway and will be completed by September 2006. In this Limited Competition Renewal application, we propose to continue and extend our analyses of this unique dataset. First, we will characterize the genetic epidemiology of the CVD response phenotypes to the four short-term interventions. Second, we will carry out a genome-wide linkage scan of response phenotypes to the four interventions using a subset of SNPs genotyped from the 250K SNP chip in 900 Amish HAPI Heart Study participants. We will then compare regions of linkage with those identified from analysis of the same phenotypes in other PROGENI studies. Finally, we will conduct genetic association analyses of response phenotypes to evaluate whether (a) SNPs that fall within regions under the linkage peaks identified are associated with variation in response phenotypes; (b) single SNPs and/or haplotypes genotyped in a small set of carefully targeted candidate genes are associated with variation in response phenotypes; (c) SNPs and/or haplotypes found to be associated with response phenotypes in other PROGENI studies are also associated with the same phenotype in the Amish HAPI Heart Study; and (d) response phenotype associated SNPs identified in (a) and (b) above are also associated with variation in subclinical atherosclerosis as measured by carotid intimal media thickness (IMT). These discoveries may lead to new insights into the pathophysiology of CVD, more effective strategies for risk stratification and prevention, and novel targets for therapeutic interventions, thus decreasing morbidity and mortality in millions of middle age and elderly Americans.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The Programs in Gene-Environment Interaction (PROGENI) represents a network of family studies designed to discover novel interactions between genes and environment. The goal at Johns Hopkins has been to discover genes that modify the response of platelets to low dose aspirin (ASA). The study, known as GeneSTAR (Genetic Study of Aspirin Responsiveness), is being conducted in over 3000 people characterized for platelet function at baseline and after low dose ASA. The study population represents 609 2-generational families with premature coronary disease. We are analyzing results from the first 1600 participants of i) a 550-short tandem repeat (STR) marker genome scan and 2) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of 3000 SNPs in 191 candidate genes selected for their role in platelet function, cell signaling, inflammation, and vascular structure and function. Preliminary analyses have identified some genetic loci and candidate genes with significant linkage and/or association with platelet phenotypes. In this continuation of our work, our fist aim is to perform linkage analysis of STR markers to identify genomic loci that are linked to important platelet phenotypes followed by fine mapping using additional STR markers to achieve a density of 1cM and/or 2) appropriate SNP clusters. We will prioritize the loci for fine mapping on the basis of the presence of both a significant linkage peak and a significant association of a candidate gene in the linkage region with a phenotype of interest. Secondly, we will perform family based association analysis to determine whether candidate genes are associated with important platelet phenotypes. The genotyping results from the second half of the study sample will be used as a replication sample for the results from the first 1600 participants. Analyses will also be performed to discover haplotypes of candidate genes associated with baseline and post-ASA phenotypes. We plan a further replication of our results for collagen-induced platelet aggregation in whole blood in the HAPI Heart Study (a PROGENI study in the Old Order Amish). Finally, we will work with novel statistical models using conditional logic regression analysis to discover whether gene-gene and/or gene-environment interactions may affect important baseline and post-ASA platelet phenotypes.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] The dramatic rise in obesity and diabetes has fueled interest in understanding the influence of environmental factors on triglyceride (TG) concentrations. For example, the influence of a high fat meal on plasma TGs is dramatic and variable. Similarly, while drugs such as fenofibrate are, on average, efficacious for treatment of elevated TGs, therapeutic response varies considerably among individuals. Genetic variation is reported to play a role in both of these variable responses, although the specific genetic basis is not well understood. The goal of the proposed research is to identify genetic loci that determine gene-environment interactions that predict triglyceride response to two interventions, one to lower TGs (fenofibrate) and one to raise TGs (intake of a high-fat meal to induce post-prandial lipemia (PPL). In the current phase of this project, The Genetics of Lipid-lowering and Diet Network (GOLDN) study recruited and examined family members from pedigrees in two ethnically-homogenous field centers in Minnesota and Utah. Building on the work done to date, we will conduct the proposed study within a well characterized trial cohort. Specifically, we will: (1) Conduct genome-wide linkage analysis to identify QTLs for the response of TGs and TG-related phenotypes to fenofibrate, a fat meal, and a fat meal in the context of fenofibrate treatment. A large phenotypic profile was collected on all subjects, including NMR measures of particle size, RBC fatty acids, insulin, glucose, adiponectin, and inflammatory markers (CRP, TNFa, MCP1, IL2SR, IL6). Linkage analysis for the intervention phenotypes will be implemented using a mixed model approach implemented in a variance components model. (2) Characterize 2 linkage regions using gene-based dense SNP mapping and linkage disequilibrium methods. We will use linear mixed models with structured association tests to control for population stratification and FDR to correct for multiple testing. We will identify functionally relevant positional candidate genes within linkage peaks, and we will select the most relevant candidate genes for genotyping. (3) Conduct epidemiological and candidate gene association analyses to exploit the rich phenotypic resources of the GOLDN study. We will extend our statistical methods in combinatorial partitioning and neural networks to identify combinations of genes and/or environments that predict variation in response to fat intake and fenofibrate. (4) Replicate genetic associations for post-prandial lipemia measures identified in the HAPI-HEART Study, and serve as a genotyping lab resource to replicate findings from other PROGENI networks. Future studies will extend these discoveries by examination of the functional relevance of SNPs that are associated with TG-lowering effects of fenofibrate or TG-raising effects of a high-fat meal. Genotypic characterization of individuals who respond favorably to fenofibrate may enable targeted interventions to reduce TGs and identify the most effective treatments in clinical practice.

Approximately 2200 patients will undergo a baseline evaluation with randomization occurring in 1080. The study has 90% power to detect a 28% reduction in primary endpoint hazard rate.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a paucity of data on long-term results of dietary treatment for obesity. Diets emphasizing fat restriction, low carbohydrate or high protein intake are each promoted in popular books, but with little evidence to support one over the other for their short- or long-term use. The aims of the proposed research are to test the effectiveness for weight loss and weight maintenance of 4 diets differing in macronutrient composition: moderate in fat (35% energy) with two different protein levels (15% and 25%), and low in fat (20% energy), also with 15% and 25% protein. The moderate-fat diet will be patterned after a Mediterranean diet. All 4 dietary approaches will be low in saturated fat, and will involve reduction in total energy intake. All participants will receive a state-of-the-art behavioral therapy program standardized across the two centers. We will test the hypothesis that higher baseline insulin, RQ and VO2max will be associated with smaller weight loss and more difficulty maintaining the weight loss during maintenance. Dietary satisfaction and satiety will be assessed as potential predictors of success. 400 men and 400 women, BMI 27-39 kg/m2, will be randomized among the 4 dietary treatments. Each diet will be developed to be practical and suitable for public health recommendations, and would be expected to have a favorable effect on cardiovascular risk factors. The primary outcome variable will be change in total body weight from baseline to 2 years. Secondary outcomes related to obesity are total body fat, visceral fat mass, BMI, and waist and hip circumferences. Other outcomes include blood pressure, fasting blood lipids, apolipoproteins, insulin, glucose, and hemoglobin A1C. The results will be straightforwardly applicable to public health and clinical guidelines for obesity, and will increase our understanding of the biology of obesity and weight loss.',\n",
       " 'Over 11 million red blood cell units are transfused in the United States annually. Despite the common use of red  blood cell transfusions, the threshold for transfusion has not been adequately evaluated. A decade ago the standard  of care was to administer a peri-operative transfusion whenever the hemoglobin level fell below 10 g/dl (the \"10/30  rule\"). Concerns about the safety of blood, especially with respect to HIV and hepatitis, and the absence of data to  support a 10 g/dl threshold led to the current standard of care to administer blood transfusions based on the  presence of symptoms and not a specific hemoglobin/hematocrit level. However, there are no randomized clinical  trials in surgical patients that have tested the efficacy and safety of withholding blood until the patient develops  symptoms or of the \"10/30\" approachto transfusion and limited evidence for patients with underlyingcardiovascular  disease who are at greatest risk of adverse effects from reduced hemoglobin levels.  We propose to conduct a multi-center randomized trial to test if a more aggressive transfusion strategy that  maintains postoperative hemoglobin levels above 10 g/dl improves patient outcome as compared to a more  conservative strategy that withholds blood transfusion until the patient develops symptoms of anemia. Patients  eligible for the trial will have undergone surgical repair for a hip fracture and have a postoperative hemoglobin level  below 10 g/dl within three days of surgery. Only patients with cardiovascular diseasewill be entered into the study.  Symptomatic transfusion strategy patients will receivered blood cell transfusions for symptoms of anemia, although  transfusion is also permitted, but not required, if the hemoglobin level falls below 8 g/dl. Outcomes will include  functional recovery {primary outcome: ability to walk ten feet across a room without human assistance at 60-days  post-randomization), long-term survival, nursing home placement, and postoperative complications (death in hospital  or within 30 days, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, thromboembplism, stroke). We will-enroll 2,600 patients over  a 3.5-year period to detect a reduction in the loss of ability to walk independently from 43% to 36% (16% relative  risk reduction) with power about 0.90.  Also, this study will measure the frequency and 95% confidence intervals of medical errors that are important in this  patient population. The medical errorsthat will be measuredare: transfusion errors (blood transfusion to the wrong  patient, mislabeling of samples for type and cross match, use of whole blood instead of packed red cells), failure to  use thromboembolism prophylaxis, incorrect antibiotic prophylaxis, wrong site surgery, and femoral shaft fracture.',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] CAMPCS/3 is designed to follow patients with persistent asthma from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) trial for 4 additional years (through ages 21-29) to determine clinical and genetic risk factors for patterns of lung function decline indicative of chronic airflow obstruction in later adulthood. No other study of childhood asthma has the size, detailed phenotyping, and longitudinal follow-up needed to determine these risk factors. CAMP recruited 1041 persistent asthmatics to determine the effect of regular inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) on lung-growth. We are currently following 869 (83% of the original cohort) to determine predictors of attained maximal lung growth in early adulthood for persistent asthmatics. We have identified patterns of reduced growth arid evolving airway obstruction. Analysis of CAMP participants, aged 23 years or older, indicate that 28% did not reach normal maximal level of FEV1 even when measured after bronchodilation. We have also observed that 20% have already started to decline, with the mean age of decline 19.4 years. These abnormalities may be due to persistent inflammation suggestive of early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) Define, using a range of normal comparison populations, susceptible subgroups of patients with persistent childhood asthma who are at risk for patterns of reduced attained maximal lung function and of subsequent decline of lung function, 2) Identify genetic correlates of maximal attained lung function and early lung function decline (genetic analyses will be done by Dr. Weiss and the Center for Genetics and Genomics at Harvard, without cost to this application) relating existing genetic data on more than 700 trios of parents and CAMP patients to the detailed phenotypic data collected during all phases of CAMP, and 3) Determine effects into early adulthood of 4-6 years of prior continuous treatment with inhaled anti-inflammatory medications. Data collection procedures for spirometry and other procedures will be identical to those used in previous phases of the CAMP study. Annual pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry will allow accurate measurement of lung function. CAMP is the largest, most completely characterized cohort of children with asthma. Follow-up of this cohort in CAMPCS/3 will provide valuable information about the natural history of this important childhood lung disease, which can be used to identify patients with asthma who are at risk of chronic airflow obstruction later in adult life.

The study design is a prospective study of consecutive patients incorporating standardized inclusion/exclusion criteria, complete ascertainment of patient characteristics and outcomes, uniform diagnostic criteria, and unbiased central reading of imaging studies. Over a period of two years, 1256 patients with suspected acute PE will be recruited at 7 clinical centers. All patients will undergo clinically indicated tests to diagnose or exclude PE. This includes a validated clinical assessment, D-dimer by rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIS A), compression ultrasound of the lower extremities, ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scan, contrast enhanced spiral computed tomography (CT), and ultimately may include pulmonary digital subtraction angiography (DSA). It is expected that 317 patients will have PE and they will undergo gadolinium enhanced MRA. It is expected that 939 patients will be shown to have no PE. From among this group with no PE, 317 patients will be randomized for MRA (and venous ultrasound as well).

[unreadable] In order to meet this aim, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will draw upon its extensive experience with community emergency service providers, emergency physicians and cardiologists to actively collaborate with highly-qualified clinicians interested in OOH-CA and LTI at each regional clinical center (RCC). The Consortium will develop and implement standard definitions for diagnosis, and assessment of structure, process, and outcome related to OOH-CA and LTI to characterize their natural history, and response to interventions. The Data Coordinating Center will enhance an existing interactive information technology system in collaboration with a technology partner to facilitate communication and development. In addition, rapid and bias-free methods of randomization will be implemented by using an innovative software and handheld solution that has been developed and pilot tested. Robust, secure and confidential methods of data management and quality control will be used to provide a central repository for timely acquisition of data, so that prompt careful analyses can be conducted. Multiple strategies will be used to ensure timely and effective uptake of study results by policy makers, practitioners, and the public in order to improve EMS-related health care delivery in the United States and Canada.

Aufderheide, M.D. (PI).  PART 1: Housed within the adjoining FMLH and Children\\'s Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW) nationally recognized Trauma Centers, FMLH DEM coordinates MCEMS, including the Flight For Life Helicopter and 15 paramedic-receiving hospitals, treating 3,207 urban, suburban, and rural cardiac arrest and trauma patients annually.  This well-orchestrated and proven infrastructure provides centralized emergency physician medical control and on-scene monitoring for consistent delivery of MCEMS care and the implementation of out-of-hospital research protocols.  Dr. Aufderheide founded and leads the Milwaukee Emergency Medicine Research Consortium (MEMRC), an experienced out-of-hospital research association, supporting IRC interactions, continued research interventions, monitoring, and medical record review at all paramedic-receiving hospitals.  Dr. Aufderheide has conducted two out-of-hospital trials requiring exception to informed consent, engendering familiarity and support for this approach throughout the Milwaukee community.   PART 2: The Cardiopulmonary Arrest protocol proposal, \"Active Compression Decompression CPR and the Impedance Threshold Device (ACD/ITD CPR) for Improving Outcome in Cardiac Arrest,\" is a randomized clinical trial comparing hospital discharge survival rates and neurological outcome in patients treated with standard manual CPR versus ACD/ITD CPR. Pilot human data demonstrating significantly improved short-term survival supports the multicenter study. Increasing blood flow during CPR with this approach has the potential to save 36,000 lives worldwide each year. PART 3: The Trauma protocol proposal, \"Functional Quality of Life After Hemorrhagic Shock,\" is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study comparing functional outcome and quality of life in trauma patients with shock, randomized to receive hypertonic saline versus lactated Ringers as the initial resuscitation fluid. The type and quality of resuscitation affect mortality, quality of life, and neurologic outcome after hemorrhagic shock, as traumatic injury annually kills approximately 150,000 people, permanently disables 600,000, and costs society approximately $469 billion. Combining clinical and basic science, this translational research study will have significant impact by addressing this important national healthcare issue.',\n",

An experienced group of internationally renown investigators, along with the infrastructure and resources provided by the University with broad community support, are committed to advancing resuscitation science through the training of young investigators in the field of prehospital emergency care and the conduct of clinical trials.  This application sets forth 2 research proposals pertaining to management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and life-threatening trauma that exemplify the insights and expertise of the assembled team of researchers and the quality of the local prehospital care system.  The cardiac arrest proposal is a prospective, randomized, double-blind comparison of amiodarone, lidocaine and placebo in out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation that will assess the impact of such treatment on neurologically functional survival.  The trauma protocol is a similarly designed comparison of 7.5% hypertonic saline in dextran, 3% saline, and conventional fluid resuscitation on mortality and neurologic function after blunt traumatic injury associated with hypovolemic shock.  Each proposal will enroll between 400-500 patients over a two year period, and will have enhanced statistical power to establish their important endpoints through participation of a Consortium of clinical research centers.

Pittsburgh has assembled a multidisciplinary team dedicated to improving restoration of cardiovascular stability and minimizing brain injury. Unique resources include a strong working relationship with regional emergency medical services, one of the busiest trauma centers in the region, an integrated health care system, and a core of researchers focused on resuscitation. We have included plans to standardize care, assure protocol compliance, and perform detailed functional outcome assessment. We have mechanisms to control interventions for subjects in the field, in the emergency department, in the intensive care unit, in rehabiliation and at the time of functional evaluation. The baseline characteristics of cardiopulmonary arrest and traumatized patients are suitable for clinical research. We currently monitor the resuscitation and outcomes after cardiopulmonary arrest for over 500 individuals each year. We currently treat over 3600 trauma patients per year. Over 500 trauma patients per year have injury severity scores of 15 or greater, and about 150 trauma patients per year have fatal traumatic injuries using current therapy. Two concept trials are presented for the Consortium. The first will study (1) an increase in the number of chest compressions delivered per unit time and (2) different durations of induced hypothermia on survival and recovery after cardiopulmonary arrest. The second will examine the effect of intentional induction of mild hypothermia after trauma with hemorrhagic shock. A clinical research training core is also described for purposes of training a young investigator within the Consortium.',\n",

The proposal presents a plan to accelerate the translation of basic science discoveries from the laboratory to the \"curbside\" by setting up a dynamic infrastructure of scientists, paramedics, administrators, ethicists, and physicians who will develop and test innovative therapies.  The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To develop a multidisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in basic science, critical care, outcomes, medical error, knowledge translation, simulation, and clinical evaluative research who have the requisite skills to identify the most promising new therapies, to efficiently perform clinical trials to test these therapies, and then to translate these findings to the broader medical community.  2) To establish a partnership of teaching hospitals, University, and large regional Emergency Medical Services (EMS; Regional Land EMS and Provincial Air Ambulance Systems).  This partnership serves a population of over 8 million with an annual call volume of over 800,000 including over 5,000 cardiac arrests and over 2,000 severely injured adult and pediatric trauma patients.  These patients will form the catchment population to test specific resuscitation protocols in the context of a large multi-institutional network.  3) To use a unique mobile, paramedic-specific human patient simulator as a tool to test the feasibility of protocols, and train paramedics with respect to the therapeutic strategies that will be tested in the out-of-hospital setting.  4) To develop a program, which will train the next generation of investigators in research skills related to resuscitation medicine.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Given the extensive morbidity and mortality associated with injury and sudden cardiac death, evaluation of innovative therapies is warranted.  The reduction of mortality and improvement of functional outcomes through early application of therapies in the out-of-hospital setting is promising.  The time-dependent nature of resuscitation from both life-threatening injury and sudden cardiac death requires that evaluation of potential interventions in both of these disease states incorporate the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system. Successful scientific investigation of proposed prehospital resuscitation interventions mandates a mature EMS system with the following features: effective integration with state-of-the-art hospital care; established collaborative relationships between out-of-hospital personnel and hospital-based investigators; and comprehensive, prospective data collection beginning in the out-of-hospital setting and ending with postdischarge longitudinal outcomes.  This proposal summarizes the extensive EMS research experience of the multidisciplinary Emergency Prehospital Investigative Consortium (EPIC) team and details how the community and EMS agencies affiliated with the EPIC team meets the goals of this ideal EMS investigative environment.  The specific aims of this proposal are as follows:      -To use the EMS and hospital-based research infrastructure in the Portland Metropolitan Area and surrounding region to carry out advanced interventional resuscitation research on victims of major trauma and of cardiac arrest as part of the EPIC trial;   -To conduct a randomized, controlled trial studying the efficacy of hypertonic saline in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury; and   - To conduct a randomized, controlled trial studying the use of vasopressin versus epinephrine in out of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest.   - To describe a Research Skills Training Core that will foster the development of clinical researchers who will address future EMS and trauma/cardiac resuscitation concerns.',\n",

The overall goal of the proposed Collaborative Canadian RCC is to continue to conduct large resuscitation clinical trials that will improve the outcomes of victims of cardiopulmonary arrest and major trauma.      As a major partner in the Consortium, the Collaborative Canadian RCC commits to achieving all objectives of the Consortium with regards to cardiopulmonary arrest and major trauma.   a) Conduct large, collaborative clinical trials to evaluate interventions that will improve survival;   b) Strengthen existing research infrastructure in Ottawa/OPALS and British Columbia groups;   c) Produce methodologically robust research proposals for the Consortium;   d) Strengthen and further develop regional and national cardiopulmonary arrest and trauma registries;   e) Support potential emerging sites for resuscitation research in Canada (Cities of Calgary and Edmonton and Province of Nova Scotia);   f) Facilitate the training of clinical researchers in resuscitation and emergency medicine through a Clinical Research Skills Development Core.   In particular, the proposed Collaborative Canadian RCC has designed two specific resuscitation randomized controlled clinical trials for cardiopulmonary arrest and major trauma.   a) A Comparison of Fixed Versus Escalating Energy Regimens for Biphasic Waveform Defibrillation. This trial will compare the effect of fixed low-level energy (150 joules) to escalating energy (200-300-360 joules) regimens on the clinical outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest patients.   b) Prehospital Intubation and Ventilation Control in Blunt Head Injury.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Trauma Protocol: Hemorrhagic shock is a dominant cause of death after trauma.  The detrimental effects of assisted positive pressure ventilation (PPV) on cardiac output in hypovolemic patients has been under-appreciated.  PPV has not been recognized as a negative confounding variable in outcome.  Recent studies of severe hemorrhage show that perfusion and survival are significantly improved with lower ventilatory rates.  Ironically, emergency care personnel are still being trained to use high rates of PPV in hypotensive trauma patients.  Our central hypothesis: assisted ventilation rates commonly used in the pre.hospital setting adversely affect mortality and neurological outcome in patients with post-traumatic hypotension and that using a lower ventilation rate such as 6 breaths per minute will improve outcome significantly.  Specific Aims: To establish that survival and neurological outcome are significantly improved in cases of post-traumatic hypotension when emergency care providers deliver controlled rates of PPV as compared with the current practice of uncontrolled rates of PPV.  In addition, further improvements are gained using controlled ventilation rates of 6/minute compared with 12/minute.  Cardiac arrest protocol: Even when receiving standard, manual CPR techniques, most patients who have out-of-hospital cardiac arrest still die prior to arriving at a hospital. Many factors contribute to these poor survival statistics, including the inefficiency of the CPR technique itself.  CPR provides only 10% to 20% of normal myocardial perfusion, and only 20% to 30% of physiologically normal cerebral perfusion even when performed early.  In this proposal, we have selected what we believe is the most promising approach to improving CPR efficiency, patient survival, and neurological outcome following cardiac arrest.  This approach is the combination of active compression-decompression (ACD) CPR and the impedance threshold device (ITD), a technique termed ACD+ITD CPR, which enhances vital organ perfusion during the decompression phase of CPR. Specific aim: To determine whether ACD+ITD CPR will improve survival to hospital discharge and neurological outcome after witnessed, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults (primary endpoint) when compared with standard closed chest CPR.',\n",

San Diego County is bordered by a military preserve (Camp Pendleton) to the North, Mexico to the South, the dessert to the East and the Pacific Ocean to the West.  This clinical resuscitation research network integrates pre-hospital care, receiving trauma centers, and receiving hospitals for cardiac arrest into an organized network to allow population based pre-hospital research.  The USRRC is designed with critical EMS and trauma center leadership, resources to train paramedics in protocol implementation, and a data system to track patient entry and patient follow up.  The data system can be modified to accommodate research questions and additional data acquisition as protocols and research questions change.  A Clinical Research Skills Development Core is proposed and is supplemented by an existing Clinical Research Training Program at UCSD.  Together these will provide a rich opportunity to enhance training in prehospital clinical research for postgraduate MD fellows and young faculty in surgery, emergency medicine or cardiology.      The center proposes a trauma trial that will evaluate hypertonic saline/dextran (HDS) as a prehospital resuscitation fluid for hemorrhagic shock in patients following injury.  It is expected that this will alter the incidence of multiple organ failure and the mortality associated with multiple organ failure (MOF) by modulating the over-stimulated inflammatory system which follows hemorrhagic shock in injured patients.  MOF remains the late cause of death following trauma.  A second trial for patients following cardiac arrest evaluates the importance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients who are found down for more than 4 minutes following ventricular fibrillation.  It is thought that CPR prior to defibrillation may improve outcomes for patients following cardiac arrest with down times greater than four minutes.  There are adequate patients in San Diego County to complete these trials in approximately three years.',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Stroke occurs in 10% of children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and has a very high risk of recurrence without therapy. Affected children receive chronic erythrocyte transfusions to prevent a secondary stroke, which are effective but have limited long-term utility due to transmission of infectious agents, erythrocyte alloantibody and autoantibody formation, and iron overload. Transfusion acquired iron overload has morbidity and mortality for young patients with SCA and stroke, including chronic organ damage with hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, poor growth and development, cardiac arrhythmias, and early sudden death. Deferoxamine (Desferal(r)) chelation therapy is difficult to tolerate and leads to non-compliance an alternative to transfusions for secondary stroke prevention is clearly needed, which also addresses the issue of transfusion acquired iron overload. Hydroxyurea can prevent acute vaso-occlusive events in SCA, but its utility for cerebrovascular disease and specifically for the prevention of secondary stroke in SCA, is not proven. Our pilot data indicate hydroxyurea can prevent stroke recurrence in children with SCA, and after transfusions are discontinued, serial phlebotomy reduces iron burden. We propose a Phase III randomized clinical trial for children with SCA termed Stroke with Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea (SWiTCH). We hypothesize that hydroxyurea and phlebotomy can maintain an acceptable stroke recurrence and significantly reduce the hepatic iron burden. The primary aim is to compare standard therapy (transfusions and chelation) with alternative therapy (hydroxyurea and phlebotomy) for the prevention of secondary stroke and management of iron overload. Additional aims include comparisons of growth and development, frequency of non-stroke neurological and other sickle-related events, and quality of life. The use of hydroxyurea for secondary stroke prevention, coupled with removal of excess iron by phlebotomy, would represent a significant improvement in the management of patients with SCA and stroke. If hydroxyurea has efficacy for prevention of secondary stroke, it may also be beneficial for other children with SCA and cerebrovascular disease including those at risk for primary stroke.

The impact of HF on minority populations, such as Native Hawaiians (NHs) & other Pacific Peoples (PPs), is unknown.  NHs are known to have high rates of risk factors for HF & one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the U.S.  Access to appropriate care is known to improve health outcomes for HF patients, but access to specialist care presents a major barrier for NHs & PPs because they tend to reside in medically underserved areas.  To address HF disparities among NHs and PPs, a partnership program, the HF Disparities Program (HFD), will be established between the Queen Emma Clinic (QEC) and the Department of NH Health.

       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Over the past decade, there has been an explosive increase in obesity among all age groups within the US population.  This epidemic is particularly problematic among African-Americans in the Southeast. Although genetic factors play a contributory role, it is postulated that ethnic disparities in obesity and obesity-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) is related to a dynamic interplay between biological factors and the behavioral response to the unique environmental context within ethnic communities. Obesity is often associated with perturbations in the metabolic and physiologic milieu.  A cluster of obesity-related abnormalities has been defined as the \"Metabolic Syndrome\".  The CVD complications of obesity appears to be related to the capacity for adipose tissue itself to generate \"adipokines\" that   directly predispose to insulin-resistance, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and vascular disease. The proposed program will use state-of-the-art approaches to define potential ethnic differences in the profile of metabolic, physiologic and biochemical features associated with obesity as well as the salutary responses to lifestyle modification.  The proposed program uses a multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize potential ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD by drawing upon the fields of psychology, physiology, biochemistry, nursing and clinical medicine.  In a thematic series of inter-related studies, our Program\\'s research plan ranges from:  epidemiology studies within the ethnic communities, to patient-centered clinical trial interventions within ethnic community practices, tothe analysis of novel biomarkers of human pathobiology.  This collaborative multi-investigator team is built upon a complementary partnership between the Morehouse School of Medicine and Emory University.  This partnership shares a joint commitment to address the striking ethnic disparities in the high-risk CVD population that we serve.  The specific aims are:  Aim 1:  Define the relative influence of psychosocial/cultural factors and biological mediators as determinants of ethnic disparities in obesity and the metabolic syndrome in a population-based bi-racial cohort.  Aim 2:  Define the effectiveness of patient-targeted behavioral interventions to enhance the health of African-American patients with the   Metabolic Syndrome in the context of community-based clinical practices.  Aim 3:  To assess the impact of innovative lifestyle intervention strategies on conventional and novel biomarkers of vascular disease risk in African-Americans.  Aim 4:  To enhance the education/training of fellows/practitioners engaged in CVD disparities research/practice and promote partnerships that enhance cardiovascular health within ethnic communities.',\n",
       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in U.S. Hispanics.  The prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease is higher for Hispanics than for non-Hispanic whites and is increasing.  Hispanics face unique social, cultural, and language barriers gaining access to care.  These barriers are a major reason that Hispanics are less likely to receive treatment for cardiovascular disease risk factors.  For these reasons, improving the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Hispanics is the broad, long-term objective of the proposed research.      In response to NHLBI RFA HL-04-002, this project will develop a partnership between Denver Health (DH), a minority-serving healthcare system, and the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center (UCHSC), a research-intensive medical center.      The first Specific Aim of the project is to develop and evaluate an interactive computer-based tool to improve community-based recognition of cardiovascular risk factors and to improve self-management skills, including adherence with clinic visits.  The tool will be culturally-sensitive and bilingual.      The second Specific Aim is to test the ability of a nurse-based disease management program to improve control of risk factors.  Under this aim, DH\\'s unique computerized information system will be used to develop a registry of patients with hypertension, and to characterize patients\\' overall risk for cardiovascular disease and their risk for non-adherent behavior.  A randomized clinical trial will be used to assess the impact of a nurse-based disease management intervention in those at highest risk and with a history of non-adherence.  The intervention will be based on programs already in place at DH but will be modified in response to input from community-based focus groups.      Specific Aims 3 and 4 will seek to refine current cardiovascular risk profiling in ways specific to Hispanics.  Specific Aim 3 will assess ethnic differences in the relationship between traditional risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia) and pre-clinical markers of cardiovascular disease (left ventricular mass, carotid intima media thickness, and brachial artery reactivity) over time. Specific Aim 4 will assess the relationship among the traditional risk factors, pre-clinical markers, and a panel of circulating inflammatory markers.  Also under Specific Aim 4, a randomized, placebo controlled trial will assess the efficacy of \"statin\" medications to reduce circulating levels of these inflammatory   markers.      Specific Aims 5 and 6 will develop educational programs to increase the cultural proficiency of clinical researchers, increase minority researcher participation in cardiovascular prevention research, and assist junior DH physicians in developing research careers in cardiovascular prevention.

The impact of HF on minority populations, such as Native Hawaiians (NHs) & other Pacific Peoples (PPs), is unknown.  NHs are known to have high rates of risk factors for HF & one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the U.S.  Access to appropriate care is known to improve health outcomes for HF patients, but access to specialist care presents a major barrier for NHs & PPs because they tend to reside in medically underserved areas.  To address HF disparities among NHs and PPs, a partnership program, the HF Disparities Program (HFD), will be established between the Queen Emma Clinic (QEC) and the Department of NH Health.

       " \"The explosive epidemic of obesity that has occurred over the past decade has affected all segments of the population; but has had its most detrimental impact on high-risk ethnic populations. Despite the compelling evidence that obesity increases the risk of CVD mortality, the pathobiological pathways that mediate this increased risk remain to be further elucidated. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) has recently been defined to capture the cluster of characteristics associated with obesity and high CVD risk. We are intrigued by the paradoxical observation that African-Americans (AA) have a lower prevalence of the MetS compared to whites despite a higher prevalence of obesity and hypertension. This observation suggests that current clinical criteria fail to identify obese AA at high risk for CVD. Further research in ethnic populations is necessary to guide more effective preventive interventions. It is postulated that ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD involve a complex interplay between behavioral, cultural, socio-economic and biological determinants. The theme of this Morehouse-Emory Partnership Program focuses on elucidating the etiologic basis of ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and discovering new intervention strategies to ameliorate CV health in all communities. The proposed Program uses a multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and develop effective therapeutic interventions by drawing upon the fields of physiology, biochemistry, vascular biology, psychology, public health, nursing and clinical medicine. In a thematic series of inter-related studies, our Program's approach to elucidating ethnic disparities integrates the analysis of psycho-social parameters within the context of ethnic communities with the assessment of novel biomarkers and !assays of vascular function/structure that characterize differences in pathobiological pathways. This collaborative multi-investigator team is built upon a complementary partnership between Emory University and the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM). In accordance with the RFA, the Program has at least four research-specific and two training-specific aims within Projects the subprojectsI and the shared resource Cores. Each project/core involves the synergy of a joint effort with investigators from both institutions. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Define the influence of psychosocial/cultural factors and biological mediators as determinants of ethnic disparities in obesity and the metabolic syndrome in a population-based bi-racial cohort. Aim 2: Define the effectiveness of a patient-centered lifestyle intervention to enhance the health of African-American patients with the metabolic syndrome in the context of community-based clinical practices. Aim 3: To assess the impact of innovative lifestyle intervention strategies on conventional and novel biomarkers of vascular disease risk in African-Americans.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cardiovascular Health Study (GHS) is an NHLBI-funded cohort study of risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in adults 65 years or older. In the early 1990s, 5888 participants underwent examinations that included traditional risk factors and measures of sub-clinical disease. During follow-up, many exam components were repeated, and CVD events were ascertained. In response to an investigator-initiated proposal, the NHLBI has extended CHS contract funding (1) to implement a model for a transition from contract-funding to investigator-initiated research and (2) to enhance access to CHS data for future papers and ancillary studies by CHS and non-CHS colleagues. The proposed R01, designed to continue events follow-up, will provide a foundation for the transition. Current and future papers and ancillary studies using CHS data or stored specimens will have additional power and can be conducted more efficiently if a service events-core continues to collect and adjudicate CVD events and deaths in a standardized fashion. The proposed study will provide important information about the determinants of CVD in older adults. For adults 80 years and older, few data are available on CVD incidence rates, on risk factors for CVD events, and on differences among subgroups defined by sex, race and age. Structurally, the primary aims are: (1) to evaluate the incidence rates of and risk factors for CVD in older adults, including comparisons between blacks and whites, men and women, young old and old; (2) the evaluation of prognosis in inception cohorts of older adults with new-onset conditions such as heart failure (HF) and a trial fibrillation; and (3) the evaluation of associations between risk-factor change and the incidence of subsequent events. Questions of interest include: What are the determinants of the low CHD incidence in women 80 yrs and older? Do older black women also have a low CHD incidence? What are the determinants of CHD, HF, and stroke in adults 80 and older? Are risk factors different between men and women, whites and blacks? Do traditional risk factors and measures of sub-clinical disease continue to be powerful predictors of CHD, HF and stroke in those 80 and older? In this study, we expect to make over 20,000 phone calls to identify 6000 hospitalizations, 1000 deaths, 3000 events for detailed review, and 1500 new events, including 370 CHD, 300 stroke, and 450 HF. These new events represent an increase in the number of CVD events of 29% to 35% in whites and an increase of 40% to 49% in blacks. The data and specimens collected in CHS represent a major national resource for the study of health, aging, and cardiovascular disease in older adults. Additional events follow-up will not only provide the opportunity to address the aims of this study, but also enhance the power of current and future CHS papers and ancillary studies by CHS and non-CHS colleagues.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The purpose of this study is to determine a safe, effective, and systematic approach for the treatment of first isolation of Pseudomonas aemginosa (Pa) from young children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF).   There is significant interest in investigating anti-pseudomonal therapies in very young children with the long-term goal of delaying or preventing chronic infection that contributes to irreversible lung disease. There has been minimal evaluation of the long-term clinical and microbiologic efficacy or safety of aggressive early intervention (i.e., intervention based on first isolation of Pa alone, in the absence of symptoms). While anti-pseudomonal therapy for first isolation of Pa will likely result in short-term eradication of Pa from respiratory cultures, it is not known whether it will improve clinical outcomes, be associated with unacceptable toxicities, or increase the rate of acquisition of resistant organisms. In an ongoing effort to address these issues, young children with CF ranging in age from 1 to 12 years will be enrolled at one of 60 clinical centers nationwide in an 18-month clinical trial that will include approximately 300 children. The clinical trial is designed to allow randomized controlled evaluation of early intervention with inhaled and oral antipseudomonal therapy in young patients with CF at first isolation of Pa from respiratory cultures. The clinical trial will investigate two different antimicrobial treatment regimens: (1) Culture-based antibiotic therapy, i.e., treatment based on microbiology findings of Pa positive respiratory cultures, and (2) Cycled antibiotic therapy, i.e., treatment provided systematically in quarterly cycles until the end of the 18-month study period. Inhaled tobramycin and oral ciprofloxacin have bean selected as first choice antimicrobials for this trial, based on a consensus conference at which therapies were selected and ranked based on the amount of evidence and of safety data available.  The primary outcome of the clinical trial is the proportion of recurrent Pa positive cultures during the 18-month study period, comparing participants assigned to the culture-based treatment group with participants assigned to the cycled treatment group. Another key clinical outcome measure will evaluate the time to occurrence of a pulmonary exacerbation. The secondary outcomes will evaluate the effect of antibiotic therapy on safety (adverse events profile with particular reference to musculo-skeletal symptoms, renal function as measured by serum creatinine, hearing acuity, liver function tests, and complete blood count); clinical variables (occurrence of hospitalization during 18 months, proportion of patients with  pulmonary exacerbations, linear growth, weight gain, FEV1, and total inpatient days); microbiology findings (presence and pattern of mucoid Pa isolates identified by colony morphology, changes in MICs of Pa isolates from oropharyngeal cultures, and changes in the genotype of Pa isolates from baseline to the end of the study); and Pa serology (changes in and patterns of anti-pseudomonal antibody titers against Exotoxin A and other selected pseudomonas antigens).   In essence, this study will provide valuable  clinical and microbiologic efficacy and safety data regarding the use of antipseudomonal therapy in young children with CF, will  provide important data on the effect of PA colonization on subsequent health status, and will provide information on surrogate markers of lower airway infection.',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    [unreadable] The PACEmaker & Beta-Blocker Therapy Post-Myocardial Infarction (PACE-MI) Trial will investigate whether pacemaker facilitated beta blocker therapy decreases the combined endpoint of total mortality plus nonfatal reinfarction in patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction and have bradycardia contraindications to beta blockers. Currently, these patients are not treated with beta blockers due to the likelihood of developing potentially dangerous bradyarrhythmias from treatment. Because beta blockers are highly effective agents in reducing mortality and reinfarction post-myocardial infarction, particularly in high risk subgroups, there has been increasing emphasis on their use. The patients with bradycardia precluding beta blocker therapy could, in theory, be treated with beta blockers if a pacemaker is implanted first to provide backup rate support. As these patients have been routinely excluded from clinical trials, there is no direct data to support such a recommendation. The specific aim of the PACE-MI Trial is to test whether pacemaker facilitated beta blocker therapy after myocardial infarction confers a clinical advantage in this subgroup of patients. This aim will be accomplished in this multicenter clinical trial in which patients within one month of a myocardial infarction who have either bradycardia or heart block contraindications to beta blockers will be randomized to receive either standard therapy (which would not include a beta-blocker as these patients have contraindications) or standard therapy plus a pacemaker and beta-blocker. This specific aim has important implications in that it will: 1) Provide data to support (if the hypothesis is verified) a change in Medicare coverage policy; 2) Provide support for the treatment paradigm of pacemaker facilitated betablocker therapy; 3) Highlight the importance of beta blocker therapy even in the modern era of management of myocardial infarction, particularly in the currently under treated elderly population. The trial primary composite is total mortality plus nonfatal reinfarction. Patients enrolled in the trial will be followed for two years. The sample size will be 1124 patients who will be enrolled in 60 sites.   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Children with asthma are often treated for GER with drugs to suppress gastric acid production. However, this treatment is expensive, and with unproven benefit. The primary objective in this proposal is to conduct a multi-site, randomized, clinical trial to test the hypothesis that treatment of GER with lansoprazole, an approved proton pump inhibitor, will decrease the frequency of exacerbations in children with poorly controlled asthma.

Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with either lansoprazole or placebo for six months. The presence, severity, and relationship of GER to asthma symptoms will be determined with 24 hour esophageal pH monitoring, but randomization to treatment will not be influenced by the presences or severity of GER. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of participants who have exacerbations of asthma defined by diaries and interviews.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ongoing burden of cardiovascular disease emphasizes the need to develop new strategies to prevent and treat atherosclerosis. Several lines of evidence indicate that a significant portion of variability in risk for atherosclerosis is heritable. However, to date family-based linkage studies and candidate gene analyses have failed to discover genetic variants that account for most of this variation. Association studies are predicted to be more efficient than linkage studies to detect genetic variants that contribute to common complex phenotypes like atherosclerosis. However, in the past, adequate genome-wide association studies have been impractical due to limitations in genotyping capacity and incomplete documentation of the common variants in the human genome. Recently, these limitations have been overcome, making it possible to design association studies with excellent power to detect common variants contributing to disease risk. These technological developments, combined with the existence of several NHLBI sponsored cohorts with detailed phenotypic data on atherosclerosis provide a highly leveraged opportunity to search for genetic variants associated with early and extensive subclinical atherosclerosis. Discovering such variants could lead to new strategies for early identification of high risk subjects when aggressive intervention would be more likely to prevent the initial development of disease. In addition, identification of variants that predispose to atherosclerosis may suggest novel pathophysiologic pathways that could be explored as potential targets for new therapeutic interventions.

The broad and long-term goal of this PEN is to develop nanotechnology and biomolecular engineering tools and methodologies for the detection and molecular analysis of atherosclerotic plaque formation, which has a compelling medical need. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States: One out of every four Americans has cardiovascular disease, and every 30 seconds one person dies from this disease. Although significant advances have been made in the management and treatment of this disease, there is still a lack of understanding of the fundamental biology and pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, especially the molecular mechanisms responsible for plaque formation. As a result, early detection of atherosclerotic plaque is difficult, leading to a high rate of morbidity and mortality. We propose to develop advanced nanotechnologies for molecular analysis of plaque formation and sensitive detection of plaques. Specifically: (1) we will develop the molecule beacon based technology for mRNA expression and localization in living cells in response to shear stress; (2) we will develop quantum dot (Qd) based probes for studying protein interactions in cells; (3) the QD probes will be further developed for in vivo detection and analysis of plaques; (4) we will develop magnetic nanoparticle probes for in vivo plaque detection; (5) we will carry out a pilot project to develop LDL and chymase based contrast agent for in vivo plaque detection; (6) as a second pilot project we will develop activatable probes for detecting oxidative stress in living cells. Underlying this PEN is a strong track record of the senior investigators who have worked together successfully in attracting joint research grants. In addition, the Department of Biomedical Engineering, which was jointly established in 1997 by Georgia Tech and Emory University School of Medicine, has presented unique opportunity for research collaboration and skill training by bring bioengineering, nanotechnologies and discoveries into medicine and vice versa. If funded, this Program of Excellence in Nanotechnology will be housed on the Emory Campus and with a truly outstanding environment for collaborative and translational cardiovascular research and training. In additional to basic knowledge on cardiology, this PEN is expected to yield methodologies that can direct impact on clinical practice of early detection, diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] It is estimated that nearly 60 million Americans have at least one type of cardiac disease. One million of these people will die each year, many without the presentation of prior symptoms. In most cases these sudden cardiac deaths can be attributed to the physical rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, and the resulting myocardial infarct. Importantly though, only a subset of plaques are \"vulnerable\" or rupture prone. There is a major unmet medical need for new approaches for diagnosing, monitoring and treating vulnerable plaque. The long-term objective of this Program of Excellence in Nanotechnology (PEN) is to design nanodevices for the analysis, diagnosis,  [unreadable] monitoring, and treatment of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. The PEN is a partnership between The Burnham Institute (lead), The Scripps Research Institute, and The University of California at Santa Barbara. The Specific Aims of the PEN are to: 1) Select for Targeting Elements that can be used to deliver nanodevices to vulnerable plaque. The Targeting Elements will be based upon homing peptides selected by in vivo phage display with animal models of atheroma, 2) Build Delivery Vehicles that can be used to transport drugs, imaging agents, and nanodevices to sites of vulnerable plaque, 3) Design a series of Self-Assembling Polymers that can be used as molecular  [unreadable] nano-stents to physically stabilize vulnerable plaque, and to replace the fibrous cap with an anti-adhesive, anti-inflammatory surface, 4) Devise protein-driven Molecular Switches (MS) that can sense and respond to the pathophysiology of atheroma. The Molecular Switches will take advantage of the in-depth knowledge on the composition of atheroma and on its local environment, and 5) Devise Bio-nanoelectromechanical systems (BioNEMS) capable of sensing and responding to vulnerable plaque.  Ultimately the capability of these BioNEMS will be extended to incorporate diagnostic and therapeutic capability.      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] A multidisciplinary team of scientists, nanotechnologists and physicians will establish a Program of Excellence in Nanotechnology (PEN), with the central focus being research and educational activities related to \"Integrated Nanosystems for Diagnosis and Therapy\". This PEN will include investigators from the Schools of Arts & Sciences and Medicine at Washington University, as well as nanotechnologists from the University of California campuses at Berkeley and Santa Barbara. The central mission is the development of a group of well-characterized and versatile nanoscale agents that can be assembled, labeled, targeted, filled, and activated as needed for the combined purposes of diagnosis and treatment of various diseases of relevance to NHLBI. The overall experimental strategy will focus on biological models of acute pulmonary and systemic vascular Injury (in vitro and in vivo) to demonstrate the effectiveness of these agents. There are six specific aims for this PEN: (1) Preparation and assembly of programmed, integrated nanosystems; (2) Application of nanostructures for imaging at increased levels of sensitivity; (3) Imaging of gene expression by recognition of mRNA transcription products; (4) Application of the nanostructures for therapy; (5) Cross disciplinary education and training of medical and materials scientists, and; (6) Dissemination and translation of nanotechnology developments. Fundamental studies will be conducted to understand the potential roles and limitations for nanotechnology as applied to medicine, and a number of applied studies will work toward the implementation of well-defined nanostructures for diagnosis and treatment of acute vascular injury and inflammation, with validation in the lung and cardio-vasculature. General methodologies will be developed for the preparation and characterization of novel plurifunctional nanostructures that can serve as hosts for both diagnostic and therapeutic agents, and then be destroyed safely once they have fulfilled their function (Aim 1). Demonstration of enhanced imaging capabilities will be performed for radio-, MR- and optically-labeled nanostructures by positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance and optical imaging, respectively, whereby tissues are targeted via ligands for cell surface receptors (Aim 2). Intracellular targeting will also be developed to allow for identification and \"reading\" of mRNA, as a means to perform direct Imaging of gene products that are either unregulated in a disease state or that are the products of gene transfer (Aim 3). It is expected that these new approaches will be applicable generally as a new form of molecular imaging that eliminates the need for reporter genes. In addition to the imaging of acute vascular injury, treatment by the delivery of various therapeutic agents using an array of nanoscale materials will be developed (Aim 4). Critical to the success of this PEN will be the establishment of infrastructure for the education, training and mentoring of students and postdoctorals, through formal course, workshops and laboratory rotations (Aim 5), and to the establishment of an affective and broadly based mechanism for dissemination of results, procedures and programs (Aim 6). Through these initiatives, we will provide leadership for the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology that can impact clinical directives and capabilities through the 21st century.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable] The long term goal of the applicant is to develop new, validated biomarkers that will enable early detection of vascular disease. More than 65 million people in the United States are affected by hypertension. Arteriosclerosis (i.e., atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis) of the cerebral, cardiac, renal, and peripheral arterial beds is accelerated in the setting of hypertension and leads to target organ damage and  [unreadable] cardiovascular sequelae such as stroke, myocardial infarction, chronic renal insufficiency, and claudication. Currently available risk assessment tools have poor sensitivity and specificity. Validating new biomarkers of arteriosclerotic vascular disease will allow formulation of innovative preventive and therapeutic strategies to ultimately improve quality-of-life and reduce mortality. This application proposes to investigate the  [unreadable] relationship of 50 candidate proteomic markers in pathways of inflammation, thrombosis, lipoprotein metabolism, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress to 4 different quantitative measures of arteriosclerosis in African American (n = 1150) and non-Hispanic white (n = 1150) individuals belonging to hypertensive sibships, leveraging the excellent clinical research infrastructure developed as part of the NHLBI's Family Blood Pressure Program. The measures of atherosclerotic or 'macrovascular' disease available for this proposal include the ankle-brachial index and quantity of coronary artery calcification. The measures of arteriolosclerotic or 'microvascular' disease available for this proposal include cerebral leukoaraiosis assessed by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio. We will accomplish the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: We will develop robust validated assays for 50 candidate proteomic markers and using the validated assays, measure the proteomic markers in 2300 subjects belonging to the two ethnic cohorts. We will also develop and validate panels of 6-8 markers for multiplex assays.  Specific Aim 2: We will use a variety of statistical approaches including Principal Components Factor Analysis and (Bayesian and non-Bayesian) model-averaging to identify the best predictive models (from among the 50 proteomic markers) for each of the 4 quantitative measures of arteriosclerosis in the 2300 subjects belonging to the two ethnic cohorts.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable] The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common cause of acute respiratory failure characterized by severe lung inflammation, a high mortality and no specific therapy other than a protective ventilatory strategy. Studies of individual biological markers in small single center studies of patients with ARDS have revealed major alterations in the cytokine cascade, the inflammatory cascade and the coagulation cascade both in the lung and systemically in ARDS. Despite the wealth of information gained from these biomarker studies, no single biomarker can unequivocally diagnose ARDS or differentiate survivors from non-survivors. Because of the complexity of ARDS, new approaches and methods are needed that can address the clinical pathophysiology of ARDS at a more comprehensive level. Clinical proteomics is a promising approach that has recently been recommended by the NHLBI as an important future direction in ARDS research. The recognition of unique plasma protein profiles that can diagnose ARDS and predict outcome has the potential to be a powerful tool for clinical use, facilitating application of appropriate therapies and stratification in clinical trials. Furthermore, the analysis of a panel of protein biomarkers in a large population of patients with new statistical algorithms will improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of clinical ARDS. Based on the remarkable progress that we have made in identifying specific biomarkers in large well characterized groups of patients either at risk for or with established ARDS, we hypothesize that panels of new and existing protein biomarkers can be used both to diagnose ARDS in at risk patients and to identify patients with ARDS who are at highest risk of adverse clinical outcomes. To address these hypotheses, we will utilize a multi-disciplinary clinical proteomics approach that draws on our expertise in measurement and interpretation of biological markers, high throughput protein assay design, bioinformatics and biostatistics and cutting edge mass spectroscopy proteomic discovery efforts. This multidisciplinary team approach, combined with proven ongoing access to large clinical trial datasets will be used to target major areas of unmet need in both clinical practice and clinical research in ARDS.

There is a pressing need for development and validation of biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis and management of patients with lung disease. In particular, combinations of protein biomarkers that can be obtained non-invasively offer great promise. We propose to establish a multidisciplinary Clinical Proteomics Center in Lung Disease to rapidly develop and validate panels of protein biomarkers that can be used in diagnosis, disease prognostication, and treatment of pediatric and adult lung disorders.  [unreadable] We will base our program on large, well-characterized pediatric and adult patient populations, and extensive expertise in biomarker research. The Clinical Proteomics Program will consist of a phased model of biomarker development encompassing assay validation through retrospective and prospective clinical validation to large scale application. The phased development strategy has several advantages including careful, expeditious evaluation of novel biomarkers; reduction in panel size to the minimum that is clinically useful; and maximum utilization of previously existing national disease networks. Our specific aims will be to: 1. Establish a center with five cores (Clinical, Laboratory, Data Management/Biostatistics, Educational, and Administrative) to select, validate, apply and continually improve protein biomarker panels. 2. Develop specific protein biomarker panels aimed at predicting progression of disease, assessing likelihood and significance of exacerbation, and evaluating response to treatment in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Asthma, Acute Lung Injury, Chronic Lung Disease of Infancy, Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Cystic Fibrosis. 3. Create a local and national educational and skills development program for MDs, PhDs, MD/PhDs, Laboratory Personnel and Research Coordinators, in Clinical Proteomics and 4. Establish a national resource for investigators interested in developing protein biomarkers of lung disease.      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Prior clinical trials have found only 25-35% CV risk reduction using statin monotherapy (i.e., event rate 2/3 to 3/4 of placebo rate). The proposed study is needed to confirm whether statin-niacin combination therapy, designed to target a wider spectrum of dyslipidemic factors in addition to LDL-C, will provide a more substantial (>50%) reduction of CV events.  Epidemiologic studies confirm the high prevalance of atherogenic dyslipidemia and its impact on CV event rates. Preliminary clinical trials suggest that targeting these factors with dylipidemic therapy will reduce CV events. The proposed study will enroll men and women >45 years old at high risk of recurrent CV events by virtue of having established CV disease together with the two dyslipidemic elements of metabolic syndrome - low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) [<=40 mg/dl] and high triglycerides (TG) [>=150 mg/dl]. The proposed study specifically aims to test this hypothesis for the primary composite clinical endpoint of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (Ml), non-hemorrhagic stroke, or hospitalization for high-risk acute coronary syndrome with objective evidence of ischemia (troponin-positive or ST-segment deviation). A secondary endpoint is the composite of CV death, non-fatal Ml, or non-hemorrhagic stroke. The 3300-patient sample, to be recruited in 54 centers in US and Canada, will have >90% power for the primary endpoint, and up to 85% power to confirm a 29% risk reduction, relative to statin monotherapy, for the triple endpoint above. In summary, statins have little effect on HDL-C orTG, and only moderately reduce CV risk. AIM-HIGH is designed to confirm a substantially greater benefit from \"complete\" lipid therapy using statins plus niacin.      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Adult obesity has early antecedents, and date show that eating and physical activity behaviors are formed and set as early as 3 years of age, through primary socialization within families. Yet there are few, if any, obesity prevention programs that target children younger than 3 years of age. We propose a community-partnered randomized study to prevent early childhood overweight in American Indian (AI) children. A birth cohort of about 780 children from six Indian communities born over a period 18 months will be randomized by community to either a control (3 communities) or intervention condition (3 communities). The intervention comprises a community-wide intervention coupled with individualized family counseling to improve nutrition and physical activity in infants and toddlers. Nutrition goals are to increase breastfeeding initiation and sustainability, limit sugared beverages for infants and toddlers, and make healthful choices during weaning and solid food introduction. Physical activity goals include promoting motor development, limiting video/TV viewing and creating play opportunities for infants and toddlers. Intervention approaches and methods used in the pilot study on which this project is based will be combined with new formative data collected at the beginning of the project to enhance the intervention's feeding and physical activity components. Each component in the community-wide interventions will be collaboratively designed with the tribes, and tailored to each community's needs. Trained peer counselors will deliver the family interventions, during a series of 12 cluster visits, each covering a different developmental stage of the infant/toddler.

Large 5-yr clinical trials have found only 25-35% CV risk reduction using statin monotherapy (i.e., event rate 2/3 to 3/4 of placebo rate). Thus, this study is needed to confirm the more substantial (>50%) treatment benefit predicted for the statin-niacin combination by epidemiology and by preliminary clinical trials. The target population is men and women >45 years old with established CV disease and at higher risk due to the two dyslipidemic elements of metabolic syndrome (MS) -- low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) [40 mg/dl or less] and high triglycerides (TG) [150 mg/dl or greater]. The proposed study specifically aims to test this hypothesis for the primary composite clinical endpoint of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (Ml), non-hemorrhagic stroke, or hospitalization for high-risk acute coronary syndrome with objective evidence of ischemia (troponin-positive or ST-segment deviation). A secondary endpoint is the composite of CV death, non-fatal Ml, or non-hemorr-hagic stroke. The above hypotheses will also be tested among the very large subgroup of these patients who meet the current or future evolving criteria for metabolic syndrome. The 3300-patient sample, to be recruited in 54 centers in US and Canada, will have up to 85% power to confirm a 29% risk reduction, relative to statin monotherapy, for the rigorous triple endpoint above, and >90% power for the primary endpoint.  This companion grant describes the Clinical Trial Center for AIM-HIGH and methodologies for trial coordination, site identification, initiation, and management, data management and biostatistical support.

       " '   DESCRIPTION:  Knowledge of the genetic networks regulating heart formation is essential for developing rational approaches to congenital heart disease in children and to cardiac regeneration for acquired heart disorders in adults. Given the well-established conservation of developmental control mechanisms between human and various model organisms, considerable insight can be derived from genetic and genomic methods that are uniquely applicable to the latter systems. The present proposal uses genome-wide strategies to dissect the intercellular signaling and intrinsic factors controlling gene expression during Drosophila embryonic heart development, with a focus on integration of individual regulators to generate combinatorial specificity in the emergence of distinct cellular identities. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to identify large sets of coexpressed genes in cardiac cell subtypes and to characterize their expression responses to multiple genetic perturbations of heart development; (2) to computationally analyze transcriptional models of cardiac gene expression and to identify candidate motifs that confer cell type expression specificity; and (3) to empirically evaluate the functional significance of predicted heart enhancers and binding site motifs in order to extend and refine regulatory models of cardiac gene expression. Cells from the heart-forming region of the Drosophila embryo will be purified by flow cytometry after targeted labeling with a fluorescent protein, and RNA isolated from these cells will be expression profiled using DNA microarrays. These experiments will be undertaken both with wild-type embryos and with embryos that are modified by informative gain- and loss-offunction genetic manipulations, including mutations in the GATA factor Pannier which either completely block or cause ectopic heart formation. Microarray results will be validated by extensive embryo in situ hybridizations, leading to the identification of large numbers of genes transcribed in the heart primordium and differentially expressed in mature heart cell subtypes. These findings will be combined with existing information for known cardiogenic TFs to computationally predict heart-specific cis regulatory modules and novel associated sequence motifs. Such predictions will be validated by transgenic reporter assays, enabling refinement of the initial transcriptional models. Collectively, these studies will provide a detailed understanding of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying cardiac development.        ',\n",
       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasing among Alaska Natives. The Genetics of Coronary Artery Disease in Alaska Natives (GOCADAN) study has been examining CVD and its risk factors by conducting a family genetic study among Eskimos residing in eight villages and the town of Nome in the Norton Sound Region. This application proposes to extend the GOCADAN study to pursue the following aims: 1) Expand the genetic studies that will emphasize the genome scan approach. The completed genome scan of 1214 members who are nearly all part of one extended pedigree will be used to identify quantitative trait loci for subclinical CVD and CVD risk factors and narrow the regions of interest by fine mapping. 2) Re-examine the family members so that changes in risk factors can be analyzed and genetic effects on changes estimated. Surveillance for CVD events will be instituted, including annual mortality surveillance and follow-up of nonfatal events uncovered at the time of the re-exam. Advantages of GOCADAN include: 1) It provides health data on an underserved ethnic group. 2) The large extended pedigree improves the chances of detecting significant loci for subclinical CVD and its risk factors. 3) Data from carotid ultrasound measures will improve understanding of mechanisms of vascular disease and the genetics of CVD. 4) A unique constellation of risk factors with low rates of several risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, but high levels of inflammation and rates of smoking, provides a population uniquely suited to examine the roles of inflammatory markers in CVD. GOCADAN will lead to valuable therapeutic and prevention strategies for this and other populations in the United States and the world, where the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and CVD are increasing rapidly.',\n",
       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   GOCADAN (Genetics of Coronary Artery Disease in Alaska Natives) is a study of the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Eskimos in the Norton Sound region of Alaska. CVD and its risk factors are increasing rapidly in Alaska Eskimos as their lifestyle and traditional diets become westernized. During Phase I, we have collected family data on 1214 GOCADAN participants. Initial analyses of the Phenotypic data show a high prevalence of atherosclerotic plaque and self-reported CVD, in the presence of favorable lipoprotein, blood pressure, and insulin resistance profiles, but high levels of smoking, pathogen burden, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Our genetic analyses show that key CVD risk factors have significant heritabilities, and have detected pleiotropic effects on CVD- related phenotypes. Our initial genome scan has identified promising quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for CVD-related phenotypes including a QTL for diabetes on chromosome 2q, a QTL for lipid levels on chromosome 19, and a QTL for blood pressure phenotypes on chromosome 2p. Because the data collected so far raise many unanswered questions concerning the relatives contribution of genes and environment to the high prevalence of atherosclerotic plaque and CVD in this population, we propose to continue this study with the following specific aims: 1) examine positional candidate genes in proximity to CVD risk factor QTLs using Bayesian quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) analysis to identify genetic variation that accounts for our linkage signals, 2) continue genome-wide linkage and other quantitative genetic analyses of CVD-related phenotypes collected in Phase I and II examinations, including new phenotypes collected in Phase II, 3) assess the genetic contribution to changes in CVD-related phenotypes between Phase I (baseline) and Phase II (follow-up) examinations, and 4) continue to serve as the Data Coordinating Center and as a resource for Norton Sound Health Corporation, MedStar Research Institute and Cornell  Medical Center in the Phase II re-examination of family members. This study should prove invaluable in the identification of genetic factor that interact with lifestyle and diet to increase susceptibility to CVD in both Alaskan Eskimos and the general population. GOCADAN will lead to valuable therapeutic and prevention strategies for Eskimos and other populations, where the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and CVD are increasing rapidly.',\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorder, with a high burden among minority children. There is growing evidence that when untreated, it is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including neurocognitive and behavioral deficits, impaired quality of life, and cardiovascular and metabolic sequelae. The first line treatment is adenotonsillectomy (AT), which is the second most common pediatric operation, accounting for $500 million of annual health care costs. Despite the prevalence of OSA, its broad range of co-morbidity, and the frequency of surgical treatments, there has not been a single rigorously controlled trial that has addressed either the efficacy of the procedure or potential differences in treatment responses among vulnerable groups such as overweight children and ethnic minorities. To address this critical gap, we have assembled a group of expert centers in pediatric OSA, with a range of sleep medicine, otolaryngology, neurobehavioral, epidemiological, and biostatistical expertise to address the hypothesis that AT for treatment of OSA in children aged 5 to 9 years will result in improvements in health outcomes determined 6 months following AT. Over a 2.5 year recruitment period, we will enroll 460 children (50% minorities) with OSA from the otolaryngology and sleep referral clinics of four clinical sites (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Cinncinatti Children's Hospital, Kosair Children's Hospital, Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital), randomizing 50% to early AT and 50% to deferred surgery (with treatment decisions reevaluated after a 7 month observation period). At baseline and 7 months later, we will obtain standardized overnight polysomnography, morning and evening blood pressures, anthropometry, a fasting blood sample, and perform a comprehensive assessment of neurocognitive and behavioral functions. Selected clinical endpoints also will be re-evaluated at 12 months. Quality assurance for polysomnography, surgery, and neurobehavioral measurements will be directed by centralized cores at Case School of Medicine and the University of Michigan. Analyses will address whether AT is associated with improvement in attention and neurocognitive executive functions and sleep-related breathing disturbances, and whether changes in indices of OSA correlate with changes in other outcomes. Secondary analyses will address treatment effects on learning/memory, behavior, quality of life, growth, blood pressure, and biochemical indices of insulin resistance and inflammation. These will be the first data from a randomized controlled study, with geographic and ethnic representation, to address treatment efficacy for a common pediatric condition and to identify sub-groups, such as overweight children, with potential differential treatment responses. These data will be critical for defining treatment indications for a common surgical procedure, for identifying subgroups who require more intensive monitoring, and for understanding the co-morbidity of OSA.

The proposed DCC will provide administrative, biostatistical, data management and research computing leadership for this randomized multicenter clinical trial. The proposed DCC is uniquely positioned with experience-based scientific, technical and administrative leadership to coordinate and provide statistical leadership for this study. The DCC currently coordinates a study entitled Functional Outcomes of CPAP Compared to Placebo for OSA, an NIH-funded study in adults with obstructive sleep apnea, and is experienced in developing programs and systems to collect and manage the specialized data required for sleep studies, such as those resulting from polysomnography. To support this multicenter RCT, the DCC will provide the technical expertise necessary to design and implement data collection, quality assurance (QA), and reporting via a secure World Wide Web (www)-based data management system (DMS), deployed at the clinical sites on existing hardware, to facilitate data entry, verification, validation and query resolution, and data transmission over the Internet to servers at the DCC. This DMS will support subject screening and enrollment, randomization and data collection at the clinical sites, and tracking of subjects and data at the DCC. The DCC will execute procedures for data security and access, QA, storage, back-up, disaster recovery, and will provide periodic monitoring and QA reports. The DCC will provide the scientific design and analysis, logistical and administrative support by organizing meetings of Steering Committees, assisting with the development and distribution of the RCT Protocol and Manual of Operations, and providing the NHLBI Program Office, Steering Committees, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) with interim data summaries, interim and final statistical analyses, and collaboration on all scientific publications.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) This project will develop statistical methods for analyzing both genome-wide association studies and studies on multiple candidate genes, where the phenotype of interest is quantitative. The methods will include novel multipoint methods designed to extract the maximum amount of information from the available data, and methods for assessing significance of the results that deal effectively with the large number of multiple comparisons being performed in these large-scale studies. The proposed multipoint approach to association mapping are motivated by the fact that, even with a genome-wide scan of 250,000 SNPs, many SNPs affecting phenotype will be untyped. The idea is to assess whether an untyped SNP affects phenotype by first using surrounding haplotypic variation to predict plausible genotypes at the untyped SNP, and then assessing association between the predicted genotypes and observed phenotypes. The methods for assessing significance will be based on controlling the \"False Discovery Rate\" (the proportion of positive findings that turn out to be incorrect). The methods will be applied to a genome-wide scan (250,000 SNPs in 1,000 individuals) and candidate gene studies aimed at identifying genetic variants and genes responsible for differential response to statin drugs, and to data from a candidate gene study aimed at identifying genetic variants affecting quantitative phenotypes associated with atherosclerosis, plaque inflammation, and thrombosis, all factors associated with cardio-vascular disease. Findings from these studies may aid understanding of the genetic factors affecting cardio-vascular disease, and its treatment. In addition, user friendly software implementing the statistical methods will be developed and distributed, allowing other researchers conducting similar studies world-wide to have access to these tools. These tools have the potential to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of studies aimed at determining the underlying genetic basis of common diseases, potentially leading to new treatment strategies for maintaining health and preventing disease. Public health relevance: This project will generate statistical tools for analyzing large-scale studies that aim to help understand the genetic basis of common diseases and drug response. These tools have the potential to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of such studies, potentially leading to new treatment strategies for maintaining health and preventing disease.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Whole-genome association testing is widely cited as having promise for identification of genetic variants that are causal to elevated risk of complex disorders like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancers. The technology for genotyping at the requisite scale is becoming practical and affordable, but we lag behind in having the analytical tools needed to make the most reliable inferences from these data. This implies that we cannot yet design optimal studies, because we do not know what aspects of experimental designs erode the power of the studies.  Specific Aim 1 will develop Bayesian classification models, a promising approach for inference when the number of predictors (SNPs) is large, but where the prior expectation is that most SNPs will have zero effect. The model will have a three-component mixture prior with a high point mass at zero (no effect) as well as positive and negative effects on risk. Fitting will be done by Monte Carlo Markov chain and by stochastic variable selection. We will apply the model to BeadArray data, providing transcript abundance for 700 genes in cell lines from the 270 subjects of the HapMap project (each having more than 4 M SNP genotypes). The Bayesian classification approach will be contrasted with linear model based approaches. Both case-control and random cohort data will be addressed. Performance of the methods in the face of missing and erroneous data will be quantified. Specific Aim 2 will explore the effects of ascertainment bias and of departures from neutrality of the marker variation on association testing. The HapMap SNPs were discovered in small samples, resulting in a bias toward SNPs that are more common than are found in the full population. There is a pressing need to explore the impact of such ascertainment bias on inference of association. Most methods of association testing assume that the markers follow neutral expectations, but we know that many regions of the genome show marked departures from this pattern. We will show through theory and simulation how these distortions impact standard approaches to association testing, and devise accommodations to the test.  Specific Aim 3 will apply data reduction methods to both the SNP and the phenotype data. SNP data consist of discrete factors that arise through a well-understood process (the coalescent), and explicit modeling of this process is likely to identify better methods for SNP dimension reduction. Some beginnings of this have appeared in the literature as the \"tag SNP\". The phenotype data can be reduced by combining methods like clustering and sparse principal components. These methods will be applied to the Sanger gene expression data, and will be tested by simulation. Specific Aim 4 will employ simulations to assess the power of association tests under violations of model assumptions. Of particular interest will be the tuning model parameters to optimize the balance of false positive and false negative inferences.  [unreadable]   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)  We, as a society, have made tremendous investments in developing the scientific infrastructure to enable breakthrough discoveries on the primary biological risk factors for common disorders, such as diabetes, asthma, and cardiovascular disease (and related quantitative traits), that account for a disproportionate and growing share of public health care expenditures. While it is clear that the relationships between genetic variation and common disease phenotypes are complex, there is good preliminary evidence that identifying genetic risk factors for common disorders will improve understanding of their etiology and pathogenesis, leading to more specific and effective therapies. Moreover, since virtually all common disease arises as a consequence of the actions and interactions of both genetic and non-genetic risk factors, the identification of genetic risk factors should allow design of epidemiological studies to identify more specific non-genetic risk factors that might be cost-effective targets for prevention of disease. The recent development of high throughput platforms for very large-scale SNP genotyping makes genome-wide association mapping a viable additional tool in the effort to identify genetic risk factors for common disease. Effective use of this tool, however, will require considerable methodological development. Thus, we propose to develop (including software tools and web interfaces) and apply a variety of approaches for facilitating genome-wide association studies, including 1) improved allele/genotype calling algorithms for high-throughput genotyping platforms (to reduce non-random patterns of missing data), and 2) measures of information content for linkage disequilibrium mapping, analogous to those previously developed for linkage mapping. We will utilize these tools, as well as novel analytic approaches that we are developing, to conduct genome-wide association mapping studies on 3) more than 100,000 SNPs typed genome-wide in 350 Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes and a random sample of 350 Mexican Americans from Starr County, TX; and 4) more than 500,000 SNPs typed in 700 Hutterites with data on a variety of phenotypes related to metabolic, pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. Our proposal builds on long-standing collaborations in methods development and data analysis among members of our research team, which includes human, population, and statistical geneticists and statisticians.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genome-wide association studies are a powerful approach for the identification of common alleles that contribute to disease susceptibility and phenotypic variation in humans. There are many existing collections of human pedigrees that are well characterized and suitable for gene-mapping studies. Cost-effective genome wide association studies often will start by genotyping a subset of individuals from these large collections. In this setting, we believe that powerful association tests will incorporate not only the phenotype and genotype data of the individuals selected for high-density genome-scanning but also the phenotypes and more limited genotype information that might be available on their relatives.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] We have assembled an interactive and innovative team of investigators with a proven track record in the development of methods for the analysis of gene-mapping data. We propose to develop and evaluate parametric and non-parametric methods for whole genome association mapping. Our methods will be able to incorporate genotype data generated by the International HapMap Project and other public resources to \"fill in\" missing genotypes in individual studies. In addition, we plan to develop methods that can integrate high-density SNP genotypes collected for a subset of individuals in a pedigree with phenotype and genotype data that may be available for their relatives. All the tools and methods we develop will be incorporated into publicly available software.    [unreadable]   [unreadable] We are funded to undertake a genome-wide association study for diabetes and related quantitative traits using samples from the Finland-United States Investigation of Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM, FUSION). This genome wide study will involve genotyping ~250,000 tagging SNPs in 800 cases and 800 controls, with additional follow-up genotyping of the most interesting SNPs in 2200 additional cases and 2200 additional controls. The resulting data, together with genotype data from at least two other genome-wide association scans, will allow us to evaluate and calibrate our methods for association mapping.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Extensive genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are now available. Theoretically, we can systematically consider all the regions of the genome to identify those regions associated with disease susceptibility or unfavorable risk factors. Important issues need to be resolved however, before we can practically use all the genetic information in genome-wide association studies. Methods need to be developed to detect and resolve genotyping errors and we need new, analytical strategies designed specifically for family data that will account for multiple comparisons.    [unreadable]   [unreadable] Many large family-based studies, including our own, were initiated with the goal of first detecting linkage to identify chromosomal regions likely to harbor mutations having relatively large effects on important risk factors for heart disease. One of our studies, the Heritability and Phenotype Intervention (HAPI) Heart Study, includes extensive coronary heart disease risk factor data and 500,000 SNPs on 900 adults in Old Order Amish pedigrees. Our families are very suitable for genome-wide association studies and they offer special opportunities, compared to population-based samples, because families provide a direct test of allelic transmissions.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] This application addresses two specific issues pertaining to genome-wide association studies in families.  One relates to development, implementation, testing, and dissemination of efficient ways to clean and process genome-wide SNP data and then create haplotypes.  The other relates to developing analytic strategies that combine information from population- and transmission-based association tests to improve power, minimize false positive rates, and enhance efficiency for detecting SNP-trait associations.

Patient populations at these sites encompass both acute and chronic heart failure at all severity levels, and a wide demographic mix. The MHFC was formed in 2002, has a full time coordinator, and an established record of successful collaborative investigative and educational activity. Leadership and infrastructure are therefore in place to become a successful and productive Regional Clinical Center in the proposed network. Research proposals for the RFA include first a novel study in which the clinical and biological impact of a nondiuretic-based strategy of volume control will be compared with usual care in patients presenting with acute heart failure decompensation. The study will be initiated during hospital admission and continued for 3 months. Ultrafiltration will be used to achieve and maintain volume homeostasis in the nondiuretic group. The primary endpoint of this study is maintenance of stable renal function. Secondary goals include characterization of the relationship between numerous clinical and biological variables and the development of renal insufficiency in the post-discharge period. This study will therefore address several important questions regarding the acute and chronic impact of diuretic therapy on the development of renal dysfunction in patients with ADHF, represent the first chronic trial of a regimen for volume control not based on loop diuretics, and significantly expand the knowledge base regarding the behavior of several key clinical and biological variables on the clinical course of patients presenting with ADHF. The second proposed study involves the first test of the orally effective selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist clenbuterol in patients with moderate to severe, but stable chronic heart failure. The study will access the impact of clenbuterol, a promising agent based on preliminary experience in end-stage patients, on several clinical and biological variables in this population. These proposals therefore deal with timely questions, represent logical extensions of work with which MHFC investigators and sites have already obtained considerable experience, have the potential to either expand our knowledge of the role of existing treatment strategies or to substantially increase information regarding a promising new agent. Protocols to address these issues would be of suitable size for study in protocols of the size envisioned by the proposed network. (End of Abstract)  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Existing clinical trials have primarily focused on chronic HF in ambulatory patients, while a variety of other components of the HF syndrome, such as acute HF, advanced stage D HF, and HF with preserved systolic function, remain little studied and poorly understood. Additionally, the demographics of clinical trial patients often differ substantially from the broader heart failure population with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity.

The nine sites in the TMC RCC are in close proximity to one another (see Figure 1), and most are attached by skywalks and tunnels that facilitate the interaction and collaboration between the sites. The patient characteristics, experience in clinical research in heart failure and enrollment capacity for heart failure clinical trials at each of the participating institutions is outstanding. Finally, the proposed TMC RCC has a number of unique features that are ideally suited for the NIH heart failure research network, including close proximity of all participating Institutions to one another such that a single research coordinator can recruit from all sites in the TMC network, sufficient racial diversity of the patient population to ensure adequate recruitment of minorities and women, a mixture of community and teaching hospitals, pediatric and adult hospitals, and specialty hospitals (e.g. MD Anderson), each of which has a very high patient volume for adult and pediatric heart failure. Finally the TMC RCC will be overseen by Dr. Douglas Mann, who has experience with phase I - IV clinical trials, and who has close working relationship with of the investigators in the proposed TMC RCC by virtue of his 14 year tenure in the Texas Medical Center.

The participants are a diverse group of institutions in Northern New England, New York and Quebec, including the University of Vermont/Fletcher Allen Health Care (the sponsoring institution), Albany/St. Peter\\'s Medical Centers, Catholic Medical Center, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, McGill Medical Center and Univ. of Massachusetts Medical Center. The proposed RCC has a tertiary care catchment population over 6,000,000 and over 3,500 hospital beds. In 2004, over 2300 new patients with HF were seen, and over 180 follow-up patients with HF were seen weekly. The RCC also includes cardiologists in private practice in Vermont and New York who are committed to enrolling patients from rural areas who rarely participate in clinical trials. Key personnel have extensive experience in planning and management of multi-center trials and local PIs at each institution are experienced participants. Various collaborative activities are planned to maintain a vibrant regional network. The two proposed projects for the RCC share a. common theme, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) as a risk factor for and mechanism of HF. Project #1 is a placebo-controlled, randomized trial of a thiazalodinedione to treat diastolic dysfunction (DD), a common and  [unreadable] early manifestation of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Secondary outcomes are systolic dysfunction and changes in blood levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic biomarkers. Project #2 employs methods we have developed to study \"skinned\" strips of myocardium obtained during cardiac surgery as well as from endstage, explanted hearts. By using surgical biopsies, we can examine non-end stage disease states that can cause HF and delineate disease-specific elements of pathophysiology and drug effects. We will use these methods to determine the in vitro, disease-specific effects of the drug Alagebrium, a breaker of advanced glycation end-product (AGE) associated collagen cross-links, on passive stiffness in patients with DM, hypertension (HTN) and DM + HTN. AGEs are thought to cause increased myocardial and vascular stiffness in these patients. Results will be correlated with pre-operative DD and assessment of AGEs by immuno electronmicroscopy. The studies we propose for our RCC have potential to reduce the risk of HF in patients with DM. Biopsy studies will improve understanding of pathophysiology and drug effects and mechanisms.

The HF Network will be structured to have up to eight regional clinical centers to perform multiple clinical studies and one Data Coordinating Center (DCC). The network will provide the necessary infrastructure to develop, coordinate, and conduct multiple concurrent studies and facilitate the efficient application of emerging basic science discoveries into well-designed clinical investigations.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) proposes to serve as the Data Coordinating Center for the HF Network. In this role, the DCRI will coordinate and manage the clinical research and organizational activities of the HF Network. Using our extensive research experience and infrastructure, we will assist in developing study protocols, monitoring data collection activities, providing protocol-specific training of clinical centers, and performing state-of-the-art statistical analyses. We have assembled a team of experts in biostatistics, cardiology (including heart failure), and clinical trials to ensure that scientifically defensible and clinically meaningful conclusions can be drawn. We will promote the progress of the HF Network through a wide-variety of interfaces including web-based technologies, national cardiology and heart failure meetings, and scientific publications.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] To achieve the objectives of the HF Network, the DCRI will focus on the following activities: (1) study coordination and planning, (2) study design and protocol development, (3) site management, monitoring for quality assurance, and regulatory requirements, (4) data management and reporting activities, (4) statistical data analysis, and (5) publication and dissemination of results.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Through its vast experience in coordinating other cardiology and heart failure trials, and through the services it will provide to the HF Network, the DCRI as the DCC will be a vital resource in the successful establishment of this important network.

Patients with congestive heart failure have significantly reduced survival and quality of life. Multiple new strategies for the treatment of congestive heart failure are being developed, many of them involving complex strategies, including some that hope to regenerate the heart. Progress in transforming these treatment strategies from ideas to clinical practice is hampered by a lack of a network of sophisticated clinical researchers possessing the infrastructure required to test these complex strategies. The NIH has decided to form a Heart Failure Research Network of to address this challenge. The Canadian East-West Network is proposing to join the NIH Network to help it attain its goals of bringing innovative experimental strategies for the treatment of heart failure from the laboratory to the bedside. The Canadian East-West Network is made up of 19 university hospital centers, 7 large regional hospital centers, and 18 regional hospital centers. Together they treat over 10,000 patients with heart failure, of which around 25% are new patients a year. Their university hospital centers have the sole tertiary responsibility for 13.5 million people, and share in the tertiary care responsibility of another 10 million people. All major hospitals caring for the 8 million people in the province of Quebec take part in the Network. The Canadian East-West Network has a number of special attributes, and brings with it expertise that would be helpful to the NIH network as a whole. Its members belong to a single payer socialized medical system, which facilitates patient follow-up and data generation. It has a long and successful tradition of working with the NIH, it has an experienced clinical research coordinating center, and some of its members have worked successfully as a network for nearly  [unreadable] twenty years. The Canadian East-West Network brings with it a web-based electronic patient record that it has developed and is willing to share, a cutting edge pharmacogenomics center, expertise in blood sampling, transportation and measurement, and two implantable artificial heart programs. The Canadian East-West Network proposes a project using pharmacogenomics to identify which patients are most and least likely to benefit from a given medication, and a second project that will compare the ability of two types of a patients own stem cells in regenerating their heart after a large myocardial infarction (heart attack).

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Myocardial dysfunction and resulting low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) contribute significantly to postoperative morbidity and mortality in pediatric heart surgery. Despite major advances in diagnostic accuracy and intra-operative myocardial protection strategies, LCOS remains an important clinical problem with an estimated incidence of ~25% in infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. This application proposes a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, to investigate whether preoperative administration of glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone, steroids) and/or erythropoietin (EPO) will afford protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury and thereby reduce the incidence of LCOS for infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Furthermore, although there are important interactions between these two agents, the primary signaling pathways are distinct; hence, combined use may result in a synergistic reduction in the incidence of LCOS. There will be four preoperative treatment arms: 1) placebo; 2) steroids; 3) EPO; and 4) steroids and EPO combined. The study design assumes that intra-operative steroids will be administered.  This assumption is based on a recent published survey documenting this as common practice in pediatric centers, and our own investigations that demonstrate an improved benefit from pre- and intraoperative steroid use. The Primary Aim of the proposed study is to compare the effect of preoperative steroids and/or EPO with placebo on LCOS incidence through the first 48 hours following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Hypotheses to be tested include: 1) Preoperative steroids protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury to enhance myocardial performance postoperatively, resulting in a lower incidence of LCOS. 2) Preoperative EPO protects cardiomyocytes during ischemia-reperfusion, resulting in improved myocardial performance postoperatively with a subsequent reduction in the incidence of LCOS. 3) Concurrent administration of preoperative steroids and EPO will have a synergistic effect to reduce the incidence of LCOS. The Primary Outcome is LCOS. The diagnosis of LCOS will be based on a composite of clinical signs and symptoms, biochemical markers, and the need for additional inotropic/mechanical support. Five Secondary Aims will assess treatment effects on mortality and clinical measures of morbidity, postoperative myocardial performance, inflammatory and non-inflammatory mediators of myocardial dysfunction pre- and post-heart surgery, cardiomyocyte protection and apoptosis pre- and post-cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and the incidence of renal injury within 48 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Completion of the proposed studies should greatly improve our understanding of ischemia-reperfusion injury and therapies to prevent LCOS following surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in infants.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The technology to simultaneously genotype hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a single assay has only recently been developed and has the potential to revolutionize our ability to identify disease-associated genes in complex diseases. Specifically, high density SNP genotyping opens the possibility for case-control genome-wide association studies whereby SNPs that are evolutionary associated with a complex multigenic disease, and also in close physical proximity to a functional mutation, can be discovered. The major drawback of genome-wide association studies is that they require hundreds to thousands of cases and well matched controls for sufficient powering. This type of study is expected to cost millions of dollars using individual genotyping. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop cost effective design strategies and accompanying analysis tools for genome-wide case-control SNP association studies using pooled genomic DNA.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] We will develop new analysis tools and design strategies for genome-wide association studies using our unparalleled access to high-density genome-wide SNP genotyping data. Within the past six months, we have conducted genome-wide microarray SNP scans on over 5,000 samples. We are currently an early access site for the Affymetrix 500K Mapping array and have already completed two genome-wide scans on pooled DNA using this platform, verifying a previously known disease locus for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and identifying several new loci. We will have access to datasets from multiple genome-wide association studies on pooled genomic DNA including hypertension, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), autism, bipolar disorder, melanoma, PSP, memory, and diabetes. For AD, we will have access to both pooled and individual genotypes for 500K+ SNPs in 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls. Additionally, we have included funding within this proposal for genome-wide association studies on pooled genomic DNA for samples and diseases as decided by the steering community. In the course of this study, we will deliver web-based content and software tools that: (1) aid in the overall design of genome-wide association studies whereby using pooled genomic DNA is one approach; (2) provide quality control metrics for genotyped samples; and (3) automate analysis of a genome-wide association study data from pooled genomic samples.

Humane pediatric intensive care often includes sedation management. Although there are clear benefits in using sedation in pediatric patients who are unable to understand the imperative nature of critical care instrumentation and immobility, sedative use is associated with iatrogenic injury. Specifically, the medications used for sedation may depress spontaneous ventilation and prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation. Over time, drug tolerance develops and may precipitate iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome when sedation is no longer necessary. Prolonging the duration of mechanical ventilation and iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome add to the personal and financial burden of intensive care. This cluster randomized clinical trial will test an innovative approach to sedation management that includes: [a] team education and consensus on the use of sedatives in pediatric patients supported on mechanical ventilation, [b] team identification of the patient's trajectory of illness and daily prescription of a sedation goal, [c] a Nurse-Implemented Goal-Directed Comfort Algorithm that guides moment-to-moment titration of opioids and benzodiazepines, and [d] team feedback on sedation management performance. The intervention is an organizational change directed at all PICU clinicians. The unit of randomization is the PICU, the unit of inference is the patient, and we will control for center effects. Eighteen pediatric intensive care units (9 randomized to the sedation management intervention and 9 to continue to provide usual care) will enroll 2754 critically-ill infants and children supported on mechanical ventilation. We believe that patients managed per sedation protocol will experience fewer days of mechanical ventilation, less sedative exposure, fewer iatrogenic withdrawal symptoms, a shorter intensive care length of stay, less costs, and experience a better post-discharge quality of life and emotional health.

       " '  [unreadable] Description (provided by applicant): Temporary interruption of warfarin therapy for an elective surgical or other invasive procedure is a common clinical problem, affecting ~400,000 patients in North America annually. Increasingly, clinicians employ a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as a \\'bridge\\' before and after surgery or a procedure, when warfarin is withheld and anticoagulation is otherwise sub-therapeutic. This empiric strategy has several drawbacks, including lack of proven efficacy to prevent arterial thromboembolism, additional cost to the healthcare system, and the potential for increased peri-operative bleeding. Unfortunately, there are no high-quality clinical trials to provide Level 1A evidence to guide patient care. We hypothesize that simply withholding warfarin in the perioperative setting for patients with atrial fibrillation will not meaningfully increase the risk for arterial thromboembolism, and will forestall hemorrhagic complications, compared to a strategy using LMWH before and after surgery. To address this important question, we propose a multi-center, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that randomly allocates 3,282 patients with atrial fibrillation to either therapeutic dose LMWH or matching placebo before and after surgery (1641 patients per arm). Forty enrolling centers in North America will recruit over 44 months. Exclusion criteria include: mechanical heart valve; recent stroke or major bleed; severe renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia; or planned surgery that precludes use of post-operative therapeutic-dose LMWH. Primary efficacy outcome is arterial thromboembolism (stroke, TIA, or systemic embolism), and primary safety outcome is major bleeding (symptomatic, clinically-overt, or fatal). We will conduct a non-inferiority efficacy analysis to demonstrate that \"no bridging\" has a risk for arterial thromboembolism equal to a bridging strategy. Clinical outcomes will be analyzed using the per protocol population for the efficacy outcome and the intention-to-treat population for the safety endpoint. Dissemination of trial results will target physicians and other providers who manage patients with atrial fibrillation on chronic warfarin therapy. This randomized trial comparing bridging therapy to a \"no bridging\" strategy will establish a clear standard-of-care for the management of these patients. This application is in companion application to the Statistical Data Coordinating Center submitted separately.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Clinicians frequently use low-molecular weight heparin as a \\'bridge\\' before and after an elective procedure for patients on chronic warfarin therapy. It is unknown if this practice is efficacious, however, and it may actually result in an increased risk for periprocedural hemorrhage. This prospective, randomized, double-blind study will definitively answer this question for patients with atrial fibrillation who are on warfarin therapy.

We have partnered with Boston HealthNet, a network of 10 community health centers that provide care to low income and racial/ethnic minority populations, and will conduct a practical clinical trial that will allow us to address issues of effectiveness, generalizability, cost and sustainability and potential for wide-scale dissemination. A key goal of the intervention design has been to use multiple health information technologies to maximize the maintenance of behavior change and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. 624 Obese, lower income, predominately racial/ethnic minority health center patients who have been diagnosed with hypertension will be enrolled and randomized into one of three conditions: (1) Usual care (UC) plus the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight brochure; (2) Lifestyle modification with electronic supports (ES), which includes a weight loss 'prescription', skills training and self-monitoring for patients, with all intervention strategies delivered through interactive, phone-based, and print methods, without personal contact but with strong linkages to primary care; and (3) Lifestyle modification with electronic support plus interpersonal and socio- environmental support (ES + SS) provided by community health workers and through linkages to community resources. The conditions have been selected to determine if a multi-level interpersonal component increases the cost-effectiveness of the automated intervention. The primary outcome is weight loss measured at 2 years (intermediate assessments at 6, & 12 months). We aim for a 7% weight loss at 24 months in condition 3 (ES+SS) vs. usual care, based on the changes achieved in the diabetes prevention trial. We assume that condition 2 (ES) will achieve half this level of weight loss over 24 months. 208 patients per condition gives us 80% power after Bonferroni correction to evaluate the weight changes between the three groups. In addition to the primary analysis we will also evaluate the role of mediators and using the RE- AIM theory to implement a multi-faceted dissemination plan and to report on key issues such as moderator characteristics at both practice/clinician and patient/social environmental level.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Obesity affects more than 30% of adult Americans. In addition, nearly one-quarter meet criteria for the metabolic syndrome, which increases their risks of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular mortality. The loss of 5% or more of initial weight, combined with increased physical activity, significantly reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and ameliorates the metabolic syndrome and its individual components (i.e., elevated waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose or triglycerides; decreased HDL cholesterol). The benefits of weight loss have been demonstrated principally in efficacy studies conducted at academic medical centers. Interventions have provided intensive treatments (generally without concern for cost) that typically could not be delivered in primary care practice or afforded by most individuals seeking weight loss. The goal of this study is to improve the management of obesity in primary care practice by enlisting office-based physicians and auxiliary health providers (such as nursing assistants) who will be trained to provide weight management. A total of 360 overweight and obese persons at 9 primary care practices in the University of Pennsylvania Health System will be randomly assigned to one of three 2-year interventions: 1) Minimal Care; 2) Brief Lifestyle Counseling; or 3) Enhanced Brief Lifestyle Counseling. Each site, following a 1-year study initiation training, will enroll 40 individuals with a BMI > 27 kg/m2 plus two or more components of the metabolic syndrome. Participants in the Minimal Care condition (N=120) will receive educational materials distributed by a primary care provider (PCP) at approximately quarterly visits. In addition to quarterly PCP visits, participants in the Brief Lifestyle Counseling condition (N=120) will have 12 brief (10 minutes) visits during the first year with an auxiliary health provider (e.g., nursing assistant) who will review participants' progress in consuming a 1200-1500 kcal/d diet and walking 180 minutes/week. Twelve additional contacts, on-site or by telephone, will be provided the second year. Participants in the Enhanced Lifestyle Counseling condition (N=120) will receive the same intervention as those in the second group. However, they also will be given the choice of using either meal replacements or a weight loss medication to facilitate the induction and maintenance of weight loss. The study's principal hypothesis is that participants in the Enhanced Lifestyle group will achieve significantly greater reductions in BMI, at 1 and 2 years, than will persons in the Brief Lifestyle Counseling condition, which, in turn, will be superior to Minimal Care. A similar pattern of findings is anticipated in the resolution of the metabolic syndrome (and its individual components). Secondary analyses will compare changes among groups in mood, quality of life, and sexual function. Costs and patient satisfaction associated with the three interventions will be determined. This study holds promise of identifying effective weight loss methods that can be provided in primary care, at reasonable cost, by existing office personnel.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] An extensive body of evidence from efficacy trials, including several behavioral intervention trials conducted by the Hopkins investigators, has documented that weight loss is achievable. However, primary care providers typically had no direct involvement in the interventions. We propose a 3 group, randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of two integrated clinical-behavioral interventions (ICBIs). Participants will be 300 overweight or obese individuals with medication-treated hypertension, who are patients at two primary care clinics. The comparison group, as well as both ICBIs, will receive an evidence-based program to improve hypertension control. One ICBI, termed ICBI-IP, is a multi-channel intervention with in-person visits delivered by health counselors at the Hopkins center. This intervention is similar to traditional in-person interventions tested in efficacy trials; however, some in-person contacts are replaced with other types of contacts (telephone, web, email) in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The other ICBI, termed ICBI-Remote, is a multi-channel intervention (telephone, web, email) without in-person visits implemented by trained counselors of Healthways, Inc, a leading Disease Management company. This research effort builds upon previous research conducted by the investigators. Both ICBIs will be theory-guided interventions, adapted from PREMIER, an efficacy trial in which interventions lowered weight and controlled hypertension. Each ICBI will implement well-established behavioral techniques to accomplish weight loss, and each will use a web-based tool to facilitate communication among counselors, participants and clinicians; self- monitoring by participants; and feedback by counselors and clinicians. Both ICBIs will actively engage primary care providers. The primary outcome variable will be BMI and the secondary outcome hypertension control. Both ICBI should reduce weight. Critical questions are the extent of weight loss from each program. ICBI-IP might reduce weight to a greater extent than ICBI-Remote. Still, ICBI-Remote should be less expensive and more flexible. ICBI-IP could be implemented in a variety of settings (e.g. wellness programs, large clinics), while ICBI-Remote has the advantage of being readily 'scalable', that is, if successful, it could be rapidly implemented.

       " '  [unreadable] Description (provided by applicant): Temporary interruption of warfarin therapy for an elective surgical or other invasive procedure is a common clinical problem, affecting ~400,000 patients in North America annually. Increasingly, clinicians employ a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as a \\'bridge\\' before and after surgery or a procedure, when warfarin is withheld and anticoagulation is otherwise sub-therapeutic. This empiric strategy has several drawbacks, including lack of proven efficacy to prevent arterial thromboembolism, additional cost to the healthcare system, and the potential for increased peri-operative bleeding. Unfortunately, there are no high-quality clinical trials to provide Level 1A evidence to guide patient care. We hypothesize that simply withholding warfarin in the perioperative setting for patients with atrial fibrillation will not meaningfully increase the risk for arterial thromboembolism, and will forestall hemorrhagic complications, compared to a strategy using LMWH before and after surgery. To address this important question, we propose a multi-center, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that randomly allocates 3,282 patients with atrial fibrillation to either therapeutic dose LMWH or matching placebo before and after surgery (1641 patients per arm). Forty enrolling centers in North America will recruit over 44 months. Exclusion criteria include: mechanical heart valve; recent stroke or major bleed; severe renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia; or planned surgery that precludes use of post-operative therapeutic-dose LMWH. Primary efficacy outcome is arterial thromboembolism (stroke, TIA, or systemic embolism), and primary safety outcome is major bleeding (symptomatic, clinically-overt, or fatal). We will conduct a non-inferiority efficacy analysis to demonstrate that \"no bridging\" has a risk for arterial thromboembolism equal to a bridging strategy. Clinical outcomes will be analyzed using the per protocol population for the efficacy outcome and the intention-to-treat population for the safety endpoint. Dissemination of trial results will target physicians and other providers who manage patients with atrial fibrillation on chronic warfarin therapy. This randomized trial comparing bridging therapy to a \"no bridging\" strategy will establish a clear standard-of-care for the management of these patients. This application is in companion application to the Statistical Data Coordinating Center submitted separately.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Clinicians frequently use low-molecular weight heparin as a \\'bridge\\' before and after an elective procedure for patients on chronic warfarin therapy. It is unknown if this practice is efficacious, however, and it may actually result in an increased risk for periprocedural hemorrhage. This prospective, randomized, double-blind study will definitively answer this question for patients with atrial fibrillation who are on warfarin therapy.

       " 'Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of U.S.morbidity and mortality, and 10% of the U.S.population over 65 y has been diagnosed with chronic heart failure (CHF). Transplantation of stem cells improves left ventricular function (LVEF) in animal models of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)and CHF. Recent evidence shows that this strategy with whole bone marrow (wBM)preparations may improve LVEF in patients with AMI. Studies with wBM and skeletal myoblasts (SKMB) have yielded promising results suggesting improvement of LVEF in CHF patients. To further translate the findings of our group and others into clinical practice we seek to participate in the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN). This network will lead the field in developing and implementing cell therapy for the treatment of cardiac dysfunction. Great advances have been achieved towards developing, understanding and implementing cell therapy. Recent findings in clinical trials using wBM have highlighted the need for well planned trials that focus on appropriate populations, have rigorous cell preparation, and ask important questions critical to advance the field while assuring patient safety. We believe a collaborative center in Greater Cleveland would be an excellent site for this NHLBI CCTRN. Cell based clinical trials already performed in the Cleveland area include the RECOVER trial that studied the role of G-CSF in patients with AMI and moderate to severe LV dysfunction, and participation in completed and on-going multi-center clinical trials testing SKMB in CHF. This proposal represents a cohesive group of investigators interested in developing a center at Case Western Reserve University that leverages the broad expertise that is present in the Greater Cleveland area including: expertise in multi-center cardiovascular trials, non-invasive cardiac imaging, and non-invasive arrhythmogenic risk assessment. Our Network site will draw patients from diverse hospital centers in the community as well as tertiary care centers. Our group has been studying the potential of allogeneic multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC)-based therapy for improving LVEF following AMI. Allogeneic MAPC therapy for acute Ml is enticing because MAPC can undergo expansion in culture to > 70 doublings generating, from a single donor, a thousand doses that could be available whenever the patients present. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 we will determine the efficacy of allogeneic MAPC in patient with AMI. We also have a program to define the mechanism of stem cell homing to injured myocardium. We have shown that the transient re-establishment of the stem cell homing molecule SDF-1is sufficient to induce homing, vasculogenesis and recovery of myocardial function in preclinical models of CHF. In SPECIFIC AIM2 we will test the feasibility of cell based gene therapy and demonstrate whether transient re-establishment of signaling for stem cell homing to myocardial tissue is an efficacious therapy for patients with Class III CHF.',\n",

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Northwest American Indians are a drastically understudied and underserved group, at risk for multiple health problems, in particular, cardiovascular disease. American Indians living in the Northwest have very high rates of diabetes, obesity, tobacco use, and other risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. This application, in response to RFA HL-06-002, involves a 5-year developmental project to design and test a culturally appropriate, feasible, and generalizable cardiovascular disease risk prevention program for American Indians living in the Northwest. Building upon solid preliminary epidemiological and surveillance data as well as tribal support and an Indigenist stress-coping model, this study proposes five innovative and significant aims. First, we will conduct qualitative formative research involving 4 focus groups and 20, key informant interviews with parents aged 18-55 at risk for CVD, Native health providers, elder/traditional healers, and Native youth at long-term risk for CVD (aged 15-25). Second, we will conduct structured survey interviews with 375 American Indian adults randomly sampled from the Tulalip tribal rolls. With these interview data, we will test an indigenist stress coping model and establish preliminary baseline prevalence rates for self-reported CVD and its correlates with preliminary CVD and CVD risk-prevalence rates. Third, we will develop, manualize, and pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a culturally-based 4-month CVD prevention intervention targeting adult American Indian parents at risk for CVD. Fourth, we will conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) of a multi-level motivational CVD intervention with 240 at-risk parents or caregivers of children under the age of 18 to evaluate its efficacy. We will also measure BMI on 480 children (age 5-18) whose parents or caregivers are in the RCT. Fifth, we will translate and disseminate the findings to the tribe as well as research outlets and the scientific community and prepare translational materials for community consumption and implementation. Through the course of the study, we aim to develop the research infrastructure at Tulalip Indian health clinic and to build the research capacity of the tribal community.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Only decades ago cardiovascular disease (CVD) was rare in American Indians, but today it has become the leading cause of death for this population, exceeding rates in the general population. To reduce cardiovascular risk, we propose a holistic behavioral and lifestyle intervention program that is community-responsive and culturally appropriate. This intervention program will primarily focus on behavioral modification in diet and physical activity, which will lead to improvement of CVD risk factors and consequently reduction of CVD. The specific aims are:   [unreadable]   [unreadable] 1. To design and implement a culturally appropriate behavioral intervention program for American Indian adults (aged 30-59 years), who have high risk of developing CVD, to form healthy habits in diet and physical activity.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] 2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed behavioral intervention program using a two-arm randomized controlled design. Two hundred eligible American Indian men and women will be randomized into two groups: (1) \"intervention\" groups, which receives the proposed intervention program, and (2) \"control\" group, which receives conventional cardiovascular health information and advice only. Two sets of outcome measures will be used to compare the two groups. The primary outcome measures will be behavioral modification outcomes, including caloric intake, sodium intake and fruit and vegetable consumption for diet and pedometer measurements for physical activity. The secondary outcome measures are CVD risk factor measures, including weight (or BMI), total triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting glucose, blood pressure and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] 3. If successful, disseminate the intervention program to other American Indian tribes and communities for implementation.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] We hypothesize that participants in the intervention group will improve their caloric and sodium intake and increase fruit and vegetable consumption and physical activity when compared to the control group. The proposed intervention emphasizes achieving spiritual, mental, emotional and physical balance, which are elements of traditional American Indian wellness and vitality. The proposed intervention program is developed with much input from the Indian community and can be incorporated into tribal health programs. We believe it has a high probability of success and is highly sustainable in the community after the termination of this research study.   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Cardiovascular disease is the nation's leading cause of death, claiming a life every 33 seconds, 2600 lives each day, and nearly one million lives each year. For the majority of patients with any type of significantly advanced heart failure, the common, final clinical scenario is of a severely limited quality of life associated with a significant risk of death. The hypothesis behind the proposed projects is that stem cell therapy will benefit patients with varying degrees of heart failure. To date, the cummulative data from our studies and several others demonstrate that stem cell injections appear to be safe and possibly effective in at least some patients with heart failure. Our research consortium has conducted many studies (both pre-clinical and clinical) in this area of research and is currently enrolling patients in an FDA-approved Phase I clinical trial of transendocardial injections of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells for treatment of patients with advanced heart failure. In this application, we propose 2 potential protocols for the network. Protocol 1 allows us to continue our present trial with a Phase II trial that will also address an important question that remains unanswered: What is the ideal number of cells for transplant? (i.e.: Would 100,000,000 cells be more beneficial than the 30,000,000 we are currently using?) Protocol 2 focuses on the immediate postinfarct period and uses a specific type of stem cell, the Stro bright or mesenchymal precursor cell (MPC). All cells will be injected transendocardially and guided by electromechanical mapping into areas of viable myocardium. Safety of the cell delivery process will be assessed periprocedurely with Holter monitoring, and long-term safety will be assessed clinically for at least 3 years with imaging studies and catheter evaluations. Efficacy will be assessed primarily on the basis of imaging studies (echo, angio, MRI, SPECT, X-ray) and EKG, 24hr Holter monitoring, treadmill with MVO2, and lab work. We have now completed two pre-clinical studies using mesenchymal cell injections in canine models of chronic ischemia and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Both studies demonstrated that mesenchymal cells injected by the transendocardial route differentiated into smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, and resulted in increased vascularity and improved cardiac function. If proven safe and effective in FDA-approved clinical trials, these new therapies could extend the lives and improve the quality of life for almost 1 million people each year in the U.S. alone.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] The long-term objective of this application is to establish a University of Florida Clinical Center (UFCC) for the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN). Cardiovascular (CV) cell therapy is an exciting concept for replacement of noncontractile myocardium and its blood vessels. But despite abundant preclinical and feasibility clinical studies the ability to translate these findings to improve patient outcomes has lagged. To address this need, the UFCC utilizes established UF programs in Stem Cell Biology, Regenerative Medicine, Bone Marrow Transplant Clinical Center (part of the NIH clinical research network), novel imaging resources, the Heart Transplant Program and CV Clinical Trials Program. We have a long and well documented record of successful collaboration in multicenter NHLBI and other trials to test strategies to improve cardiac perfusion or function and evaluate clinical outcomes.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Our center proposes that enhancing progenitor cell function will improve cardiac function in CAD patients with heart failure and ultimately lead to improved clinical outcomes. The two UFCC protocols propose to develop cell therapy for CAD patients with left ventricular dysfunction/heart failure using direct intramural implantation by percutaneous catheter. The first of these addresses enhancing progenitor cell function in diabetic patients. The hypothesis is in that improving NO bioavailability within the CD34+ cells will enhance their inherent ability to improve myocardial function. Specific aims test whether increasing CD34+ cell numbers; endogenous NO administration to CD34+ cells; and incubating CD34+ cells under croyperserved and/or hypoxic conditions improves wall motion or perfusion abnormalities. The hypothesis in the second protocol is that patients awaiting cardiac transplantation provide a unique opportunity to investigate effects of cell therapy on function. Specific aims test whether skeletal myoblasts' (SkM) effect on ventricular function will be dependent on the presence of cells and not a reaction to the implantation process. We will determine whether there are greater numbers of surviving cells among patients treated and redosed at 3 months and will measure the effects of cell therapy using SkM co-administered with CD34+ cells optimized in Protocol 1.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Since these studies will be performed in patients awaiting transplantation, studies of explanted hearts and labeled cells should yield new information on the fate and specific location of cell implants. Novel features of both protocols are that the cells will be labeled and tracked noninvasively and verified histologically in terms of cell type in the explanted hearts investigated in Protocol 2. Other unique aspects of the UFCC include the Training Core utilizing the structure available through our K30 and T32 programs in related areas and collaborations with the University of Puerto Rico and industry. This work will improve our understanding of the role of cell therapy in patients with CAD and heart failure.  (End of Abstract)  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",

This project will 1) test the effectiveness of a mentored home-visiting and group support intervention to improve nutrition and physical activity levels in Al preschoolers and their primary caregivers vs. intervention materials alone, 2) involve each community in detailed assessments of the macro-level community environmental supports and barriers to families for achieving healthy diets and adequate levels of physical activity, and 3) incorporate participatory research throughout all stages of the project to develop additional data-driven, culturally acceptable community based interventions to support healthy behavior changes in families and increase community research capacity. Aim 1, Healthy Children Strong Families (HCSF), is a 2 year randomized controlled trial composed of one year of targeted home visits during which trained Al mentors will work with 3-5 year old Al children and their primary caregivers to promote skill-based behavior change. During year 2, intervention families will attend monthly group meetings with activities to sustain changes made in year 1. Control families will receive intervention materials and newsletters only. 75 Al families will comprise each of the two arms of the study. Primary outcomes are decreased child waist circumference and decreased caregiver body mass index. Secondary outcomes include: increased fruit/vegetable consumption, decreased TV viewing, increased physical activity, decreased soda/sweetened drink consumption, improved caregiver biochemical indices, and increased caregiver self-efficacy to adopt healthy behaviors. Aim 2, Supportive Communities, utilizes community advisory boards to design and prioritize assessments of food, recreation, economic, legal, and other systems in their communities.

MnCTN will consist of the consortium of four Minneapolis cutting-edge cardiovascular institutions and the Minnesota Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics (part of the NHLBI-sponsored Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies (PACT) group). The MnCTN is critically important to the mission of the NIH, and the institutions in this application, all of which aim to improve patients' health and save lives, as it provides a unique opportunity to translate basic science of cell therapies into clinical research evaluating the potential of cell therapies as an alternative strategy to halt cardiovascular disease progression and improve patients' outcomes. The institutions of MnCTN have nationally recognized expertise with large clinical patient populations that have unmet treatment need and a high likelihood of benefit from cellular therapy (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, refractory angina, and end-stage heart failure, including patients with left ventricular assist devices). We have an outstanding track record of high enrollment and high quality data in multicenter trials in these areas, including 11 recently completed and/or ongoing cardiovascular cellular therapy clinical trials. Our extensive experience has built expertise in trial design, patient selection, delivery techniques, and endpoint measurements including state-of-the-art imaging and surrogate endpoints. We have the distinct advantage of being one of three PACT institutions, which promotes establishment of standards and application of good manufacturing and clinical practices to the research process. With the infrastructure under this RFA, our expertise will greatly enhance the success of cell therapy protocols at other sites selected to carry out clinical trials. The clinical application of cellular therapies is built on a longstanding success of basic science at the UMN Center for Cardiovascular Repair and the Stem Cell Institute. Such approach, under the structure of this RFA, will generate scientific knowledge and address clinically relevant questions on mechanisms of cell therapies and effects on cardiovascular disease. Using the clinical sites and resources under this RFA, we will establish a bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell repository, which will be used to identify and characterize the best suitable cells, as well as the future responders to therapy. We believe we are perfectly suited to play an important role in the NHLBI cardiovascular cell therapy research network, capitalizing on our basic research skills, abilities to conduct multi-center clinical trials within an integrative network, and to disseminate knowledge.

       " 'Heart Failure is the most common reason for admission to hospitals in the United States, especially in the Medicare population. A majority of patients with HF have poor left ventricular function, with 60-70% due to chronic ischemic coronary disease. The remainder of patients experience HF due to a variety of other causes, including idiopathic and viral cardiomyopathies, and are classified as dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. Stem cells (endothelial, mesenchymal, skeletal or from bone marrow), injected directly into the myocardium or delivered to the coronary circulation, can improve cardiac function in chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy or following an acute myocardial infarction. While there is evidence that cell therapy can improve cardiac function, the exact mechanisms through which cell therapy exerts beneficial effects remain unclear. We and others have demonstrated that the cardioprotective effects of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) following myocardial infarction are mediated, in part, by multiple cytokines secreted by stem cells, which can favorably enhance myocardial survival. We postulate that an enriched, mixed, stem cell population may offer an advantage over a single cell type. It is also evident from our studies that active interaction between stem cells and the vascular wall during systemic delivery is necessary for efficient grafting to occur. This proposal describes two clinical protocols to use bone marrow-derived cells for the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction. The first will test the hypothesis that expansion of bone marrow cells to yield high levels of endothelial and mesenchymal progenitor cells will produce a greater improvement in cardiac function compared to freshly harvested bone marrow cells. The second will investigate the role of cell therapy in dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and test the hypothesis that adenosine pretreatment will enhance cell homing potentiating the beneficial effects of cell therapy. To foster future research, a Clinical Research Skills Development Core will train new clinical investigators in cardiac cell-therapy. The two clinical protocols will determine the efficacy of different cell preparations and the role of modulating stem cell engraftment in target tissue to restore ventricular function opening the way for feasible, easily applied strategies to capture the healing properties of bone marrow-derived cells.',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in American Indians (Als). While the presence of type 2 diabetes, with its many behavioral antecedents, constitutes a significant portion of the CVD risk in this population, there have been few behaviorally-based interventions among American Indians intended to lessen this CVD risk. Poor dietary and physical activity habits and adherence with prescribed therapies and instructions for chronic disease management are several important behaviors that can place an individual at increased risk of CVD and, in turn, possibly be amenable to a cognitive intervention. Innovations in home-based care are emerging to create a new paradigm for chronic disease management. The Institute of Medicine\\'s report, \"Crossing the Quality Chasm,\" has recommended a shift from care based primarily on sporadic office visits toward \"care based on continuous healing relationships ... not just face-to-face visits\". We feel it warranted to test some of these new home-based, cognitive strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention among American Indians. Therefore, the Specific Aims of this project are to:   [unreadable]   [unreadable] 1. Implement a Social Cognitive Theory-, home-based, remote care approach to improve the adherence of a cohort of American Indians, free of but at high risk for CVD, with prescribed physiologic therapies and behavioral instructions they have been given to manage, respectively, their diagnosed hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes;   [unreadable] 2. Improve the adherence of these cohort members with behavioral lifestyle antecedents such as diet, exercise, and smoking, that impact the physiologic conditions described in Aim #1 and, hence, CVD risk;   [unreadable] 3. Provide these American Indian study participants with a culturally-tailored, home health-based chronic disease management program, coupled with the requisite hardware, software, training and staffing, that will supplement in a paradigm-changing way the route in which they presently receive care; and   [unreadable] 4. Document the cost-effectiveness of this intervention by documenting all program costs per patient served; the cost per change in specified outcome measures if the program is found to be effective; and a comparison of the intervention costs to those of other comparable programs and strategies employed within the IHS to improve diabetes self-management and prevent the onset of CVD.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] We believe there are few issues in healthcare as rapidly emerging as chronic disease management and the role that home-based care might play, including cardiovascular disease prevention. By the year 2030, fully half of the US adult population will be both chronically diseased and wired. The epidemiology of American Indian health has already transitioned from a model of infectious disease to one of chronic disease. This unique intervention, if proven effective, will serve as a model for home-based care and cardiovascular disease prevention in many other rural settings, both Indian and non-Indian.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Diabetes, and the complications of diabetes, are the result of complex genetic and environmental interactions. In the present cycle of the AMDCC, we have sought to identify realistic animal models of the complications of diabetes by characterizing naturally occurring variations among inbred strains of mice that impact diabetes, insulin resistance and athersclerosis. Among the most promising models is the classic BKS.db mouse. BKS.db consists of a combination of alleles derived from inbred strain DBA on the background of strain C57BL/6, along with a null mutation of the leptin recepter gene db. During the present AMDCC cycle we identified all of the regions of BKS that are derived from DBA using very high density SNP mapping. These regions are scattered throughout the genome, and it is clear that multiple DBA alleles are required for the development of diabetes and its complications. We then identified two strong candidates for the DBA alleles required for diabetes: 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) and lipin, both of which are dramatically reduced in activity in BKS as compared to C57BL/6. In this application we will extend the investigations of 5LO, lipin and other genes predisposing to diabetes and its complications in BKS.db. We will also introduce the apolipoprotein E (Apo E) null mutation onto BKS to produce a model for diabetes - induced athersclerosis. To facilitate the genetic dissection of this model we have produced a whole genome set of congenic strains in which regions of DBA have been introgressed on the background of C57BL/6. Our analyses will incorporate state of the art physiologic and bioinformatic approaches and will integrate an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) database that we have developed over the past several years.

Specifically, we have found that streptozotocin-treated mice develop increased atherosclerosis in the presence of a transgene for human aldose reductase (hAR). We have also noted that hearts from these mice have areas of cardiac apoptosis. In addition, we have developed novel methods to study atherosclerosis regression that can be applied to studies of lesions in control and diabetic mice.  [unreadable] Aim 1 To create new mouse models of diabetic cardiovascular disease: We propose to create two new genetically altered mice. Aim 1a is to use the tet on system to allow expression of hAR in a time dependent manner. This system will allow us to test whether hAR expression in established lesions alters plaque morphology. These animals can also be used to produce tissue specific expression of hAR. Aim 1b is to produce mice with expression of hAR in cardiomyocytes. These mice, we hypothesize, will develop cardiomyopathy with diabetes.  [unreadable] Aim 2 To study the development of vascular lesions in diabetic mice: Mild diabetes due to deficiency of Pdx1 or high fat diets did not alter atherosclerosis in Ldlr-/- mice. In addition, Pdx1 did not affect regression after transplant of arteries containing atherosclerosis. We will use two additional methods to generate hyperglycemia, Akita and high fat diets on the FVB background, in Ldlr-/- mice [unreadable] hAR. Increased vascular disease in STZ-treated hAR mice could result from greater monocyte/macrophage accumulation in lesions, or could be secondary to a defect in lesion regression. Both processes will be studied in vivo and mechanistic information obtained by studying gene and protein expression.    [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] While diabetes mellitus can lead to serious damage to many organs, cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of death and morbidity in diabetic patients. Overall, patients with diabetes have a three to five fold increased risk of coronary artery diseases compared to non-diabetics. Our goal is to use mouse genetics for identifying genetic risk factors for the vascular complications of diabetes and for unraveling underlying mechanisms. Although a significant increase in atherosclerosis by diabetes has been demonstrated in atherogenic mouse models, none of these mouse models faithfully replicates the types of dyslipidemia associated with diabetes in humans. We postulate that this failure is due to differences in the relative levels of plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) and plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) that are controlled by genetic differences between the two species and genetic polymorphisms in humans. Thus our first hypothesis is that humanizing genes that are involved in lipoprotein metabolism in mice so that they develop a more human-like diabetic dyslipidemia will cause them to replicate better the cardiovascular problems of human diabetic patients. We will test this hypothesis in Specific Aim 1 by inducing diabetes in mice with humanized apoE of the three isoforms (E2, E3, and E4) and humanized LDL receptor (LDLR), with or without overexpression of human apoB. We predict that this will lead to diabetic dyslipidemia and accelerated atherosclerosis in an apoE isoform dependent manner. Our second hypothesis is that since diabetes is generally acknowledged to induce oxidative stress, genetically determined differences in the levels of endogenous anti-oxidants affect the development of cardiovascular complications,. To test this hypothesis, we propose in Specific Aim 2 to develop a new mouse model with a genetically controlled reduction in the production of the endogenous antioxidant lipoic acid (LA). We will modify the LA synthase (Lias) gene in such a way that the stability of Lias mRNA will be drastically reduced in a tissue specific fashion. Our hypothesis predicts that reduced production of LA will increase the oxidative stress already present in diabetic mice and enhance their development of vascular complications. In Specific Aim 3, we propose to combine human-like diabetic dyslipidemia with genetically reduced antioxidant capacity due to LA deficiency to test our overall thesis that interactions between genetic polymorphic differences affecting lipid profiles and genetic differences affecting endogenous antioxidant levels determine the degree to which diabetes enhances cardiovascular disease.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] This proposal is submitted to become a pathobiology site in the renewal of the Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium (AMDCC). The University of Utah site proposes to generate two mouse models. The first will address mechanisms that are responsible for diabetic cardiomyopathy, and the second will model the role of impaired angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in the pathogenesis of ischemic complications of diabetes. Our studies in the first phase of the consortium revealed that diabetic cardiomyopathy (particularly in type 2 diabetes) was characterized by impaired myocardial insulin action, mitochondria! dysfunction, oxidative stress, increased FA utilization, decreased glucose utilization and lipotoxicity. Mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of insulin receptors (CIRKO), developed many of the features of diabetic cardiomyopathy but did not have a persistent increase in FA oxidation, did not develop lipotoxicity and had modest defects in cardiac function. We therefore propose to introduce into CIRKO mice an Acyl-CoA synthetase transgene that will modestly increased myocardial FA delivery in a sensitized background of mitochondrial superoxide (Sod2) haploinsufficency. We will then determine if these mice meet established AMDCC criteria for diabetic cardiomyopathy, determine if they exhibit characteristic defects in mitochondrial function and substrate utilization and test the hypothesis that they will be more susceptible to dysfunction in the face of LV hypertrophy.This model represents a powerful platform with which to test the direct effect of various therapeutic strategies on diabetic cardiomyopathy, independently of effects on systemic metabolism. We will also generate a mouse in the type -1 diabetes (Akita) background with temporal and cell-type restricted expression of a novel angiogenic factor netrin 1. We will use this mouse to determine if the maintenance of arteriogenesis and angiogenesis, by activating this transgene in the heart or the hind-limb will be sufficient to ameliorate the accelerated LV remodeling that characterizes diabetic hearts following coronary artery ligation, or reverse impaired recovery of hind-limb perfusion that occurs in diabetic animals following femoral artery occlusion. This model will also be a powerful platform with which to evaluate the role of impaired angiogenesis (in the pathogenesis), or therapeutic angiogenesis (in the treatment) of other ischemic complications of diabetes such as impaired wound healing, neuropathy or nephropathy.

       " '  [unreadable] Description (provided by applicant): Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS) develops frequently (25-50%) in patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) despite the use of standard anticoagulant therapy. PTS leads to lifestyle-limiting symptoms, work disability, leg ulcers, quality of life (QOL) impairment, and major healthcare costs. Preliminary studies indicate that image-guided Endovascular Thrombus Removal procedures can rapidly restore deep venous patency and thereby prevent PTS in acute proximal DVT patients. However, these studies are limited by reliance upon surrogate anatomic outcome measures of limited clinical significance, non-randomized design, single-center design, and small sample size. For this reason, there currently exists major controversy within the medical community as to whether or not Endovascular Thrombus Removal should be routinely used in the first-line treatment of acute proximal DVT. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to determine whether Endovascular Thrombus Removal should be translated into widespread, first-line use in patients with acute DVT. In the proposed study, we will conduct a Phase III, multicenter, open label, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial entitled \"Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal With Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis (ATTRACT)\" to determine whether the use of Pharmacomechanical Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis (PCDT), a state-of-the-art Endovascular Thrombus Removal method, results in a) a lower prevalence of PTS and b) superior quality of life (QOL), two clinically important treatment outcomes, in symptomatic, first episode, acute proximal DVT patients. The proposed research is both innovative and significant. The study will be the first multicenter randomized trial to evaluate a state-of-the-art image-guided endovascular strategy for the prevention of PTS. If the study establishes a favorable risk-benefit ratio for PCDT, this finding will fundamentally change clinical practice and enable prevention of PTS in thousands of DVT patients. If PCDT does not prevent PTS or if its risk-benefit ratio proves to be unfavorable, this finding will reduce or eliminate the routine use of a costly and potentially risky therapy. Hence, either outcome of the proposed study will greatly improve clinical practice and decrease morbidity in patients with acute DVT, a common blood disorder. Therefore, the study will clearly improve public health and advance the NHLBI\\'s mission.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Project Narrative: The ATTRACT Trial will determine whether Pharmacomechanical Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis can prevent the Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS) in patients with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). If the Trial is positive, this finding will conclusively validate the \"Open Vein Hypothesis\" and thereby a) immediately enable prevention of PTS, a common, morbid, and expensive condition, in thousands of DVT patients each year; and b) catalyze a fundamental shift towards a new treatment paradigm in which early venous thrombus removal is considered an essential element of initial DVT therapy. If the Trial is negative, this finding will eliminate the routine use of a costly and potentially dangerous therapy. Hence, either study outcome will decrease morbidity from DVT, improve public health, and advance the NHLBI\\'s mission.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

The goal is to discover genes for response using both candidate gene and genomic approaches in the context of family designs. Large numbers of families of multiple ethnicities and wide geographical dispersion were collected, phenotyped before and after intervention. Selected candidate genes were examined and genome-wide linkage panels are being completed. This renewal period is devoted to analysis and follow-up genotyping. Although the interventions and primary outcomes differ from study to study, the PROGENI network component studies have important key aspects in common, most importantly, the need for efficient statistical analysis methods for gene finding for intervention response phenotypes. The PROGENI Data Coordinating Center provides both administrative and scientific support to the entire network, including study website, data pooling, quality control, Analysis Workshops, and development and evaluation of novel statistical methods of analysis for all studies.

Together with our consortium institutions, Inova Fairfax Hospital and Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, our team performs an average of 3,000 adult cardiovascular surgical procedures annually (> 800 cases at UVA alone) which would be available for recruitment in Network protocols. The investigative group is led by Dr. Irving L. Kron, a cardiothoracic and vascular surgeon who is Chair of the Department of Surgery at UVA. He has been involved in multiple national leadership roles that relate to cardiothoracic research and education. He also has received long term research funding from NHLBI. The co-principal investigator is Dr. Karen C. Johnston, a nationally recognized vascular certified neurologist with NINDS funding and expertise in clinical trials, neuroprotection and outcomes research. Additionally, Dr. John Dent, a nationally known cardiologist, provides specific expertise in echocardiography as it applies to valvular heart disease. The unique mix of cardiovascular surgery, stroke neurology/neurological outcomes, and cardiology in addition to a large urban and rural population base guarantees that UVA will make substantive and novel contributions to the Network for Cardiothoracic Surgical Investigations in Cardiovascular Medicine.

We propose two Model Protocols as examples of important questions in Cardiothoracic surgery that impact large adult populations, can be evaluated through small, short-term clinical studies and require the implementation of the Network to answer. Specifically, we hypothesize that patients with persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) and left atrial enlargement will have significantly greater freedom from AF 12 months after minimally invasive surgical ablation than after catheter ablation, measured by an autocapture continuous event monitor. In the second Model Protocol, we hypothesize that in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and moderate (2+-3+) ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR), the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) 30 days after isolated CABG will be lower than after combined CABG with mitral valve surgery, and that the incidence of MACE 2 years after isolated CABG will not be higher than after combined CABG with mitral valve surgery. Each protocol incorporates a prospective, randomized controlled trial design and suggests numerous correlative science sub-studies. The Emory University Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery ranks in the top 1% of the nation for volume of open heart surgery performed annually and has the patient population, clinical research experience, infrastructure and enthusiastic collaborators in allied specialties to enroll large numbers of patients simultaneously into multiple clinical protocols within the proposed Network. We are committed to evidence-based practice in Cardiothoracic surgery and if chosen to become a Clinical Center, will adhere to all guidelines and regulations of the Network, including sharing of data and timely dissemination of findings to ensure that the public has access to the best procedures in Cardiothoracic surgery, determined by careful assessment.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Congestive heart failure (CHF) represents an enormous healthcare and economic burden worldwide. Strategies to relieve this burden include refining current therapies to treat specific cardiac lesions. Optimal therapy (medical or surgical) for mitral regurgitation (MR) in the patient with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) remains unclear. Indeed, the only data available comes from single-center, non-randomized, noncomparative trials with small numbers of patients and suggests that these patients may benefit from correction of functional mitral regurgitation. Specific Aim #1 of Project 1 is to determine whether mitral valve repair (MVr) results in improved exercise capacity compared to optimal medical management (OMM) in patients with moderate to severe MR and low LVEF. Specific Aim #2 of Project 1 is to determine whether MVr results in improved quality of life (QOL) compared to OMM in patients with moderate to severe MR and low LVEF. Eligible patients will be randomized to OMM or OMM + MVr. Follow up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months for the first year and at 6 month intervals thereafter, will evaluate endpoints. A second clinical trial will evaluate the appropriateness of current clinical practice which maintains that coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) alone is sufficient to treat patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and mild to moderate chronic ischemic MR. Recent clinical reports indicate a worse prognosis for low LVEF patients treated with CABG alone and is coincident with the development of worsening MR requiring aggressive medical management and even surgical intervention. Project 2 addresses the surgical management of mild to moderate chronic ischemic MR in patients with CAD and any LVEF. Importantly, patients with organic disease of the mitral valve such as mitral valve prolapse, ruptured chordae and endocarditis will be excluded from the study. Specific Aim #1 of Project 2 is to determine whether MVr + CABG results in improved survival free of cardiac events compared to CABG alone in patients with mild to moderate chronic ischemic MR, any LVEF, and coronary artery disease requiring revascularization. Specific Aim #2 of Project 2 is to determine whether MVr + CABG results in improved survival free of persistent or progressive MR compared to CABG alone in patients with mild to moderate chromic ischemic MR, any LVEF, and coronary artery disease requiring revascularization. Eligible patients will be randomized to OMM + CABG alone or OMM + CABG + MVr. Follow up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months for the first year and at 6 month intervals thereafter, will evaluate endpoints. A Clinical Research Skills Development Core submission will accompany this proposal.   [unreadable]   [unreadable] (End of Abstract)  [unreadable]   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] This is a defining moment in the 50-year history of cardiac surgery. For 30+ years, the specialty has been dominated by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Percutaneous coronary intervention has largely replaced CABG as the initial treatment of coronary artery disease, making cardiac surgery a treatment of last resort for patients with complex heart disease. In redefining itself, an atmosphere of innovation abounds, but secure evidence for clinical application of new therapies lags behind enthusiasm. A Network of high-volume Clinical Centers, poised to perform proof-of-concept clinical trials and establish registries, is needed now as never before. Cleveland Clinic, America's highest-volume, highest-ranked cardiovascular surgery program, with the largest clinical research group, possesses the desire, capacity, capability, and track record to participate fully in this Network as a Clinical Center and Clinical Research Skills Development Core. We propose 2 randomized trials of new therapy. One represents the first of several needed steps in testing surgical ablation of permanent atrial fibrillation accompanying structural heart disease in need of surgical intervention. It will test the hypothesis that a more extensive, biatrial lesion set more effectively prevents recurrent atrial fibrillation than simple pulmonary vein isolation. The second tests the hypothesis that newly emerging endovascular exclusion of chronic distal aortic dissection that has undergone aneurysmal degeneration is safer than open surgery. We also propose a clinical research skills development core built on our existing successful Roadmap K12 multidisciplinary scholars program, targeting 1 full-time cardiovascular surgeon-scholar per year for a 2- year education and mentored research fellowship. Lay Summary: The specialty of cardiac surgery needs redirection, with innovation coupled with rigorous multicenter testing of new therapies to be certain of their value. We present 2 randomized trials: 1 tests new treatments for a common heart rhythm disturbance that causes strokes and death, and the other tests a new, less invasive therapy for a disease of the aorta that unexpectedly causes people to bleed to death. We also propose to educate and mentor new surgeon-investigators to take a leadership role in devising ways to build an evidence basis for use of innovative therapies in patients with life-threatening heart disease.

This proposal consists of two separate prospective randomized studies: 1) \"Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Mitral Valve Repair for Functional Mitral Insufficiency and Ventricular Dysfunction\" (Dr. Joseph Woo, Co-investigator) and 2) \"Adjunct Delivery of Aortic Stent Graft in the Descending Thoracic Aorta in Acute Type A Dissection Repair Obliterates the Residual False Lumen and Prevents Aneurysmal Remodeling of the Distal Thoracoabdominal Aorta\" (Dr. Joseph Bavaria, Coinvestigator). Each of the proposed studies addresses an important manifestation of adverse cardiovascular remodeling which currently confront cardiologists and cardiac surgeons on a routine basis. Both studies will be done in a multi-disciplinary fashion with full collaborative support from the Divisions of Cardiovascular Surgery, Cardiology, Vascular Surgery and Cardiac Anesthesiology. The principal investigator, as well as his co-investigators, has a long track record of clinical research in the fields of heart failure and aortic surgery. Each year the Division of Cardiovascular Surgery at the University of Pennsylvania performs over 1800 major procedures at three completely integrated hospitals. For the past three years we have performed 2621 valve operations and 963 thoracic aortic operations. In that same time period 1121 patients with New York Heart Association Class II, III or IV heart failure and/or an ejection fraction of<40% have had mitral valve surgery. Also in that time, 119 patients have had emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissections. This clinical volume is more than enough for our proposed projects (MR with LV dysfunction and aortic dissection) and would represent a robust source of complex patients for any potential network study. In addition there is a research skills core that will include practical experience and didactic learning opportunities for junior faculty interested in expanding their knowledge of clinical trials and for surgical residents intending to develop primary research expertise in clinical trials. Participants in the skills core will have the opportunity to work on Network clinical trials as well as on other clinical trials within the Division of Cardiovascular Surgery.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Despite improvements in cardiac surgery and anesthesia in the face of sicker and elderly patients, numerous ssues remain to be clarified concerning the best treatment options for ischemic mitral valve regurgitation and novel therapy for pulmonary hypertension. These important questions are difficult to answer with single center trials even in centers with a high volume of complex valvular surgery. The NIH has decided to form a network of clinical centers to address this challenge. The U of Montreal Cardiac Surgery Clinical Investigation Group (UMCSCIG) is proposing to join the NIH Network to help attain its goals of bringing innovative experimental strategies for the treatment of cardiac surgical pathology from the laboratory to the bedside. The U of M investigation Group is made up of 3 tertiary university hospital centers on 5 sites in the city of Montreal, treating over 3000 patients by 17 surgeons which represents close to 50% of the cardiac surgical volume of the Province of Quebec (population 8 million). The Group has a number of special attributes, and brings with it expertise that would be helpful for the NIH network as a whole. Its members belong to a single payer socialized medicine system, which facilitates patient follow-up and data generation. The close collaboration of cardiac surgical investigators with extensive experience in clinical trials with cardiologists, clinician-scientists and basic researchers within the research centers of the 3 hospital centers by their affiliation to the University of Montreal plus the hook-up with the Canadian East-West Network and the Quebec Heart Failure Society dedicated to Heart Failure Research are definite advantages. The MHI has a long and successful tradition of working with the NIH, it has an experienced clinical research co-ordinating center. The group has access to state of the art investigative technology, expertise in blood sampling, transportation and performs a large spectrum of open and minimally invasive coronary, valvular and aortic surgery as well as heart transplantation and implantable artificial heart program and emerging strength in cell therapy and seven new hybrid technology operating rooms are currently under construction at MHI. The U of Montreal Research Group proposes a project to evaluate the effect of a new treatment option for severe ischemic mitral regurgitation and a second project test a new pharmacological management of pulmonary hypertension in patients experiencing difficult separation from cardiopulmonary bypass.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the high rate of sudden death in the first 2 months following a myocardial infarction (Ml), current guidelines for implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) recommend delayed implantation (>40 days) after an Ml in patients with low ejection fraction (EF). Delaying implantation leaves an unprotected window of increased sudden death risk prior to ICD implantation. In addition, only left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) is used to decide whether a post-Mi patient should subsequently receive an ICD for primary prevention of sudden death. In this setting, only 20% of patients will have spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias requiring ICD shocks in the next 5 years. A more cost-effective method for selecting patients for primary prevention ICD implantation is needed. To address these two deficiencies, we propose the Vest prevention of Early Sudden death Trial (VEST) and the PREDiction of ICd Therapies Study (PREDICTS). This proposal seeks funding for a Clinical Coordinating Center, the linked R01 (PI Hulley) is for a Data Coordinating Center, and the remaining funding (80%) will come from industry. VEST is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to determine whether a non-invasive wearable defibrillator vest will reduce overall mortality during the first 60 days following an Ml in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (EF<35%). PREDICTS is a follow-up to this randomized intervention, in which participants in VEST will undergo a battery of risk stratification tests including T wave alternans, baroreflex sensitivity, Holter monitoring and 7 other likely predictors before placement of an ICD. Participants will then be monitored for ICD shocks and other clinical outcomes over the next 5 years. These data will be used to develop and validate a multivariable risk stratification tool that predicts the occurrence of \"shockable\" ventricular arrhythmias and efficiently identifies high-risk patients in whom an ICD would be most cost-effective (and low-risk patients in whom an ICD is not necessary). Biological samples and data from both studies will be stored and made available to outside investigators for future studies. We anticipate that VEST and PREDICTS will have a major impact on the 500,000 annual sudden deaths in the US by testing an intervention that may protect the very highest-risk early post-Mi patients, and by identifying a risk stratification strategy to identify those at highest and lowest risk and make ICD implantation more cost-effective.

This proposal will establish a racially diverse cohort that is sufficiently large and appropriately designed for genome-wide association analysis of COPD. A total of 10,500 subjects will be recruited, including control smokers and subjects across the full range of COPD severity (GOLD Stages 1 through 4). This cohort will be used for cross-sectional analysis, although long-term longitudinal follow-up will be a future goal. The primary focus of the study will be genome-wide association analysis to identify the genetic risk factors that determine susceptibility for COPD and COPD related[unreadable] phenotypes. Detailed phenotyping of COPD cases, including chest CT scan assessment of emphysema and airway disease, will allow identification of genetic determinants for the heterogeneous components of the COPD syndrome. The hypotheses to be studied are: 1) Precise phenotypic characterization of COPD subjects using computed tomography, as well as clinical and physiological measures, will provide data that will enable the broad COPD syndrome to be decomposed into[unreadable] clinically significant subtypes. 2) Genome-wide association studies will identify genetic determinants for COPD susceptibility that will provide insight into clinically relevant COPD subtypes. 3) Distinct genetic determinants influence the development of emphysema and airway disease. The genome-wide association analysis will involve four phases to identify COPD susceptibility genes using a case-control design. The Specific Aims are (1) Cohort Building. Identify and phenotype COPD case and control cohorts in two racial groups (non-Hispanic whites and African Americans) for genetic and natural history studies. (2) Genome-wide Association Study. In Phase 1, a genome-wide panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will be tested for association with COPD and COPD-related phenotypes in COPD case-control samples within each racial group. In Phase 2, the top-ranked 6,000 SNPs in each racial group will be validated and tested in a second round of association analysis in independent samples. In Phase 3, the genomic regions around the top-ranked[unreadable] 50 SNPs in each racial group will be analyzed to identify genes/regions yielding confirmed association signals. In Phase 4, final susceptibility gene identification will be performed in the entire study population, with external validation in the Boston Early-Onset COPD Study and International COPD Genetics Network. (3) Epidemiologic[unreadable] characterization of subtypes of COPD using the radiologic, physiologic, and clinical data including CT emphysema and airway phenotypes, degree of functional impairment, and severity of COPD, will be performed. Finally, SNPs in the identified COPD genes from Aim 2 will be tested for association with these COPD subtypes.[unreadable] ',\n",

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months. Validity relative to self report, acceptability, and longitudinal compliance will be measured.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns. Objectives are to fuse existing voice and image recognition techniques into a system that will recognize foods by food type and unique characteristics and determine volume by film clip showing an image from at least two angles. The item identified will be matched to an appropriate food item and amount within a food composition database and nutrient intake computed. Researchers will be able to view the resulting analysis through an adapted version of the dietary analysis program, ProNutra. The proposed protocol will incorporate three discrete phases: 1) technology development, integration, and testing; 2) validity testing with a controlled diet (metabolic ward study); and 3) real-world utility testing. Validity of the data collected will be judged by how closely the nutrient calculations match the known composition of the metabolic ward diets consumed. FIVR has the potential to establish a method of highly accurate dietary intake assessment suitable for cost-effective use at the population level, and thereby advance crucial public health objectives.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] The primary cause of illness and death in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is progressive lung disease. CF is caused by a mutation in a chloride channel gene. Defective clearance of airway mucus related to the underlying chloride channel abnormality predisposes patients with CF to chronic airway infection and inflammation which in turn causes progressive airway damage. It is now well established that CF lung disease begins in infancy, frequently prior to the onset of symptoms, providing a rationale for early intervention. Inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) has been shown in short-term studies to improve mucociliary clearance and in long term studies to improve lung function, decrease the rate of pulmonary exacerbations and improve quality of life in CF patients over 6 years of age. There are no efficacy data in younger CF patients. HS is a particularly attractive agent to study in infants because it improves defective mucociliary clearance, an early step in the cascade of events leading to CF lung disease that is expected to be abnormal prior to the onset of airway infection and inflammation. This proposal is for a randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of 7% HS inhaled twice daily for 48 weeks among infants with CF 4 to 15 months of age at enrollment. Our primary hypothesis is that, compared to the control agent (isotonic saline), HS will improve hyperinflation and obstructive lung disease as measured by infant lung function testing. The efficacy and safety results generated by the proposed trial may for the first time provide evidence for early initiation of a therapy used widely in older CF patients, thereby potentially delaying or preventing devastating airway damage before it becomes irreversible. One hundred and fifty infants ages 4 to 15 months will be enrolled at 16 centers. Study visits will take place at enrollment and weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48, generally in conjunction with routine CF clinic visits. Subjects will undergo lung function testing at enrollment, 24 and 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is the change in the functional residual capacity, a measure of hyperinflation, from baseline to end of treatment. Additional lung function measures will also be assessed. The secondary endpoint is the time to first pulmonary exacerbation requiring antibiotic therapy. Other clinical endpoints will include changes in weight and height, resting respiratory rate and oximetry, a standardized cough score, and symptoms by parental home report. Safety will be assessed by evaluation of rates of adverse events, withdrawal, adherence to treatment, new isolation of CF pathogens from respiratory cultures; and clinical parameters measured at study visits during the 48-week treatment period. This Clinical Coordinating Center application is submitted in conjunction with a Data Coordinating Center application. This is the lead application. The public health impact of this study could be significant, as it may provide the first efficacy and long term safety data on hypertonic saline in infants with CF, potentially allowing the use of this promising agent in the youngest CF patients. HS is a particularly attractive agent to study in infants because it improves defective mucociliary clearance, an early step in the cascade of events leading to CF lung disease that is expected to be abnormal prior to the onset of airway infection and inflammation. This would be the first multicenter clinical trial of a pulmonary maintenance therapy specifically in infants with CF, and the first to use measures of infant lung function as an endpoint.

Safety will be assessed by evaluation of rates of adverse events, withdrawal, adherence to treatment, new isolation of CF pathogens from respiratory cultures; and clinical parameters measured at study visits during the 48-week treatment period. This Clinical Coordinating Center application is submitted in conjunction with a Data Coordinating Center application. This is the lead application. The public health impact of this study could be significant, as it may provide the first efficacy and long term safety data on hypertonic saline in infants with CF, potentially allowing the use of this promising agent in the youngest CF patients. HS is a particularly attractive agent to study in infants because it improves defective mucociliary clearance, an early step in the cascade of events leading to CF lung disease that is expected to be abnormal prior to the onset of airway infection and inflammation. This would be the first multicenter clinical trial of a pulmonary maintenance therapy specifically in infants with CF, and the first to use measures of infant lung function as an endpoint.

       " \"Understanding the total health burden of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD), and the impact of vaccine policies on health care provision is critical to developing vaccine strategies. Our Rochester New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) site (a founding NVSN member), has demonstrated a large inpatient burden of VPD using population-based studies with molecular viral diagnosis. We propose to enhance our NSVN by measuring and comparing the total burden of VPDs in hospital, Emergency Department (ED), & outpatient care settings, and by studying the healthcare impact of current & new vaccine policies. Seven projects in 4 major areas are proposed, to determine the: A.) population-based burden in children ages 0<5y of acute respiratory infection from influenza (A,B), RSV (A,B), parainfluenza viruses (1,2,3), & human metapneumo- virus in the area's only 2 pediatric hospitals (300 samples/y), corresponding 2 EDs (300 sampies/y), & 6 outpatient sites (400samples/y); B.) changes in healthcare from the introduction of new vaccines/policies on both vaccine practices/vaccine coverage for influenza & pneumococcal (PCV7) vaccines and on community disease burden (e.g. otitis media after PCV7) (by performing 4000 chart reviews in 60 practices [>85% of the population of 2-5y-olds], and by analyzing a local insurance dataset [n=140,000, >70% of population] and national datasets); C.) influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing hospital, ED, & outpatient visits (case- cohort studies-cases from all 3 healthcare settings, controls from community, and strata of all children ages 6-23m & high risk children ages 2-5y); D.) potential burden of rotavirus disease to prepare for population- based laboratory surveillance for soon anticipated new vaccines (dataset analyses and chart reviews). Our 5y-old NVSN has experienced personnel, accurate laboratory and surveillance techniques, and the ability to respond quickly to new needs. This proposal will provide information integral to developing sound polices consistent with national goals to preventing VPD in children.\",\n",

We propose to continue varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) active surveillance and extend the project to the city of Santa Clarita to increase the population to over 500,000. We plan to maintain active surveillance for both varicella and HZ, standardize case verification, complete case reports, document varicella vaccine usage, and continue surveillance data evaluation. VASP has collaborated with other varicella surveillance study sites in various epidemiological projects from 1994-present. We plan to conduct two applied epidemiologic research projects. The first project will evaluate if proactive on-site school varicella vaccination of susceptible students versus the standard practiceof referring children to their medical provider once the first varicella case is confirmed will decrease number of subsequent varicella cases. The second project will analyze zoster hospitalizations from 1992-2007, utilizing ICD-9 discharge codes denoted with the first 8 hospital discharge diagnoses. We will review medical charts and analyze HZ rates for incidence trends pre- and post-widespread varicella vaccine usage. Additionally, we are applying to conduct surveillance for rotavirus infection (RVI). We will utilize the existing VASP infrastructure and develop sites for RVI active surveillance throughout AV and the city of Santa Clarita. We will establish biweekly RVI data collection at active surveillance sites and will determine the incidence of RVI in clinic, emergency room, and inpatient settings. We will evaluate our system by calculating incidence of diarrhea due to RVI in hospital and emergency room utilizing ICD-9 discharge diagnosis codes for diarrhea due to RVI. When the new RV vaccine, Rotashield, is released, we will measure vaccine usage and its impact on RVI incidence.\",\n",

Our specific aims include: 1) conducting active population-based surveillance for vaccine preventable diseases throughout the Nashville/Davidson County population and performing epidemiologic and health services research on vaccine impact by utilizing the Tennessee Medicaid database; 2) assessing issues related to provider implementation of new vaccine recommendations; and 3) enhancing inpatient and outpatient surveillance of children with fever and/or acute respiratory disease in Davidson County. A particular focus of our work during the upcoming funding period will be on influenza. With the new recommendation of routine influenza vaccination for children ages 6 -23 months, an immunization survey will be conducted in area practices to determine the influenza vaccine coverage rate for healthy children ages 6- 23 months, as well as older children with high-risk medical conditions in a representative sample of County children. In addition, surveys of primary care providers will help determine provider and practice characteristics that influence adoption of these new vaccine recommendations. Influenza vaccine effectiveness will evaluated for the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 influenza seasons using a case cohort design. Exposure to influenza vaccine will use data obtained from the outpatient practice survey. Cases will be identified with augmented inpatient surveillance which will attempt to enroll all County children aged < 5 years hospitalized with influenza 6 days/week as well as a representative sample of children seen only in the emergency room for influenza. These data will be instrumental in assessingthe impact of the new influenza vaccination recommendations. The utility of this network in evaluating new vaccines and vaccine policies is great.',\n",
       " 'Following the introduction of the varicella vaccine in the U.S. in 1995, the incidence of wild-type varicella declined dramatically in vaccinated populations. However, each year a small proportion of vaccinated persons experiences breakthrough varicella, which usually manifests as a mild, atypical presentation that can be difficult to diagnose. In addition, herpes zoster after vaccination is not uncommon, and vaccine-type varicella virus has been isolated from some cases. In response to Objective Two of PA-04116 (conduct applied research for varicella and/or herpes zoster), we will study breakthrough varicella and post-vaccination herpes zoster. Our study objectives are (1) To measure the reliability of provider diagnosis of breakthrough varicella by comparing provider diagnosis with laboratory PCR results; (2) To examine cases of herpes zoster after varicella vaccination, specifically identifying the virus strains (wild-type versus vaccine-type) and calculating incidence rates of vaccine- related herpes zoster. These investigations will be conducted in the population of Kaiser Permanente Northwest, a closed-panel health maintenance organization with the ability to identify and enroll cases as they present to the medical system. Laboratory isolation of varicella virus and identification of virus strain through PCR will be conducted at the Centers for Disease Control varicella laboratory. KPNW researchers and the CDC laboratory have worked together previously on similar studies. This proposed study offers the opportunity to collect population-based information on important sequelae of varicella vaccination.',\n",
       " 'Influenza causes epidemics of respiratory infection in young children each winter. Children under 23 months of age, particularly those under 6 months of age are most vulnerable to suffering from complications secondary to influenza infection. Consequently, influenza vaccine has been recommended for children 6-23 months of age. Unfortunately influenza vaccine is not approved for use in children under 6 month of age who are at highest risk. Therefore, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended vaccination of household contacts of children under 6 month of age particularly their mothers.  The current study is a hospital-based study to assess the effectiveness of a program to vaccinate birth mothers and household contacts of newboms with influenza vaccine. We propose to study both birth mothers and household contacts of newborns delivered at Durham Regional Hospital and Duke University Medical Center, birthing hospitals serving Durham and surrounding counties in central North Carolina. We will implement several strategies to increase vaccine coverage rates at Durham Regional Hospital utilizing Duke University Medical Center as a control setting. Strategies will include: standing vaccine orders for birth mothers, vaccine reminders for household contacts, and a hospital based influenza vaccine clinic to increase vaccine accessibility. Vaccine coverage rates will be assessed utilizing a survey method and self report of the birth mothers. Demographic determinants of vaccine coverage and reasons for refusal of influenza vaccine will be assessed as well.  This study is important and a natural study for our research group to conduct. We are currently investigating the role of influenza vaccine in children under six months of age. In addition we have recently assessed influenza vaccine coverage rates of asthmatics cared for in the Duke Health System. This study will continue to establish the role our group in the field of influenza vaccine research.  This study has the potential of impacting recommendations for how best to accomplish administering influenza vaccine to women delivering newborns during the influenza season. If successful, other hospitals may adopt influenza vaccination programs of new mothers and other household contacts and potentially decrease the burden of influenza illness in young children.',\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] Reminder/recall has been demonstrated to be an effective means of improving vaccination rates among children, yet its use has not been widely adopted. Immunization providers cite perceived staff time and cost as major factors impeding the adoption of reminder/recall. The proposed study will assess the effectiveness of a centralized reminder/recall intervention toward improving the immunization status of children in the urban area of Detroit, MI. Three reminder/recall strategies will be employed during the intervention: 7-month recall of children who are not up-to-date for vaccine recommended for receipt by six months of age; 12-month reminder for all children, to emphasize vaccination early in the second year of life; and 19-month recall of children who are not up-to-date for the primary immunization series. For each of the 3 strategies, an intervention arm will be paired with a control arm, to serve as the basis for assessment of reminder/recall effectiveness. The 3 strategies will be implemented and assessed independently, and compared to each other with regard to cost-effectiveness.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The specific aims are to 1) develop a centralized reminder/recall intervention, that targets key age groups, incorporates the needs and preferences of both immunization providers and parents, and builds on existing capabilities of a high-functioning statewide immunization registry; 2) conduct a randomized controlled trial of the centralized reminder/recall intervention in a large urban area with historically low vaccination rates; and 3) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each reminder/recall intervention strategy, to inform future efforts to implement centralized reminder/recall systems.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] The proposed project is unique in that it focuses on a large, racially and socioeconomically diverse, urban area with documented low vaccination rates; it features 3 different reminder/recall strategies targeted to key points in the children's vaccination schedule; it encompasses both personalized, patient-directed reminder/recall and vaccine-specific provider cues to action; and it incorporates a rigorous randomized controlled design.

       " \"   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood vaccines have been identified as one of the top 10 greatest achievements in public health in the 20th century, and new vaccines recommended already in the 21st century promise additional reductions in morbidity and mortality for children and adults. However, the rapidly expanding immunization schedule and increasingly expensive vaccines threaten the fiscal stability of public vaccine financing at federal and state levels. In the fragile public-private partnership at the core of United States vaccination efforts, public officials negotiate with private vaccine manufacturers to set federal contract prices. Public officials prefer lower prices in order to provide as many recommended vaccines as possible to vulnerable children, whereas manufacturers prefer higher prices that yield sufficient return on investment and capital for future vaccine development. To minimize risk for both parties, there is a need for better symmetry of information about manufacturers' investments in vaccine development and commercialization [including responses to the Food and drug Administration (FDA) regulatory efforts], and about program officials' price expectations for newly recommended vaccines relative to previously recommended vaccines. The investigators propose a two-year research project with the following specific aims: (1) To develop and evaluate a conceptual model of observable factors that contribute to the costs of vaccine development, commercialization, and pricing, using expert primary sources; (2) To translate the conceptual model into a working model of development/commercialization costs and pricing for vaccines, using an array of confidential primary industry sources and publicly available secondary sources; (3) To operationalize the working model of vaccine costs and pricing as a user-friendly tool with observable inputs that can be used in the future by federal immunization program staff and manufacturers. This vaccine cost/price tool will be of great value in the ongoing partnership between public health and vaccine manufacturing interests. RELEVANCE OF RESEARCH TO PUBLIC HEALTH: The public-private partnership between public immunization programs and vaccine manufacturers is strained by increasing prices of vaccines. The government wants to understand better how the costs of developing and producing new vaccines inform prices. Manufacturers want the government to understand their level of investment in vaccine development. This research will yield a tool to help improve mutual understanding of these issues.            \",\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immunizations for adolescents have become much more complex in recent years, with the licensure of a conjugate vaccine to prevent meningococcal disease, another vaccine to prevent human papillomavirus, and new tetanus toxoid-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine. Additional vaccine recommendations affecting adolescents are likely in the near future, including a recommendation for universal influenza vaccination and future development and licensure of vaccines to prevent cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and potentially Chlamydia trachomatis. In part due to the success of vaccination, the primary causes of morbidity and mortality during adolescence relate to preventable health behaviors, including tobacco, alcohol and drug use, risky sexual activity, mental health, and injury. Adolescent preventive services guidelines have been developed and endorsed by multiple professional organizations, including the American Medical Association (AMA), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the US Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) to guide physicians in providing preventive counseling and screening for these health issues. Yet it is unclear how physicians prioritize adolescent vaccine delivery along with clinical preventive services (CPS) delivery, and whether vaccine delivery enhances or impedes delivery of other preventive services. This project will assess family physicians' and pediatricians' knowledge, attitude towards and practice of adolescent preventive services delivery through key informant interviews and focus groups. We will also qualitatively evaluate how physicians in a variety of settings (urban, suburban, rural, underserved) and practice types (health maintenance organizations, private, clinic/community health center) prioritize CPS for adolescents, and we will assess potential methods to improve CPS delivery. To quantify the delivery of CPS and immunizations, we will perform chart reviews of 400 adolescents, and interview those adolescents (aged 11-14 and 15-18) and their parents (200 parents of those aged 11-14) in practices in upstate New York. These interviews will also improve our understanding of the attitudes of parents and adolescents toward CPS. The results of this project will guide future educational and practice-based strategies to increase rates of CPS and immunization delivery for adolescents. to Public Health Our project will explore how physicians are balancing the delivery of immunizations concurrently with other preventive services for adolescents. Finding successful methods for delivery of immunizations along with effective counseling and screening will decrease the rate of vaccine preventable diseases in this population, and will reduce the more common morbidities related to risky behaviors in adolescence.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to enhance the nation's ability to vaccinate adolescents in primary care practices. Most adolescents >11 years are now eligible to receive newly licensed adolescent vaccinations including human papilloma virus (HPV), meningococcal vaccine and tetanus-pertussis vaccine (TdaP). This new era of adolescent vaccinations will require additional visits to primary care practices for many adolescents. Systems are needed to track, remind, and recall adolescents for needed immunizations, particularly among low-income adolescents who have lower vaccination rates and fewer preventive healthcare visits. A potentially efficient strategy for reminder/recall for adolescents is to base these systems in managed care, since most adolescents are enrolled in health insurance organizations. Therefore, the aims of this study are to: 1. Design an adolescent immunization reminder/recall system with mailed or telephone messages, and based in managed care settings for low-income populations in the Rochester New York, region. 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of this managed care-based adolescent immunization reminder/recall system using a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to test mailed versus telephone (autodialer-based) reminder/recall versus control. Implement the RCT across diverse practices (pediatric/family physician, and different practice types) and adolescent populations (11-18yrs, and urban/suburban/rural regions). 3. Evaluate and compare the costs, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of the mailed / telephone systems. 4. Disseminate findings in collaboration with public health and professional organizations. For Aim 1, we will pilot test the reminder/recall systems and messages using qualitative methods, with input from parents, adolescents, and managed care experts. For Aim 2 we will evaluate, over 12 months, the effectiveness of mailed reminders vs telephone reminders vs standard of care control in improving (a) adolescent vaccination rates and (b) preventive visits and other preventive services. We will randomize 5,000 adolescents across 40 primary care practices in upstate NY. We will test the impact of reminder/recall using bivariate and multivariate analyses, for the entire population, and for subgroups of (a) adolescents (by age, gender, urban/suburban/rural residence); (b) practices (pediatric or family MD, and private office/clinic/health center); and (c) insurance (Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program). For Aim 3 we will measure and compare costs of the two reminder systems, and their cost-effectiveness, and will assess feasibility and generalizability to different settings. For Aim 4 we will work with experts to disseminate findings. By rigorously evaluating the effectiveness of immunization reminder/recall for adolescents across a wide spectrum of patients and practices, this study will provide critical information for practitioners and immunization and public health leaders to implement strategies to enhance adolescent immunizations and preventive care.   [unreadable] Public Health Statement: Immunizations are one of the greatest public health achievements. The new era of adolescent immunizations will require new strategies to protect millions of adolescents from vaccine-preventable diseases including human papilloma virus (HPV), meningococcal vaccine, and tetanus-pertussis vaccine (TdaP).

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although patient reminder/recall systems have been shown to be effective at improving vaccination coverage levels for infants and younger children, little is known about the effectiveness of such systems for increasing immunization rates in adolescent populations. The process of reminder/recall in adolescents, and vaccination of adolescents overall, presents particular challenges. Adolescents are less likely to routinely access health care compared to younger children and adults. In addition, other obstacles such as lack of health insurance, missed opportunities for vaccination during health care visits, and the scattering of immunization records across multiple providers have posed major challenges in the vaccination of adolescents. Issues of parental consent for vaccination can also be problematic, given that adolescents may present for care without their parents accompanying them. These and other barriers to immunization may reduce the effectiveness of reminder/recall for adolescents. In the current proposal, a study team with extensive experience in immunization delivery research will investigate the ability of pediatricians and family physicians in a number of different practice settings to implement a reminder/recall system for their adolescent patient populations. The study will include seven types of clinical settings including pediatric and family medicine practices, urban and rural practices, community health clinics and managed care organization sites. In addition, we will be able to examine the effectiveness of reminder/recall originating at public school-based health centers, an innovative strategy that has not previously been reported. Randomized controlled trials of reminder recall for adolescents will be conducted at each type of site, with randomization at the level of the patient. The study team will track important process measures during reminder/recall including the percentage of eligible population who actually received intervention; percentage with incorrect addresses; percentage with incorrect or disconnected phones; percentage with up-to-date vaccinations but incorrectly recalled; missed vaccination opportunities; and invalid doses of vaccines administered. In this way, we will be able to not only determine the degree to which reminder/recall was successful for adolescents, but also identify impediments to success, which will provide a foundation for future efforts. Our study will also investigate the cost of establishing and operating a reminder/recall system for adolescents in each type of clinical setting. Finally, in two practices we will examine parental attitudes regarding patient-directed reminder/recall in which parents select their preferred method of contact, including such innovative methods as text messaging using cellular telephones or e-mail reminders. Although patient reminder/recall systems have been shown to be effective at improving vaccination coverage levels in young children, little is known about the effectiveness of such systems for increasing immunization rates in adolescents, a population in which several new vaccines have recently been recommended. This large randomized controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of reminder/recall for adolescents in seven different types of practice settings including pediatric and family medicine private practices, community health clinics, health maintenance organization settings, rural settings and school-based health centers. The study will provide important information to guide future public health efforts to achieve high rates of immunization in adolescents.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although progress has been made toward achieving the Healthy People 2010 immunization objectives, pockets of undervaccinated children remain throughout the United States, especially those living in urban areas. The failure of parents or providers to recognize that a child is due (or overdue) for vaccinations is a persistent problem and an important underlying cause of inadequate vaccination. In response, the past decade has witnessed unprecedented growth of immunization registries which track immunization records and assess vaccination status. Most immunization registries are also capable of generating individualized notices for children that require vaccinations. Notification may be made by mail, telephone or computer to either encourage appointments for upcoming scheduled vaccinations (reminders) or those doses that are overdue (recalls). There is ample evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of immunization reminder/recall. An important barrier to achieving the full potential of registry-based reminder / recall systems is the accuracy and completeness of parents\\' contact information. Without accurate contact information, mailed reminder/ recall notices cannot be delivered to the appropriate parties and telephone messages cannot reach the intended recipients. Prior reports indicate that failures to contact parents with mail or telephone reminder/recall notices are commonplace. The proposed study will develop and evaluate innovative approaches to successfully contact parents regarding the specific immunizations their child needs. The specific aims of the Innovations to Improve Successful Contact of Parents for Immunization Reminders program are to: (1) describe the methods currently used by a statewide immunization registry to update parent contact information; (2) evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of existing registry data in contacting parents; (3) identify new strategies for generating and updating parent contact information; (4) identify innovative strategies to contact parents of children in the registry who cannot be contacted by mail or telephone; (5) evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of new strategies in terms of both successful parent contact and changes in vaccination status; and (6) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of new strategies. The proposed study is unique in that it focuses on the experiences of one of the nation\\'s largest and most advanced statewide immunization registries. We will explore a broad array of existing information systems as potential new sources of parent contact information as well as the most effective means to successfully update immunization registry data. For those individuals that cannot be reliably contacted through mail or telephone notices, we will develop and test new contact methods targeted to \"unreachable\" populations. Results of the study will serve to inform efforts in other states and communities to improve parent contact information in immunization registries. Immunization registries are useful mechanisms to conduct immunization reminder/recall; however, inaccurate parent contact information limits the effectiveness of registries for this purpose. This project will develop and evaluate different strategies to improve the parent contact information included in a state immunization registry.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Because a number of new vaccines and new uses of existing vaccines now target adolescents, the development of effective strategies to immunize this age group is critical, and is emerging as an area of great interest for a variety of communities. This study will investigate the relationship between the immunization of adolescents and the delivery of other preventive services to adolescents 11-18 years of age. Specifically we will determine current rates for delivery of both immunizations and other recommended clinical preventive services (CPS). We will examine immunization- and CPS-related attitudes and prioritization among physicians who care for adolescents, and look at the relationships between the delivery of each type of service. These observations will be stratified by age (11-14 and 15-18 years), provider type (pediatrician vs. family practice), clinic type (HMO, private practice, community health center, and public health center), clinic location, and vaccine. We will also look at perception and understanding of the adolescents and their parents regarding preventive services received. The results from these investigations will facilitate the planning of strategies to enhance the delivery of both immunizations and other recommended preventive services to adolescent populations. Specific Goals 1. Evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and experiences of pediatricians and family practitioners regarding delivery of immunizations and other clinical preventive services (CPS) to adolescents through the use of in- depth key informant interviews. 2. Determine how pediatricians and family practitioners prioritize immunizations and other CPS recommendations for adolescents through the use of in-depth key informant interviews. 3. Establish a baseline rate for delivery of target vaccines and selected age-appropriate CPS and determine the relationship between the deliveries of these two services. 4. Survey parents and adolescents to document the receipt of immunizations and the receipt and understanding of CPS. 5. Survey parents and adolescents to determine the proportion of adolescents stratified by age that seek care from providers other than pediatricians and family physicians. For those cared for by these other provider types determine the degree to which immunizations or CPS are delivered in these settings. This study will help determine if receipt of the new immunizations for adolescents, ages 11-18, is associated with receipt of other recommended preventive health services for this age group, and will provide the basis of strategies for improving their delivery.

Ongoing vaccine economic research is needed to inform national policy recommendations, as well as programmatic choices by state immunization program managers, health insurers, and providers. Specific Aims. We request continued support of the Joint Initiative in Vaccine Economics (JIVE) Project, which supports research by Harvard and CDC investigators. We will conduct four studies. Study 1 will address the RFA's 1st objective, to estimate the costs associated with introducing combination vaccines into pediatric practices. Study 2 will address the RFA's 2nd and 3rd objectives, to develop criteria for assessing the usefulness of existing vaccine selection algorithms and identify key factors in decisions about combination vaccines; and to assess the usefulness of an existing vaccine algorithm and measure societal values for the benefits and risks of combination vaccines. Study 3 will use newly available data to generate standardized estimates of the cost-effectiveness of expanding routine influenza vaccination to all age groups. Study 4 will be determined with guidance from CDC collaborators. Investigators and Environment. The highly successful JIVE Project is a collaboration between Harvard and CDC investigators led by Tracy Lieu, MD, MPH, Lisa Prosser, PhD, and Grace Lee, MD, MPH, who are national leaders in vaccine economics. Now in its sixth year, the project has produced many studies with high impact on vaccine policy. Research Plan. Study 1 will estimate the costs of combination vaccines using semi- structured interviews with pediatric health care practices and data from existing studies. Study 2 will include (1) qualitative interviews with a variety of stakeholders to identify key factors in decisions on combination vaccines; and (2) an internet-based survey with persons representative of the U.S. population. The survey will include a discrete choice experiment, an innovative approach to estimating values for the benefits and risks of combination vaccines. In Study 3, we will expand an existing model on influenza vaccination to address both children and adults and to use newly available data. Innovation and Policy Implications. This project will generate crucial information for policy and programmatic decisions. By using innovations such as discrete choice experiments, we will also advance the use of economic methods in health care. Economic research on vaccines is needed to support informed policy and programmatic decisions by the government and other key parties. In this project we will continue the highly successful Joint Initiative in Vaccine Economics, which supports collaborative research by investigators at Harvard and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We will conduct several studies, including evaluations of the costs and values associated with new combination vaccines and of the cost-effectiveness of expanding influenza vaccination to additional age groups in the United States.

In order to reach Healthy People 2010 goals for the immunization of preschool children there must be increased emphasis on the effective delivery of vaccines. The US Task Force on Immunization Delivery strongly recommends that pediatric providers implement some type of provider based reminder/recall system to improve immunization delivery. Yet barriers exist that prevent some practices from achieving adequate immunization delivery. Our primary hypothesis is that provider reminders focused on a particular age group (18 month olds) can be efficiently added to office based systems and increase the rate of delivery of immunizations to those children. The aims of this project are as follows: 1) Within a diverse set of private offices, determine the effectiveness of a provider prompt for needed vaccines at 19 months of age, 2) Assess the challenges and test solutions for a practice to institute a provider prompt for needed vaccines on the medical record of 18 month children within a diverse set of practices 3) Identify the challenges and test solutions to completing the immunization of 18 month old patients (becoming up to date) within a diverse set of practices, and 4) Determine predictors of successful immunization by practice and patient factors including: A. patient factor- including insurance, race, ethnicity, previous vaccine history and B. Practice factors-including practice type, location (rural, suburban, urban), patient assignment (one physician, common assignment), medical record type (electronic medical record). This project will take place in a regional practice-based research network, the South Carolina Pediatric Practice Research Network (SCPPRN), with 8 pediatric practices and approximately 133,000 visits per year. Four practices use an electronic medical record (EMR), and four use paper medical records. SCPPRN also has a diverse population of rural, suburban, and urban populations. The participating practices current procedures and practices around the delivery of immunizations will be measured and optimized for the provider reminder. Practice implementation of the provider reminder interventions are expected to be diverse, and could range from a flag system in the (EMR) to post-it notes on a paper medical chart. The implementation of the intervention will utilize practice-based quality improvement, including a face to face group training, onsite assessments and monthly conference calls. Process measures such as number of prompts, visits and vaccines delivered will be measured monthly and problems addressed. It will be critical to identify interventions that will be efficient, effective, and sustainable in the practice. Immunization rates will be measured at the beginning and the end of the study, and change in these rates within practice will be the primary outcome measure. The outcome is vaccination series complete at 19 months, as well as a measure of time it takes until up to date status is achieved. We will also compare results between practices, particularly differences between practices and patients by practice and patient characteristics. This project is designed to test whether implementation of a provider reminder/recall or prompting system will be effective in increasing the rate of immunization delivery to 18 month old children. Utilizing diverse patient populations, including poor and minority patients, the implementation of the reminder/prompting and recall system will occur in suburban, urban, and rural practice settings.

The research objectives of this program are to 1) evaluate the impact of new vaccines or new vaccine policies on disease in site populations, 2) evaluate the impact of new vaccines or new vaccine policies on administration of other vaccines and 3) understand the burden of vaccine preventable diseases or potentially vaccine preventable diseases in the population. The intent of the NVSN program is to utilize a network of population-based sites to conduct active surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARI) and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in addition to providing a framework in which to study other important vaccine related questions. We propose to continue our work in conducting population-based surveillance in Hamilton County, Ohio for acute respiratory infections and acute gastroenteritis to better understand the burden of influenza and rotavirus and to conduct applied epidemiologic studies to examine the impact of influenza and rotavirus vaccines in our community. Proposed studies include vaccine effectiveness studies using case-control and case-cohort methods, determining the cost of rotavirus disease in children hospitalized or cared for as outpatients or in the ED and assessing the background rate of intussusception. In addition, we propose conducting a series of complementary studies in collaborating pediatric practice networks to assess the impact of new vaccines on immunization providers. Specifically, we will evaluate the impact of new vaccines on immunization coverage levels and the number of injections administered per up-to-date child, provider knowledge, attitudes, intentions, and self-reported practices regarding use of new and combination vaccines and the cost impact of new vaccines on pediatric practices and their immunization delivery. We have provided evidence of our extensive experience developing surveillance systems in both the hospital and emergency department at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) and our ability to work effectively within our community with health care providers and public health agencies as well as collaboratively with the existing NVSN sites and the CDC. We are thus in a unique position to provide the extensive services and expertise required in this application. The NVSN will address a number of priority areas in the Healthy People 2010 objectives. The infrastructure of such a network along with carefully planned research activities utilizing population-based enhanced surveillance and computerized databases with disease and immunization histories will provide the data needed to examine progress towards meeting the Healthy People 2010 objectives. Immunization and infectious disease issues are a top priority in the US as described in Healthy People 2010 objectives. Several of these objectives such as the reduction or elimination of vaccine preventable diseases (objective 14-1) and the evaluation of vaccination coverage for universally recommended vaccines (objective 14-22), are addressed in this application. Population-based surveillance will assess the disease burden of specific infections while applied epidemiologic studies assessing vaccine coverage will identify barriers to good coverage. Providing accurate rates of intussusception (IS), a potential adverse event of rotavirus vaccine is also addressed in this application (objective 14-30).

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality nearly every year; when pandemics occur, the impact is even more severe. A pandemic virus may result from reassortment of human viruses with animal influenza viruses carrying avian influenza genes. Such reassortment may occur more readily in tropical climates where human and animal viruses frequently co-circulate throughout the year. Few data are available to document the transmission and burden of influenza in tropical developing countries. Without a better understanding of influenza epidemiology in such situations, it is difficult for national and global public health officials to develop influenza control strategies for either seasonal or pandemic influenza. Effective inactivated influenza vaccines have been available for decades, but data are lacking on their effectiveness for both protecting recipients in tropical developing countries and also their ability to reduce transmission in such populations. A number of reports from developed countries indicate that influenza vaccine, when given to a limited number of persons most responsible for transmission, usually children, has the potential to interrupt transmission and reduce the overall influenza burden in a community. The potential of influenza vaccine to provide indirect protection to unvaccinated individuals suggests that targeted use, which may be feasible in developing country settings, might reduce influenza infection in the community. In a pandemic situation, these efforts could slow the spread of pandemic virus and provide sufficient time for public health officials to introduce interventions to contain or blunt the effects of a pandemic. Thus, to evaluate the effectiveness of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in a tropical developing country, we propose to conduct an observer-blind, cluster-randomized, active-control, parallel-group, phase IV trial in Senegal. The trial will take place over a three-year period and will target children 6 months to 10 years of age for vaccination. Not only will effectiveness be estimated for child vaccine recipients, but indirect effectiveness will also be measured for the rest of the community. Throughout the course of the study, both sentinel and active surveillance will be conducted to document the occurrence of influenza-like illness among participants and in the community. The primary outcome will be prevention of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza meeting a case definition. Surveillance will also allow us to describe the epidemiology of influenza in a tropical developing country by defining the rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza and by describing the clinical characteristics of influenza in the population.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Acute respiratory infections result in ~ 1.9 million childhood deaths per year, 20% of the deaths are in India. The disease burden of influenza among children in India is ill defined but is likely substantial. Influenza vaccines are in routine use in children in the US, although licensed in India, they are seldom given. Indeed, it is not known whether influenza vaccine efficacy in a tropical developing country will be the same as in developed countries. Specific Aim 1. Describe influenza vaccine direct and indirect efficacy. This aim will be accomplished by determining the efficacy of influenza vaccination in children six months of age through primary school on decreasing the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza in the children; and determining the indirect effects of influenza vaccination on laboratory-confirmed influenza among unvaccinated individuals who are living in the same communities in rural India using a prospective, group randomized, controlled, observer-blinded study. All individuals (children and adults) in both communities who participate in the study will be actively monitored by weekly visits for the occurrence of febrile acute respiratory illness (FARI, reported fever and any respiratory complaint). Each FARI will be further characterized on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, including pulse oximetry, and a respiratory specimen will be collected. A major subset of FARIs will undergo realtime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing for influenza, positive samples will be subjected to culture for virus isolation. Vaccine related adverse events will be monitored and reported. Specific Aim 2. Define influenza clinical disease and outcomes. This aim will be accomplished by defining the rates and epidemiological characteristics of influenza disease outcomes in persons of all ages who are living in the study communities, including the incidence of severe disease. The clinical presentations of influenza disease, including co-morbid conditions, influenza-related complications, and risk factors associated with more severe illness due to influenza will be identified. In addition to defining the direct and indirect protective effect of influenza vaccine, these studies will develop capacity for influenza virus study and management in second largest country in the world.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, influenza vaccine coverage levels remain far below Health People 2010 goals. The vast majority of annual influenza vaccinations are provided during the months of October-December. This is due to the availability of vaccine, provider practices and public expectations. The expansion of the groups recommended for annual vaccination means that current provider capabilities will be challenged. If recommendations and vaccine availability are expanded to include the entire population, provider and public health capacity will be severely tested. Since the seasonal peak in influenza cases is most common in February, expanding the season into the month of February is a viable strategy. We propose to work with a diverse sample of medical providers to improve annual influenza coverage by promoting use of evidence based interventions shown to improve immunization coverage expansion (ICE). The primary interventions anticipated include: patient and provider reminder/recall systems (including those incorporated in electronic medical record systems and the County\\'s web-based immunization registry), standing orders, and assessment and feedback for providers. Many of the interventions build upon existing capabilities of providers and our County Immunization Branch. The primary goal will be to extend use of these interventions through February. To accomplish this expansion, we will investigate barriers to ICE, assess readiness and capacity for change, and prepare \"tool kits\" to facilitate practice changes. To allow better comparisons, after initial assessment we plan to allocate stratified or matched practice sites into two levels of intervention; intensive and information only. To assess the changes in coverage, patterns of intervention adoption and other changes in provider practices we will conduct follow-up assessments in all practices. Information will be collected from practices using a combination of qualitative and quantitative surveys. Primary outcomes include change in influenza vaccine coverage rate and reduction of missed opportunities to administer influenza vaccine. Cost analysis will assess incremental costs incurred to extend the vaccination season. Summative evaluation will include assessment of how practices overcome barriers, select and implement interventions as well as prospects for sustainability of an extended season.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable] Although most adults realize the significance of immunizations for infant and child health, many do not recognize that vaccines offer a safe, cost-effective way to prevent morbidity and mortality among adolescents and adults. Nearly 45,000 US adults die each year from vaccine preventable diseases. The Institute of Medicine has called for the development of innovative strategies to improve vaccine coverage among adolescents and adults. Obstetrician-Gynecologists (Ob/Gyns) are uniquely positioned to immunize women of all ages against vaccine-preventable diseases. They are often the first point of contact for young women seeking care for reproductive health. Ob/Gyns function as primary care physicians, providing ? of all medical visits to women aged 17- 21 years. However, many Ob/Gyns do not routinely assess immunization status or administer vaccines in their offices. Commonly noted obstacles to providing vaccinations include cost/inadequate reimbursement, beliefs about their role in primary care, inadequate vaccine handling capability, lack of vaccine information, and safety/liability concerns in pregnancy. Our primary objective is to conduct a clinic-based study to develop and assess the effectiveness of a vaccination program for adolescent and adult women in the community Ob/Gyn setting. We propose to evaluate 4 Ob/Gyn offices in the Raleigh-Durham, NC area through in-depth, structured interviews of Ob/Gyn providers and office staff. In addition to details on current vaccine practices, medical record documentation, and encounter coding reimbursement, personnel will be queried on attitudes about vaccination, perceived barriers to an Ob/Gyn-based program, and ideas on overcoming such barriers. Findings will be used to design a program for adolescent and adult women, tailored for implementation in 2 of the 4 Ob/Gyn offices. Limited to vaccines for human papillomavirus and influenza & pertussis in pregnancy/postpartum, the program will cover a 12-month period, including 1 influenza season. Effectiveness of the intervention will be determined by pre- and post-program vaccination rates, program satisfaction, and willingness to continue the program. Detailed recording of all development and implementation strategies will allow for direct and immediate quantification of the resources and financial support required for vaccine program development and performance.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  [unreadable]   [unreadable] Despite the availability of vaccines against influenza and pertussis, infants less than 6 months of age are not eligible to be vaccinated against influenza, are too young to be completely vaccinated against pertussis and therefore remain vulnerable to pertussis and influenza. Both pertussis and influenza in very young infants have significant morbidity (primarily hospitalization) and at times death. Studies have shown that an adolescent or adult contact is often the source of these two respiratory pathogens for infants and children. Because of this, it is postulated that one of the best means of protecting these infants is to vaccinate the household contacts, especially the birth mother. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that persons who have close contact with young infants receive influenza vaccine as well as combined tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid and reduced dose acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). However, data reveal that only 13 percent of mothers of newborns report receiving influenza vaccine and limited data for uptake of Tdap in birth mothers  [unreadable] are available. Strategies to improve vaccine delivery of Tdap and influenza to household contacts of newborns, especially birth mothers, are needed. The primary aim of this project is to develop and implement a hospital-based strategy of vaccinating birth mothers with Tdap year round and influenza vaccine during influenza season (October to March) using a standing order. In addition, this project seeks to define barriers and to develop and implement strategies to vaccinate household contacts of newborn infants with Tdap (year-round) and influenza during the influenza season. The proposal seeks to implement a standing order for vaccination of birth mothers during hospitalization at a community hospital,including documenting the processes, evaluating the barriers encountered and strategies with the most success, and comparing the overall vaccination uptake (effectiveness of these strategies) with a control community hospital. Methods developed, coupled with educational materials, will then form a tool-kit that will be shared with other hospitals nationally for implementation. This proposal also seeks to explore an expanding role of the hospital-based pharmacists in providing vaccines to household contacts. In addition, the proposal will consider the cost-benefit of a standing order related to the predicted prevention of morbidity and mortality in young infants due to pertussis and influenza.

       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   [unreadable]   [unreadable] ACIP has now recommended influenza vaccination for all children 6 months to 18 years of age. While many school-aged children will be vaccinated in the medical home, the large number of children for whom the vaccine is now recommended exceeds the capacity of many primary care settings. Schools have been recommended as potential sites for influenza vaccination, yet little is known about the feasibility, implementation requirements, costs, or effectiveness of school- based influenza vaccination (SIV) programs. This project will implement and rigorously evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, billing and reimbursement components, costs, cost-effectiveness, and overall effectiveness of an SIV program that targets diverse populations and different intensities of a recruitment advertising intervention. The Monroe County SIV will integrate five sets of activities: 1) SIV program implementation in 24 elementary schools; 2) a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing SIV vs. standard-of-care and an RCT of high- vs. low-intensity SIV; 3) economic analyses regarding income generation and costs of SIV with extrapolation to the U.S.; 4) associated quantitative studies that will shed light on implementation issues including vaccine refusal, parents' attitudes and beliefs regarding SIV, and teachers' perceptions of vaccination in participating and non-participating schools; and 5) qualitative studies examining attitudes and beliefs of various groups including parents, mass vaccinators, school personnel, and insurers. Key factors of strategic importance to this proposal include: the significance to the nation of results that will be generated by the proposed body of work, the approach that interweaves collaborative program implementation and carefully constructed evaluation; an innovative nesting of randomized controlled trials (RCT) testing both SIV vs. Standard-of-care and High-Intensity vs. Low-Intensity interventions; a team of investigators with one of the U.S.'s top records in immunization research including RCTs, economic studies and modeling, quantitative surveys, and qualitative research; and an environment that ensures success because of long-standing collaborations between the Monroe County Department of Public Health, a nursing organization experienced in mass vaccinations, the NYS Department of Health, academicians at the University of Rochester Medical Center, the local school districts, pediatric and family physician professional organizations, and health care insurers.  [unreadable]   [unreadable] PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   [unreadable]   [unreadable] The relevance of this research to public health is that - just as ACIP has recommended influenza vaccination for all children 6 months to 18 years of age - the proposed Monroe County project would both implement a school-based influenza vaccination (SIV) program and study the program's costs and benefits (vaccine uptake) while examining billing and reimbursement from the perspective of a party capable of billing insurers for vaccination. The innovative nesting of randomized controlled trials testing both SIV vs. Standard-of-care and High-Intensity vs. Low- Intensity interventions is further strengthened by a carefully crafted set of economic studies and modeling, quantitative surveys, and qualitative research.

Adolescents are less frequently seen for preventive health services than other age groups, often do not have a connection with a traditional medical home, and may present for care without their parents, complicating issues of consent. Therefore, developing sustainable vaccination programs in complementary health care settings to supplement care received in a medical home is crucial to the widespread delivery of adolescent vaccinations on a population level. Schools offer an opportunity to deliver new vaccines to adolescents who may not have received them in their medical home. However, vaccines are expensive and schools have limited resources for health-related activities. Sustainable programs are needed which provide school-based vaccinations to eligible students in order to maximize immunization coverage for these vaccines. In the current proposal, a study team with extensive research experience in immunization delivery will investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and cost of implementing an adolescent vaccination program at eight middle schools in Denver and will develop a process for billing third party payers. This project will capitalize on the relationships being developed for a pilot project in late 2008 that will provide Tdap to eligible adolescents in eight middle schools in the Denver Public Schools (DPS) district. Using the foundation developed from this pilot project, we will develop the necessary strategies to implement and then evaluate a school-based immunization program in partnership with Denver Community Health Services that will vaccinate adolescents and bill third party payers. The program will plan to provide all adolescent vaccinations to eligible teens at eight middle schools in DPS and bill the appropriate insurer for the services provided.

       " ' OVERVIEW Children are an important vector for the spread of influenza in households and communities. Healthy school-aged children have a high attack rate during annual influenza epidemics, and illness in this age group is associated with high rates of school absenteeism. Immunizing school-age children against influenza has been shown to result in significant reductions in influenza burden in other population groups as a result of decreased exposure to and transmission of influenza viruses. Therefore, focusing efforts for influenza vaccination on healthy children is an effective and practical strategy for reducing the burden of disease in the community. Currently, most influenza vaccination occurs in clinics, but little is known about the potential capacity of these clinical settings to meet any increase in demand. Schools offer an opportunity to deliver influenza vaccines to school-age children. However, schools have limited resources for health-related activities. Programs are needed which provide school-based influenza vaccinations to students in order to maximize immunization coverage. In the current proposal, a study team with extensive research experience in immunization delivery will investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and cost of implementing an influenza vaccination program at 20 schools in Denver and will develop a process for billing third party payers for the services rendered. This project will capitalize on relationships being developed for a pilot project in late 2008 that will provide Tdap to eligible adolescents in eight middle schools in the Denver Public Schools (DPS) district. Using the processes developed for implementing this pilot project, we will develop the necessary strategies to implement and then evaluate a school-based influenza vaccination program in partnership with Denver Community Health Services that will vaccinate children and bill third party payers.

However, the accuracy and validity of a patient. Self-report is subject to lapses due to time and memory as well as other factors, and may not always be correct. Also, many adults obtain immunizations at a variety of venues, over many years, and through multiple providers. Many of the vaccinations, such as tetanus/diphtheria, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, and the hepatitis A and hepatitis B series, may have been administered 10-15 years before the survey is answered, thereby increasing the likelihood of inaccurate self-report. Finally, a number of patients may provide inaccurate self reports for fear of affirming risky behaviors linked to certain vaccinations. The lack of data on reporting accuracy impacts ability to interpret immunization rates resulting in potentially faulty policy decisions based on inadequate and inaccurate data. The purpose of the proposed study is to comprehensively assess the validity and accuracy of self-reported adult vaccination status in the U.S. for the nine most common adult vaccines, and in addition, describe how validity may vary by age and race/ethnicity. The proposed research will conduct 10,600 telephone interviews of patients seen at HealthPartners clinics, including both members and non-members, to obtain their immunization status for nine adult vaccinations: trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), tetanus/diphtheria (Td), pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV), hepatitis A (HepA) and hepatitis B (HepB), live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis (Tdap), Zoster (shingles) and human papillomavirus (HPV). HealthPartners clinics maintain complete and accurate vaccination histories recorded for each respondent in electronic medical records that will serve as the gold standard. We will calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, percent false positive (1-specificity), percent false negative (1- sensitivity) and net bias for self report vaccination status for each of the vaccines in each of the age and racial/ethnic subgroups, weighted to population representation. The results of this study have the potential to guide the development of future policies, resources and activities related to monitoring adult vaccination coverage in the United States.

To address this issue a population-based longitudinal burden of disease study will be implemented at two study sites in rural India. Vadu is the proposed southern Indian study site located 40 Km northeast of Pune and Ballabhgarh is the proposed northern Indian study site located 40 Km south of Delhi. Each of these sites have ongoing community and demographic surveillance systems that make them optimal locations for study implementation. The primary aim of this study is to determine the incidence of severe hospitalized and medically attended non-hospitalized influenza in each of these communities. Secondary aims include describing the spectrum and seasonality of clinical illness related to seasonal influenza, identifying risk factors for severe seasonal influenza, and describing health care utilization and the burden of respiratory disease that should seek medical care but does not, in these communities. After approvals have been obtained and the study is initiated, implementation and analysis is expected to take approximately three years.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Mental disorders are highly disabling conditions; psychiatric illness ranks second only to cardiovascular disease in its effects on disability. Despite the prevalence of some psychiatric disorders generally, we do not have a clear understanding of the prevalence and nature of treatment of psychiatric disorders for the American black population. Further the underutilization of outpatient mental health services has been well documented for ethnic minority groups. The correlates of service use and patterns of help-seeking, however, as well as risk and resiliency factors both within and across racial/ethnic groups have been identified as critical areas for future research. The National Survey of American Life (NSAL) is a comprehensive and detailed study of mental disorders and mental health of American adults and adolescents of African and Caribbean black descent. Over the past two years of the current NIMH grant, more than 70 authors from approximately a dozen national and international institutions have worked extensively on NSAL analyses and papers. This competing continuation application requests funds to extend the NSAL for four years to: 1) complete manuscripts that are currently in process; 2) respond to new lines of research raised by prior and ongoing analyses, and to conduct new analyses regarding the nature, extent, and reasons for racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence rates of mental disorders and treatment for symptoms of psychopathology. These issues will be addressed across race and ethnic groups using the NSAL, the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS); and 3) maintain and implement new training programs for scholars and students interested in using NSAL data. There are four specific aims: 1) Examine mental disorder and mental health among diverse racial/ethnic populations; 2) Investigate correlates of help-seeking behavior and services use among ethnically diverse populations; 3) Identify risk and resilience/stress and stress buffering processes that may differentially influence the psychopathology and well-being of ethnically diverse populations; and, 4) Maintain an efficient and effective training program over the four years that will meet the needs of users of NSAL, including data analysts, data managers, research assistants, and research investigators, both at Michigan and among our wide-spread group of collaborators.

To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale effectiveness study to test a collaborative care approach to treating primary care anxiety. This work builds directly on our Collaborative Care for Panic study, key informant interviews of clinicians, patients and clinic administrators, and more recent studies in primary care depression. Based on these considerations, we have developed a single, specially designed intervention called CALM (Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management), that can deliver evidence-based treatment to patients with any of four anxiety disorders prevalent in primary care (Panic Disorder [PD], Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD], Social Anxiety Disorder [SAD], and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD]), including those patients with comorbid depression and/or moderate substance abuse. This intervention allows patients treatment choice (CBT and/or medication), uses techniques to maximize patient engagement, and includes stepped care algorithms - approaches successfully employed in large-scale studies of primary care depression. We have also included an ethnically diverse study population, as well as Spanish-speaking patients, and propose qualitative studies to better understand how CALM should be tailored to individual clinics and to examine the acceptability of CALM for disadvantaged patients. These qualitative studies will provide valuable information needed for future dissemination of this approach. The primary aims are: (1) to use experimental, quantitative methods to determine the clinical effectiveness of CALM compared to treatment as usual (TAD) for the above four anxiety disorders (as a group and individually) and to compare CALM and TAU in terms of intermediate outcomes such as quality of care, self-efficacy, and social stigma; and (2) to use qualitative methods to assess acceptability and barriers to sustainability of CALM in participating clinics, providers, and patients. The secondary aims are: (1) to use quasi-experimental methods (e.g. instrumental variables) to examine the effects of appropriate treatment, independent of intervention assignment, on functioning and other clinical outcomes; and (2) to estimate health care costs and cost effectiveness of CALM.

The two original NCS-R specific aims were: to investigate time trends in the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders over the decade of the 1990s by comparing results in the results of the baseline NCS; and to expand the assessment of prevalence and correlates beyond the NCS. To these ends, the NCS-R repeated many NCS questions, updated diagnostic assessments to DSM-IV criteria (vs. DSM-III-R in the baseline NCS), expanded the number of disorders assessed, and included many new questions not in the NCS. The current application has four specific aims: (1) to disseminate and support a public use NCS-R dataset; (2) to complete analyses for the NCS-R aim of studying time trends in prevalence, treatment, treatment adequacy, and correlates compared to the baseline NCS; (3) to complete analyses for the NCS-R aim of addressing important substantive and methodological issues that were not covered in the baseline NCS; and (4) to continue our collaboration with NIMH and other colleagues in the larger U01 who are carrying out separate African-American and Latino/Asian-American surveys. The third aim is the most complex of the four, as it has six sub-aims. These include the following: (i) to estimate the prevalence, clinical severity, and correlates of individual DSM-IV disorders, expanding the number and variety of disorders assessed compared to the NCS; (ii) to evaluate disorder-specific nosological issues aimed at guiding revisions of the DSM-V system; (iii) to estimate the comparative effects of individual mental and physical disorders on role functioning and utilities; (iv) to analyze the ways in which comorbidity adds to the impairments associated with individual mental disorders; (v) to analyze the effects of mental vs. physical disorders on family burden; and (vi) to analyze the temporal unfolding of multivariate comorbid disorder profiles over the life course.

We propose to continue our multisite collaboration in order to conduct a systematic follow-up study of the children who were diagnosed with ADHD in preschool years (ages 3-5 years) and participated in the original Preschoolers with ADHD Treatment Study (PATS) to determine the safety and efficacy of methylphenidate. We estimate that of the about 300 children meeting PATS entry criteria, about 200 will be available for follow-up. The proposed follow-up study will assess these children as they turn 5-9 years of age. It will be based at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI), Duke University, Johns Hopkins University (JHU), New York University (NYU), University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and University of California at Irvine (UCI).  Aim 1 is to address whether early treatment with MPH is associated with emergence of any negative physical (decreased height and weight growth rates), cognitive, or behavioral (e.g., sleep disturbance, tics) effects. Aim 2 is to determine the continuity of dose-response relationships for methylphenidate as the child grows older, including its ability to decrease ADHD symptoms, decrease symptoms from comorbidities, and improve overall functioning. Aim 3 is to ascertain the extent to which the children's initial diagnostic and treatment status and treatment response impact on type of services received during the five-year follow-up period. Aim 4 is to determine the stability of the ADHD diagnosis and other comorbidities made for study entry at age 3-5 years across subsequent development            [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",

       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the ongoing NIMH funded multi-site study entitled \"Research Evaluating the Effect of Augmenting Medication with Psychotherapy\" (REVAMP) is to investigate psychotherapeutic strategies for treating chronic forms of major depression unresponsive to medication alone. Patients (n = 909) are treated initially with one of several pharmacologic strategies, as guided by a staged algorithm. Those who do not remit after up to 12 weeks of treatment (estimated n = 500) receive the next algorithm-guided pharmacotherapy. In addition they are randomized to Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP), Supportive Psychotherapy (SP), or Clinical Management (CM). At exit from this 12-week randomized therapy trial all consenting patients enter a 24-month naturalistic follow-up to investigate the durability of the acute approaches in keeping patients well. It is hypothesized that patients who received augmentation with CBASP in addition to switching medication will have better long-term outcomes (e.g., more time in remission, lower symptom ratings, better social adjustment) than patients receiving a medication switch alone, and patients who received SP augmentation will fall in between. We also hope to test whether the long-term effects of CBASP are mediated by teaching patients more effective social problem-solving skills. We now are submitting a competing continuation application to complete the final 3 years of the follow-up. Some prior studies have showed enduring effects of psychotherapy in depressed patients (although not in chronic forms of MOD), but other studies have failed to find such an effect, including the NIMH Collaborative Treatment Study. This follow-up study will address the important question of whether augmentation with 12 weeks of CBASP, a therapy developed specifically for chronic depression, leads to enduring effects in a chronic sample over that provided by pharmacotherapy alone or in combination with a less specific form of psychotherapy.

       " '   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This continuation application requests three-years of support to investigate differences in the correlates of psychiatric illness and mental health service disparities among Asian Americans and Latinos as compared to non-Latino Whites. We will use recently collected data from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), a national psychiatric epidemiologic study conducted to measure psychiatric disorders and mental health service usage in a representative sample of Asians and Latinos, and the National Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS-R). The combined NLAAS/NCS-R data are the best available to address critical questions regarding the level of service disparities, and the identification of service disparities \"hot spots.\" In this resubmission, we apply an innovative conceptual framework to organize correlates for psychiatric illness, mental health service use and mental health service disparities, giving attention to health system and contextual factors in addition to traditional individual level factors. Specifically, our aims are to: (1) Use combined data from the NLAAS and the NCS-R to: compare prevalence of psychiatric disorders and mental health service use among Latinos, Asian, and non-Latino Whites; investigate hypotheses related to differences in the correlates of illness and mental health services; and assess bias in disorder prevalence and service use, (2) Apply the IOM definition of disparities to quantify disparities in services utilization and identify potential mechanisms underlying services disparities, and (3) Apply methods from spatial epidemiology to identify \"hot spots\" of mental health service disparities at the MSA level, and investigate health care system factors associated with high and low performing MSAs. This study will provide national baseline data on which to define the progress and measurable targets for mental health service disparity improvements for Latinos and Asian Americans as compared to non-Latino Whites. In addition, it will identify health system factors measured at the community and individual level that mediate disparities and can be targeted by policymakers. Finally, it will provide policymakers with information regarding where in the US mental health service disparities are unusually high. These findings can be used to target resources, develop coherent public policies, and inform guidelines aimed at making mental health prevention and treatment services more responsive and sensitive to the needs of ethnic/racial minorities.

Even bright children get failing grades at school and most require a myriad of medications. Given the newness of recognizing the existence of child BP, there is as yet scant knowledge of treatment, including whether medications that have shown effectiveness in adult BP will have similar effects in children. Regarding treatment, two of the more pressing issues have been (1) which class of drug to use first (lithium, valproate, atypical neuroleptics) and (2) which drug to add-on or switch to if the first drug fails. To investigate these research questions, the TEAM project was initiated two years ago as a complex, multi-site, multi-strata, equipoise stratification, adaptive strategy design to study 540 subjects with child BP-I (manic or mixed phase), aged 6-15. In this paradigm, subjects are randomized within three strata that include Stratum One for those on no study medications. Stratum Two is an add-on strategy for those who are partial responders to one study drug. Stratum Three is a cross-taper strategy for those who have failed one study medication. Also, subjects who are partial or poor responders in Stratum One are re-randomized to the other two strata. Due to the novelty and cost of this design, NIMH requested that TEAM begin as a two year pilot, with the provison that if the two year pilot demonstrated feasibility, the investigators would be encouraged to apply for an additional four years of funding to complete the study. At the time of this writing (5/27/04 for a 6/7/04 submission date), there are 107 randomized subjects, which exceeds the planned recruitment rate. Furthermore, all three strata are being filled.

Even bright children get failing grades at school and most require a myriad of medications. Given the newness of recognizing the existence of child BP, there is as yet scant knowledge of treatment, including whether medications that have shown effectiveness in adult BP will have similar effects in children. Regarding treatment, two of the more pressing issues have been (1) which class of drug to use first (lithium, valproate, atypical neuroleptics) and (2) which drug to add-on or switch to if the first drug fails. To investigate these research questions, the TEAM project was initiated two years ago as a complex, multi-site, multi-strata, equipoise stratification, adaptive strategy design to study 540 subjects with child BP-I (manic or mixed phase), aged 6-15. In this paradigm, subjects are randomized within three strata that include Stratum One for those on no study medications. Stratum Two is an add-on strategy for those who are partial responders to one study drug. Stratum Three is a cross-taper strategy for those who have failed one study medication. Also, subjects who are partial or poor responders in Stratum One are re-randomized to the other two strata. Due to the novelty and cost of this design, NIMH requested that TEAM begin as a two year pilot, with the proviso that if the two year pilot demonstrated feasibility, the investigators would be encouraged to apply for an additional four years of funding to complete the study. At the time of this writing (5/27/04 for a 6/7/04 submission date), there are 107 randomized subjects, which exceeds the planned recruitment rate. Furthermore, all three strata are being filled. Therefore, feasibility has been established. As a large cooperative agreement, this study is monitored on a quarterly basis by the NIMH Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). At the five DSMB audits conducted at the time of this writing, TEAM has received outstanding praise for data management, quality control, and safety. The structure of this cooperative agreement is one coordinating site (Washington U in St. Louis, PI: B. Geller) and five data collection sites (Children's National Medical Center, PI: P. Joshi; Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, PI: J. Walkup; U Pittsburgh, PI: D. Axelson; UT Medical Branch, Galveston, PI: K. Dineen Wagner; Washington U in St. Louis, PI: J. Luby).

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a Phase III, community-level, randomized controlled study, in which 48 communities (10 in Tanzania, 8 in Zimbabwe, 8 in South Africa-Soweto, 8 in South Africa-Vulindlela, and 14 in Thailand) were randomized to receive either a community-based HIV voluntary counseling and testing (CBVCT) intervention or standard clinic-based VCT (SVCT). The CBVCT intervention has three major strategies: (1) to make VCT more available in community settings; (2) to engage the community through outreach; and (3) to provide post-test support. These three strategies are designed to change community norms and reduce risk for HIV infection among all community members, irrespective of whether they participated directly in the intervention. The primary objective (Aim 1) of this study is to test the hypothesis that communities receiving 2-1/2 years of CBVCT, relative to communities receiving 2-1/2 years of SVCT, will have significantly lower prevalence of recent HIV infection. The secondary objective (Aim 2) is to test the hypotheses that CBVCT communities, relative to SVCT communities, will at the end of the intervention period report significantly: less HIV risk behavior, higher rates of HIV testing, more favorable social norms regarding HIV testing, more frequent discussions about HIV, more frequent disclosure of HIV status, less HIV-related stigma, and fewer HIV- related negative life events. Aim 3 of the study will be to assess whether CBVCT is cost-effective compared to SVCT. A random sample of persons aged 16 to 32 from each study community was selected at baseline, and will be selected post intervention, for measuring primary and secondary endpoints. Aim 1 will be evaluated by comparing the post-intervention prevalence of recent HIV infection in CBVCT and SVCT communities, using an algorithmic approach comprised of CD4+ T-cell counts, the HIV-1 BED Incidence EIA (Calypte), Avidity Index (BioRad), and HPLC for ART residues (HPTN Core Lab/JHU). Aim 2 will be evaluated by comparing a variety of behavioral measures at baseline and post intervention. Aim 3 will be evaluated in terms of cost per HIV infection averted and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) saved.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

A total of 1600 African American adolescents, ages 12-16, will be recruited through CBOs in 4 cities, two in the Northeast (Providence and Syracuse) and two in the Southeast (Columbia and Macon), to participate in this HIV/STD prevention trial.  Adolescents will complete a baseline ACASI administered survey to assess their attitudes, beliefs and sexual behaviors, and provide a urine specimen for detection of three prevalent STDs.  Following baseline assessment, all adolescents will be randomly assigned to receive either the Focus on Kids HIV-prevention intervention or a General Health Promotion control. Subsequently, adolescents will be followed longitudinally and complete similar assessments at 6-, 12- and 18-months follow-up.  The second level of intervention involves tailored HIV/STD prevention messages through local mass media.  One city in each regional city-pair will be randomly assigned to receive the HIV prevention media campaign while the other city will serve as a control city (no media campaign).  Thus, the media messages will be directed to African American youth in only one of the two cities in each geographic region. The media program will deliver HIV-prevention messages that are culturally sensitive and age appropriate; these programs will promote both abstinence and risk reduction practices.  Cross-sectional surveys of 1200 African American youth using random-digit-dialing telephone interviews in the two cities that receive the media campaign and the two media control cities will be conducted over a 30-month period to determine the community-wide effects of the HIV media campaign.  This design will enable a test of the joint and separate effects of the two interventions over an 18-month follow-up for the youth participating in the small-group interventions.  In addition, the media campaign is predicted to independently enhance adolescents' adoption of HIV-preventive attitudes, beliefs and behaviors on a community-wide basis compared to youth in the non-media control cities.  Causal modeling methodology will be employed to assess the effects of the two levels of intervention and to identify the role of supportive messages received through the media and from peers that are predicted to maintain safer sexual behavior as adolescents mature.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Elders with bipolar disorders (BP) have severe and debilitating psychopathology, poor treatment outcomes, and high medical morbidity and mortality. Controlled treatment studies for late-life BP disorder are lacking, and findings in young patients may not be relevant because aging-related changes may reduce the tolerability and efficacy of treatments. Improving the treatment of late-life BP disorder was identified as a priority at the NIMH-DBPA Consensus Conference (2001). In response, we propose the first randomized, double-blind, controlled comparison of lithium (LI) and divalproex (DV) in elders with BP-I manic, mixed and hypomanic episodes, designed to test differences in side effects and benefits under dosing conditions relevant to geriatric practice. Hospitalized and ambulatory patients (n=306) aged 60 years and older will be studied for 9 weeks. Participants will be randomized to LI (0.4-0.99 mEq/L; target 0.80-0.99 mEq/L) or DV (valproate 40-99 meg/ml; target 80-99 meg/ml), and will be treated with monotherapy in the first three weeks at maximum tolerated concentrations. Patients with unsatisfactory response after three weeks will receive adjunctive olanzapine. The tolerability measures will be side effect ratings and the proportion treated at target concentrations. The efficacy measures will be improvement in mood symptoms and in function and quality of life. Data obtained for testing the primary hypotheses will allow secondary analyses of selected factors which may modify outcomes. Compatibility of selected measures with those of the STEP-BD study of younger patients will enhance the value of findings from this study. Recognizing the difficulties inherent in a randomized study of BP elders, we brought together six groups (Cornell, Baylor College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve, Duke, and Universities of Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh) with research expertise in late-life and young adult BP disorders, and with strong research infrastructure and clinical resources. The sites have a history of successful collaborative research, including demanding geriatric studies.      [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

Participants will be randomized to LI (0.4-0.99 mEq/L; target 0.80-0.99 mEq/L) or DV (valproate 40-99 meg/ml; target 80-99 meg/ml), and will be treated with monotherapy in the first three weeks at maximum tolerated concentrations. Patients with unsatisfactory response after three weeks will receive adjunctive olanzapine. The tolerability measures will be side effect ratings and the proportion treated at target concentrations. The efficacy measures will be improvement in mood symptoms and in function and quality of life. Data obtained for testing the primary hypotheses will allow secondary analyses of selected factors which may modify outcomes. Compatibility of selected measures with those of the STEP-BD study of younger patients will enhance the value of findings from this study.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Continuous treatment with antipsychotic medications is the foundation on which all other interventions for schizophrenia rest. Nonadherence with medication has repeatedly been shown to increase the frequency and severity of relapse in schizophrenia, nevertheless there is evidence that a substantial portion of patients relapse during continuous treatment with long-acting injectable antipsychotics. Relapse in schizophrenia may have devastating effects over and above the uncontrolled psychosis, including distress for family and caregivers, harmful or suicidal behaviors, rehospitalization, and functional deterioration with loss of independence. Its public health significance is undeniable, and there is a compelling need to identify vulnerabilities to relapse. Preliminary data has shown an association between genetic variation and rapid relapse in schizophrenia and there is a growing literature showing that genetic variation affects outcome with antipsychotic treatment. The recently funded NIMH multi-center relapse prevention trial \"Relapse Prevention: Long Acting Atypical Antipsychotics\" provides a timely platform for examining the pharmacogenetics of relapse over an extended period of time. We propose to examine whether genetic variations can predict which patients are at highest risk for psychotic relapse during antipsychotic treatment. Blood samples will provide DNA to detect variations in genes that code for a serotonin transporter, dopamine receptors, and P-glycoprotein transporter (transports lipophilic medications including antipsychotics into the CMS) in 304 patients, who will have comprehensive evaluations of relapse, symptoms, functionality, and tolerability over two and a half years of treatment with long-acting risperidone injections or oral second generation antipsychotics (SGAs). Our primary hypothesis is that genetic differences in the serotonin transporter, dopamine receptors and/or Pglycoprotein transporter will be associated with the likelihood of relapse during long-term antipsychotic therapy. If there are differences in efficacy to prevent relapse between the treatment groups, we will adjust for these differences in the final genetic analyses. This pharmacogenetics study will advance our ability to detect the role that genetics play in relapse and provide important new data to inform the clinical use of SGAs in the long-term treatment of schizophrenia. An understanding of the genetic factors involved in relapse may allow clinicians to identify patients who are at a high risk for relapse and modify their treatment plan accordingly, which may significantly reduce the public health burden of schizophrenia.

Its public health significance is indisputable, with now compelling need to understand the neurobiology and treatment of relapse. Antipsychotic medications reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, with postulated mechanisms including sustained cortical integrity, neurogenesis, and arrest of apoptosis. Recent preclinical - clinical studies now point to the importance of brain neurotrophins, ubiquitous agents, which play key roles in neuronal integrity/survival, in promoting synaptic plasticity, and serve as neurotransmitter modulators across monoaminergic (dopamine - serotonin), gabaergic, and cholinergic systems ... all areas of fundamental interest in schizophrenia research. Short-term translational studies point to changes in neurotrophins upon in schizophrenia and, more extensively studied, in relapse during mood disorders. Accordingly, the long term course and clinical import of alterations in neurotrophins in schizophrenia is now timely for systematic and extended study. The recently funded NIMH multicenter relapse prevention trial PROACTIVE now also provides a timely platform for complementary translational research in this supplemental application to evaluate the neurobiological significance of neurotrophins on relapse. Blood will be collected to determine plasma levels (previously shown to reflect brain concentration) of the neurotrophins - Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Nerve Growth Factor - at baseline and at frequent intervals (including time of relapse) in over three hundred patients, with comprehensive evaluations over two and a half years of symptoms, functionality, relapse, and medication tolerability. This study has significance and innovation and it could advance understanding of the translational neurobiology of relapse in schizophrenia.  [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",

To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale effectiveness study to test a collaborative care approach to treating primary care anxiety. This work builds directly on our Collaborative Care for Panic study, key informant interviews of clinicians, patients and clinic administrators, and more recent studies in primary care depression. Based on these considerations, we have developed a single, specially designed intervention called CALM (Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management), that can deliver evidence-based treatment to patients with any of four anxiety disorders prevalent in primary care (Panic Disorder [PD], Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD], Social Anxiety Disorder [SAD], and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD]), including those patients with comorbid depression and/or moderate substance abuse. This intervention allows patients treatment choice (CBT and/or medication), uses techniques to maximize patient engagement, and includes stepped care algorithms - approaches successfully employed in large-scale studies of primary care depression. We have also included an ethnically diverse study population, as well as Spanish-speaking patients, and propose qualitative studies to better understand how CALM should be tailored to individual clinics and to examine the acceptability of CALM for disadvantaged patients. These qualitative studies will provide valuable information needed for future dissemination of this approach. The primary aims are: (1) to use experimental, quantitative methods to determine the clinical effectiveness of CALM compared to treatment as usual (TAD) for the above four anxiety disorders (as a group and individually) and to compare CALM and TAU in terms of intermediate outcomes such as quality of care, self-efficacy, and social stigma; and (2) to use qualitative methods to assess acceptability and barriers to sustainability of CALM in participating clinics, providers, and patients. The secondary aims are: (1) to use quasi-experimental methods (e.g. instrumental variables) to examine the effects of appropriate treatment, independent of intervention assignment, on functioning and other clinical outcomes; and (2) to estimate health care costs and cost effectiveness of CALM.

Improving term medication adherence prevents relapse and may improve other outcomes. Until now, the only long-acting psychotic medications were high potency, first-generation antipsychotics that carry a significant side effect burden are perceived as the treatment of choice only for patients with documented histories of non-compliance and relapse second-generation anti-psychotic, risperidone, will soon be available in a long-acting injectable formulation, risperidone microspheres.  We propose an eight-site randomized, open label trial to compare its effectiveness to second-generation oral anti-psychotics.  Over the 5 year study period, 304 in- and out-patients will be randomized, treated for up 30 months and assessed by both remotely located, and local independent masked assessors in a number of critical domain. Details of the study rationale and methodology are provided in the individual site applications. The coordinating team will be led by John M. Kane, MD and includes Stephen R, Marder, MD and Nina R. Schooler, PhD, a group  with extensive expertise in directing long-term clinical trials of schizophrenia.  Each has led major studies of the older depot anti-psychotics, and they have collaborated successfully on multi-site studies. They will direct the fine-tuning of study design, oversee and coordinate recruitment, staff training, monitoring of rater-reliability and data quality at all sites. They will oversee data management, statistical analysis and reporting of results.  A DSMB will be supported by grant. The coordination model includes conference calls to insure that specific groups, e.g. project coordinators, interact regularly. Face to face meetings of research teams will also be employed.  A detailed study manual and site visits by coordinating team members will enhance cross-site consistency in protocol implementation. The site P.I.s represent talent and expertise, but none of them bas ever led a study of this scope. Participation in this study under the guidance the coordinating team will position them to lead future multi-site research in a field that sorely needs experienced investigators.  Generalizability will be enhanced by the randomized but open-label design, which mirrors actual treatment more closely than does a double-blind design.  The study is timely; the broadest population for study will be available when risperidone microspheres first comes to the market. Once clinicians have begun to prescribe this medication, patients who have received it will be excluded from the study and generalizability will decline.  The study addresses questions that are unlikely to be studied by pharmaceutical industry sponsors and will generate unique information regarding long-term treatment options for schizophrenia.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Elders with bipolar disorders (BP) have severe and debilitating psychopathology, poor treatment outcomes, and high medical morbidity and mortality. Controlled treatment studies for late-life BP disorder are lacking, and findings in young patients may not be relevant because aging-related changes may reduce the tolerability and efficacy of treatments. Improving the treatment of late-life BP disorder was identified as a priority at the NIMH-DBPA Consensus Conference (2001). In response, we propose the first randomized, double-blind, controlled comparison of lithium (LI) and divalproex (DV) in elders with BP-I manic, mixed and hypomanic episodes, designed to test differences in side effects and benefits under dosing conditions relevant to geriatric practice. Hospitalized and ambulatory patients (n=306) aged 60 years and older will be studied for 9 weeks. Participants will be randomized to LI (0.4-0.99 mEq/L; target 0.80-0.99 mEq/L) or DV (valproate 40-99 meg/ml; target 80-99 meg/ml), and will be treated with monotherapy in the first three weeks at maximum tolerated concentrations. Patients with unsatisfactory response after three weeks will receive adjunctive olanzapine. The tolerability measures will be side effect ratings and the proportion treated at target concentrations. The efficacy measures will be improvement in mood symptoms and in function and quality of life. Data obtained for testing the primary hypotheses will allow secondary analyses of selected factors which may modify outcomes. Compatibility of selected measures with those of the STEP-BD study of younger patients will enhance the value of findings from this study.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Elders with bipolar disorders (BP) have severe and debilitating psychopathology, poor treatment outcomes, and high medical morbidity and mortality. Controlled treatment studies for late-life BP disorder are lacking, and findings in young patients may not be relevant because aging-related changes may reduce the tolerability and efficacy of treatments. Improving the treatment of late-life BP disorder was identified as a priority at the NIMH-DBPA Consensus Conference (2001). In response, we propose the first randomized, double-blind, controlled comparison of lithium (LI) and divalproex (DV) in elders with BP-I manic, mixed and hypomanic episodes, designed to test differences in side effects and benefits under dosing conditions relevant to geriatric practice. Hospitalized and ambulatory patients (n=306) aged 60 years and older will be studied for 9 weeks. Participants will be randomized to LI (0.4-0.99 mEq/L; target 0.80-0.99 mEq/L) or DV (valproate 40-99 meg/ml; target 80-99 meg/ml), and will be treated with monotherapy in the first three weeks at maximum tolerated concentrations. Patients with unsatisfactory response after three weeks will receive adjunctive olanzapine. The tolerability measures will be side effect ratings and the proportion treated at target concentrations. The efficacy measures will be improvement in mood symptoms and in function and quality of life. Data obtained for testing the primary hypotheses will allow secondary analyses of selected factors which may modify outcomes. Compatibility of selected measures with those of the STEP-BD study of younger patients will enhance the value of findings from this study. Recognizing the difficulties inherent in a randomized study of BP elders, we brought together six groups (Cornell, Baylor College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve, Duke, and Universities of Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh) with research expertise in late-life and young adult BP disorders, and with strong research infrastructure and clinical resources.

       " '   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM (provided by applicant):  Persistent negative and cognitive symptoms are a primary cause of chronic disability and poor long-term outcome in schizophrenia. Phencylidine (PCP) and other antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated neurotransmission induce symptoms and cognitive deficits that closely resemble those of schizophrenia, indicating a potentially critical role of NMDA receptors in the etiopathology of primary negative symptoms. NMDA receptors are modulated in vivo by glycine and D-serine, which bind to a modulatory site of the NMDA receptor complex. Clinical trials with NMDA/glycine site agonists have yielded highly encouraging clinical data. This CDDG application will focus on development of D-serine as an effective treatment for persistent negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, in collaboration with Rexim Corporation, a major manufacturer of D-serine and other amino acids for the pharmaceutical industry. The application consists of two projects. Project 1 will consist of PK/PD, dose-finding and subsequent double-blind treatment studies at NKI involving patients, with chronic schizophrenia, and investigating D-serine effects on persistent negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. Project 2 will consist of a collaborative multicenter trial of D-serine treatment of the schizophrenia prodrome to be conducted at Yale University and Zucker Hillside Hospital. Together these projects will validate treatment targets for NMDA agonists in general and D-serine in particular and will encourage continued clinical development.       ',\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application seeks funding for the (Cornell) Study Coordinating Center (SCC) of a multi-site study of treatment of elders with bipolar disorders (BP). Research in this population has been hampered by the limited numbers of patients at single academic sites, the challenging nature and complexity of these patients, and the need for research skills both in  [unreadable] geriatrics and in acute treatment studies of BP patients. The coordination of a multi-center study of BP elders, therefore, poses special challenges beyond those that are common to multicenter studies in other populations. To overcome these challenges, we have assembled a group of academic sites and investigators with a history of successful collaboration on multicenter studies, including geriatric intervention studies and studies of BP disorder, and developed a coordinating structure based on the Cornell ACISR experience in leading multicenter studies. The SCC Administrative Component is designed to provide monitoring of the conduct of the study, timely correction of problems, and a forum for scientific discourse regarding ideas and data originating from the study. The SCC Assessment Component will rely on Dr.m Young's (PI) experience in mania assessment, Cornell's experience in staff training derived from PROSPECT and other multicenter studies, Dr. Schulberg's leadership in coordinating multicenter studies, and the neuropsychology expertise of Dr. Gur and the U. of Pennsylvania Brain Biology Laboratory. The SCC Treatment Component will use procedures of research protocol implementation and monotoring similar to those of other multicenter studies led by Cornell ACISR, and will work together with the University of Pittsburgh Research Pharmacy. The Data Management component will rely on Dr. Bruce's and her staffs experience in use of computer assisted patient interviewing (CAPI). Dr. TenHave and the Biostatistics Core staff will provide state-of-the art  [unreadable] approaches to the analysis of multicenter study data. The SCC organization uses the experience, clinical resources, and strong research infrastructure at the collaborating sites. It, therefore, is strongly positioned for the successful conduct of this first study of its kind.      [unreadable] [unreadable] \",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to evaluate the role of comorbid depression as a moderator of the clinical effectiveness and costs of Medicare's new Voluntary Chronic Care Improvement Program (CCIP), and to assess the value added of managing comorbid depression in this program. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 created the CCIP to manage care for Medicare beneficiaries with significant chronic illness. In its initial phase, the CCIP will implement three-year pilot programs in ten sites, targeting Medicare beneficiaries with congestive heart failure, complex diabetes, and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The pilot programs will be implemented as randomized control trials and will cover 15,000-30,000 beneficiaries per site. At the time of this writing, CMS is selecting organizations to provide CCIP services; patient enrollment begins in 2005.  The CCIP is the first large-scale disease management initiative under the Medicare FFS program. It is also the largest-ever disease management trial for patients with comorbid depression, which is particularly prevalent (15%-25%) in the CCIP's target population. Chronically ill patients with comorbid depression have more severe medical illness, worse clinical outcomes, and higher health care costs than those without - which make them important potential targets for disease management. At the same time, patients with comorbid depression are harder to treat with conventional disease management programs that don't address depression, due to lower adherence to self-care (e.g., diet, exercise, smoking cessation) and medical regimens. This is likely to raise the costs and/or lower the benefits of disease management interventions for such patients, relative to patients with the same medical conditions but without comorbid depression. These patterns suggest that there may be considerable clinical and economic benefits from including specific strategies to address comorbid depression in disease management programs for chronic medical illness. We propose to investigate this by working with CMS to facilitate the integration of evidence-based depression management in the CCIP, and by analyzing patient- and organization-level data from the initial phase of the CCIP. Our findings will help CMS strengthen the CCIP and will help public and private policymakers implement effective disease management programs for chronic medical illness and comorbid depression.\",\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Approximately 3-5% of children ages 3-17 in the U.S.  are diagnosed with Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and 4 million children are medicated chronically to treat ADHD. Methylphenidate (MPD) and amphetamine (Amph), control ADHD in the majority of those treated. However, there are concerns over long-lasting developmental changes in behavior, neurochemistry, growth rates and potential for substance abuse in children treated with MPD or Amph. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that chronic MPD or Amph results in long-term behavioral, physiologic and neurochemical alterations in preadolescent rhesus monkeys. Oral self-dosing techniques will provide non-stressful administration of MPD or Amph in doses within the therapeutic window for treatment of ADHD in children. Specific Aim 1 will determine if chronic MPD or Amph alters physiological development of preadolescent monkeys including circadian rhythms, body weights, food intake, and body growth rate. After 18 months of MPD or Amph administration, tests for behavioral sensitization to amphetamine will also be performed. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that chronic MPD or Amph alters the developing central nervous system including chronic activation of microglia and long-lasting alterations in dopaminergic function in preadolescent monkeys. Measures of dopaminergic function will include levels of dopamine transporters, dopamine D2 receptors and amphetamine-stimulated dopamine release. Specific Aim 3 will determine the effects of chronic MPD or Amph on development of executive function including inhibitory control and attentional set-shifting. Specific Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that monkeys previously exposed to MPD or Amph have a higher propensity to self-administer cocaine. The proposed studies provide a comprehensive interdisciplinary evaluation of the chronic effects of therapeutic doses of MPD and Amph in preadolescent nonhuman primates. These studies will advance understanding of the long-term neurochemical, behavioral and physiologic effects of chronic low-dose stimulant treatments and have direct translational application to the medication of children with ADHD.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) remains a significant public health problem. Despite aggressive conventional treatment, suffering and functional impairment may continue, degrading quality of life. Our three collaborative pilot studies suggest that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral anterior limb of internal capsule and adjacent ventral striatum (VC/VS) is effective in otherwise resistant OCD. The devices (made by Medtronic, Inc.) are uniquely FDA-approved for brain stimulation, with proven efficacy and safety in Parkinson disease, tremor, and dystonia. In seven years of pilot OCD work, the brain target has been refined and effective DBS parameters identified. We propose a more definitive controlled trial. This collaborative, five-year study involves the three U.S. sites most experienced in DBS for OCD, including the NIMH pilot trial site. Forty-five patients will enroll in a randomized, parallel, controlled design. We will use well-established procedures to determine if patients are resistant to medication and behavior therapies. Independent assessments of diagnosis, treatment history, and the consent process will be required for enrollment. Patients will enroll, 11-12/year, over the first four years. We will compare masked active to sham stimulation over three months to obtain primary efficacy and safety data. The criterion for DBS response will be categorical and strict: improvement in both symptoms (a 35% Yale-Brown Obsessive- Compulsive Scale score reduction) and in global functioning. After the three-month controlled phase, open DBS will continue for 1-4 years to obtain long-term effectiveness and safety data. Positron emission tomography at baseline will be used to obtain brain metabolic predictors of response. A repeat scan after at least three months of stimulation will test the hypothesis that activity in corticobasal networks implicated in OCD will change after DBS. If successful, reversible DBS will offer hope to severely affected people with few treatment options. The imaging data will provide unique insight into brain networks predicting and mediating the response to DBS for intractable OCD.   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objective of this proposal is to enhance the treatment and outcome of anorexia nervosa (AN) and to develop a network of research and training centers to support innovative research in AN. Research on the treatment of AN has lagged that of other conditions, even other eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa, hence it is important to test potentially effective treatments in a large scale study so as to provide a baseline for future studies. The focus of this proposal is on adolescent AN. Successful early treatment is likely to reduce the prevalence of chronic AN with its high rates of morbidity and mortality and high health care costs. The most promising treatment for adolescent AN is a specific form of family therapy, (the Maudsley approach) called here, behavioral family therapy (BFT). This treatment is focused on the disordered eating behavior that characterizes AN and enables parents to refeed their child. Additionally, there is preliminary evidence that fluoxetine may be useful in reducing comorbid psychopathology and enhancing maintenance in AN. However, there has been no placebo controlled study of fluoxetine in adolescent AN. Moreover, although there have been several small-scale studies of BFT there has been no controlled comparison with another form of family therapy. Hence, we propose to use systems family therapy (SFT) which has been developed and manualized to represent the type of family therapy practiced in the community. We propose to randomly allocate 240 adolescents aged 12-18 years with AN and their families to one of 4 groups: BFT + placebo; BFT + fluoxetine; SFT + placebo; and SFT + fluoxetine. Medication will be continued for 6-months beyond the end of family therapy to assess medication effects on the maintenance of therapeutic gains. Treatment and assessment will be carried out at 6 clinical sites with 40 subjects per site with separate data and coordinating centers. The treatment sites will follow common assessment and treatment protocols with detailed monitoring of recruitment, treatment, assessment and human subjects procedures by the coordinating center. The results of this study should provide guidance to clinicians concerning optimal treatment approaches for adolescent AN. From the public health perspective, development of effective treatments for adolescents will reduce the morbidity, mortality, and high costs associated with chronic AN.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term aim of this project is to translate genetic discoveries in humans with disorders of brain development into effective treatments for humans with these disorders. Human genetic studies have revealed that a common form of mental retardation known as fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a consequence of mutations in a single gene, FMR1, which prevents expression of a single protein (FMRP). Brain developmental in the absence of FMRP is associated with significant morbidity including impaired cognitive function, attention deficit and hyperactivity, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and autistic behaviors. There are no effective treatments for fragile X syndrome. Understanding the effects of the fragile X mutation on brain development and function has been facilitated by generation of genetically engineered animals that model fragile X syndrome. The accumulated scientific evidence in these animal models over the last decade suggests that the symptoms of fragile X reflect excessive protein synthesis downstream of mGluR5, a metabotropic glutamate receptor. Genetic knockdown of mGluR5 expression can rescue multiple phenotypes in Fmr1 knockout mice. Moreover, acute and chronic treatment of fragile X mouse and fly models with mGluR5 antagonists in vivo has protected mutant animals from seizures, impaired cognitive function, and altered brain development. Thus, the evidence clearly indicates that mGluR5 is a valid target for development of drugs to treat fragile X. The aim of our proposal is to advance an mGluR5 antagonist licensed from Merck into human clinical trials. Seaside Therapeutics has licensed from Merck several highly selective, potent and orally available mGluR5 antagonists and we intend to develop the lead compound, STX107, to treat FXS and, potentially autism. We request in this grant the funds needed to translate these compelling basic science discoveries into clinical research with the goal of providing meaningful treatments for FXS and other disorders of brain development. We will accomplish this by advancing our lead compound, STX107, through the preclinical studies necessary to fulfill FDA requirements to open an Investigational New Drug application and perform initial testing in humans. These studies provide the foundation that will allow us to test our hypothesis that mGluR5 antagonists can be an effective treatment of FXS and other disorders of brain development including autism. Relevance: Our research suggests for the first time a sound scientific rationale for pharmacologic treatment of fragile X syndrome and, potentially, other disorders of brain development such as autism.

Human genetic studies have revealed that a common form of mental retardation known as fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a consequence of mutations in a single gene, FMR1, which prevents expression of a single protein (FMRP). Brain developmental in the absence of FMRP is associated with significant morbidity including impaired cognitive function, attention deficit and hyperactivity, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and autistic behaviors. There are no effective treatments for fragile X syndrome. Understanding the effects of the fragile X mutation on brain development and function has been facilitated by generation of genetically engineered animals that model fragile X syndrome. The accumulated scientific evidence in these animal models over the last decade suggests that the symptoms of fragile X reflect excessive protein synthesis downstream of mGluR5, a metabotropic glutamate receptor. Genetic knockdown of mGluR5 expression can rescue multiple phenotypes in Fmr1 knockout mice. Moreover, acute and chronic treatment of fragile X mouse and fly models with mGluR5 antagonists in vivo has protected mutant animals from seizures, impaired cognitive function, and altered brain development. Thus, the evidence clearly indicates that mGluR5 is a valid target for development of drugs to treat fragile X. The aim of our proposal is to advance an mGluR5 antagonist licensed from Merck into human clinical trials. Seaside Therapeutics has licensed from Merck several highly selective, potent and orally available mGluR5 antagonists and we intend to develop the lead compound, STX107, to treat FXS and, potentially autism. We request in this grant the funds needed to translate these compelling basic science discoveries into clinical research with the goal of providing meaningful treatments for FXS and other disorders of brain development. We will accomplish this by advancing our lead compound, STX107, through the preclinical studies necessary to fulfill FDA requirements to open an Investigational New Drug application and perform initial testing in humans. These studies provide the foundation that will allow us to test our hypothesis that mGluR5 antagonists can be an effective treatment of FXS and other disorders of brain development including autism. Relevance: Our research suggests for the first time a sound scientific rationale for pharmacologic treatment of fragile X syndrome and, potentially, other disorders of brain development such as autism.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intro: An FDA re-analysis of pediatric clinical trials (N about 4400) in psychiatric conditions found that the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) was significantly higher with antidepressants (4%) compared to placebo (2%). These data revealed that the suicidality signal was not limited to depression: subjects with OCD and other anxiety disorders also exhibited this higher risk. Although the mechanism responsible for this effect is unknown, induction of an \"activation syndrome\" (e.g., irritability, restlessness, emotional lability, etc.) may represent an intermediary state change that promotes suicidality. SSRI-induced activation syndrome is well-accepted by clinicians and thought to be common, particularly in children and teens. However, there is a dearth of empirical data on the phenomenology and quantification of this putative syndrome. We conceptualize activation syndrome as behavioral toxicity (an adverse event) that occurs relatively independent of the underlying diagnosis, while acknowledging that various factors may modify susceptibility and expression (e.g., age, dosing, pharmacogenetics, comorbidity, etc.). Better characterization of activation syndrome and its timing might point to the mechanisms mediating this adverse effect as well as approaches to its mitigation. Specific Aims are: 1. To formalize and quantify a cluster of behavioral side effects of SSRIs, referred to as \"activation syndrome\" and 2. To confirm the occurrence and timing of activation syndrome during SSRI treatment. Approach: The first phase will entail an iterative process of arriving at consensus on the content domains corresponding to activation syndrome, selection and revision of measures, creation of a composite measure and testing of reliability in a representative sample of children and adolescents at various stages of treatment with SSRIs. In the second phase, children and adolescents with OCD will be randomized in double-blind fashion to either 1) sertraline at standard dosing (RegSert); 2) sertraline slow titration (SloSert); or 3) pill placebo (Pla) for 18 weeks. All groups will receive CBT for their OC symptoms starting after week 4. We predict that measures of activation syndrome will be elevated early (first days or 2 weeks) during RegSert compared to PLA. We will explore if SloSert reduces frequency or intensity of activation syndrome compared to RegSert. Conducting this study in OCD offers pragmatic advantages (e.g., clarity of diagnosis), yet findings should be generalizable to other diagnostic groups. Significance: SSRIs induce an activation syndrome (consisting of irritability, agitation, mood swings, etc.) that may be a precursor to suicidality in some individuals. Improved recognition and understanding of activation syndrome should prompt interventions (e.g., slower dosing of antidepressants) that might reduce the risk of developing suicidality. Development of an activation syndrome measurement tool will be useful in future large-scale clinical trials that test the relationship between activation syndrome and suicidality.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In October 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an advisory that antidepressants may be associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children and adolescents. These warnings were prompted by its meta-analysis of all available randomized trials of antidepressants in this age group, in which patients randomized to antidepressants had nearly twice the rate of suicidal ideation or behavior relative to those given placebo. However, following the warnings clinicians, policymakers, and patients still need guidance on important treatment questions. We propose pooling 3 large cohorts of patients who initiated antidepressant therapy (Medicaid <65; Medicare 65+, and a province-wide population-based cohort in British Columbia) and link that use to data on their health care utilization. We will employ several innovative analytic methods to produce data that will help guide treatment choices. Specifically, we will answer the following research questions: 1) Identify the rates of suicidality in users of antidepressants in terms of class, specific agents, dosages, and durations of use. 2) Identify sociodemographic, clinical, and concomitant treatment factors that may modify the relationship between antidepressant use and suicidality. 3) Identify the impact of FDA actions on antidepressant utilization and clinical outcomes. 4) Identify patterns and potentially modifiable determinants of patient monitoring after initiation of therapy to help design and target future risk management interventions. 5) Assess and improve the accuracy of coding attempted suicide in hospital and emergency room admissions. This large pharmacoepidemiologic study by an experienced interdisciplinary team using multiple analytic methods will assess the most critical issues surrounding the safety of antidepressant therapy, and will provide guidance to develop and target better prescribing and risk management strategies.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): A major goal in neurobiology is identifying functional neuronal pathways. Classical anatomical tracing techniques allow connectivity between brain regions to be determined. Lesion studies and anatomically restricted infusion of pharmacological agents have helped to identify the functional role of these brain regions at a gross level. The development of techniques for the genetic manipulation of the mouse during the past 15 years has greatly expanded our ability to probe the molecular mechanisms of biological function in a mammalian model system. However, one of the difficulties in the application of the genetic approach to the nervous system is the relative lack of ability to map molecular genetic changes onto the complex neuroanatomy of the brain. The goal of the current application is to develop a series of 48 driver lines for the generation of anatomically restricted and inducible gene knock-outs. For greatest genetic utility to the neuroscience community the strains will be developed on a pure C57BL/6 background. The most widely used tools for anatomically restricted and time dependent manipulation of gene function in the mouse are the CRE-recombinase and the tTA-transactivator, respectively, but very few driver lines are available to the neuroscience community. Furthermore, most CRE-driver lines do not allow strict temporal control, such as the ability to knock-out genes in adult tissues. We plan to use transgenic approaches to express CRE and tTA driven by the regulatory elements of 24 chosen genes. The default approach is targeting via homologous recombination in ES cells; vectors for pronuclear injections (including BACs) will also be utilized. The driver lines will allow us to achieve temporal and spatial control of recombinase activity in disparate regions of the nervous system. Driver lines will be validated by monitoring cell type and time dependent CRE activity. Behavioral studies will ensure that the transgenes do not affect neuronal function. The choice of the 24 driver loci represents the expertise of the four investigators involved in this application and are of relevance for the neuroscience community, covering sensory biology and pain, CMS and stem cell development, the limbic system, and learning and memory. From a clinical perspective the lines generated should be particularly relevant to the study of Neuropsychiatric disorders and addiction (eg. targeting the dopamine system) and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. targeting the limbic system and adult stem cells).

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): The limited availability of Cre driver lines in the mouse for manipulating the expression of genes in the dimensions of both time and space has severely hampered biomedical research progress. These lines are required for investigators to be able to perform gene overexpression, gene misexpression, and genesilencing experiments in the normal mouse as well as gene-rescue experiments in mutant organisms. Although defined regulatory elements of some genes could, in principle, be used to drive Cre expression with control over the spatial dimension, the regulatory elements that are used to express native genes are numerous, complex, and difficult to dissect into individual elements. In addition, there are very few genes that are expressed in the mouse brain in a very limited spatial domain, such that classical knock in approaches are not anticipated to provide precise spatial specificity on expression. An alternative strategy developed by investigators working with other model organisms, particularly Drosophila, is enhancer trapping. In this strategy, a DMA segment carrying a minimal promoter that can promote the expression of a gene of interest is integrated into the genome at random in transgenic animals, so that any random integrant usurps the activity of a nearby enhancer and this causes the gene of interest to be expressed in time and space according to the determinants of the nearby enhancer. Such strategies have populated the Drosophila research field with thousands of enhancer trap lines that express Gal4 or inducible Gal4 derivatives in virtually any tissue and cell type of the organism and these reagents are the basis for uncountable discoveries. We propose here, a similar strategy in the mouse. We will construct and validate over the next 5 years more than 2500 new enhancer trap lines in the mouse that carry inducible forms of Cre. We anticipate that between 1 and 5 percent of these lines will show specific Cre expression in the brain in both time and space. The project will be performed at the Baylor College of Medicine, known for its emphasis on and excellence in mouse genetics. The project will include investigators that have developed new and inducible enhancer trap vectors in Drosophila and used these to perform large screens for brain expression patterns, outstanding molecular biologists to construct new enhancer trap vectors carrying inducible versions of Cre, mouse geneticists that have led in the construction of hundreds of new mouse transgenic/knock-out models, and experts in the histological analysis of gene expression in the mouse brain using high-throughput, robotically-based workstations for RNA in situ hybridization and other types of histological procedures. The efficiency of obtaining new Cre driver lines offering experimenter control over expression and time and space will be much greater using the random enhancer trapping-based approach compared to strategies for first defining appropriate regulatory elements and/or knocking Cre into defined genes. This is the lesson learned from Drosophila genetics and there is every reason to expect it to hold in the mouse.   [unreadable]     [unreadable] [unreadable] ',\n",
       " \"  [unreadable] Description (Provided by Applicant): GABAergic neurons regulate nearly all aspects of neural communication and computation in diverse brain regions and circuits. In addition, GABA signaling profoundly influences the development, maturation, and plasticity of the nervous system. GABAergic dysfunctions have been implicated in diseases as diverse as epilepsy, Huntington's disease, autism and schizophrenia. For decades, the heterogeneity and complexity of the GABAergic network has hampered progress in understanding their development and function. Genetically engineered mice provide an ideal system to study the GABAergic neurons, but tools for these studies are thus far limited. What is particularly needed are lines of mice in which genetic manipulations can be performed in specific classes of GABAergic neurons in restricted brain regions during a defined developmental window. We propose to achieve this goal using the Cre-loxP based binary genetic system. In the first two components of this grant (Project A&B), we will generate up to 20 driver lines expressing Cre or inducible form of Cre recombinase in different classes GABAergic neurons and their progenitors. In addition, we will construct a new generation of Cre-activated reporter mice at the Rosa26 locus to achieve high level GFP expression by incorporating the Gal4-UAS amplification cassettes. All driver and reporter lines will be generated in the C57BL/6 strain. In the third component (Project C), we will characterize and validate these driver and reporter lines and establish a web-based platform for disseminating the mice, related reagents, and data obtained from the mice to other investigators. These GABAergic Cre drivers and related reporter lines will significantly accelerate progress in understanding nearly all aspects of the normal development and function of the GABAergic system, and the etiology of a variety of debilitating brain diseases.

       " '  [unreadable] DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although antidepressants are the mainstay of treatment for depressed elderly, regimens are often problematic and undermined by high prescription drug costs. The new Medicare drug benefit represents an unprecedented opportunity to address these costs; however there are enormous pressures to contain expenditures by patient cost-sharing. Medication Therapy Management (MTM) programs will also be administered by pharmacists. It is unclear how these drug coverage changes, cost-containment strategies, and MTM programs will impact antidepressant use, quality, health, and economic outcomes in extremely vulnerable elderly with depression. After careful consideration of all reviewer comments of our first submission, we propose a multi-faceted approach using controlled time-series analyses of several large, representative databases, to shed light on the following Medicare drug coverage impacts:  [unreadable]  - Immediate changes in antidepressant use, including in important subgroups (e.g., with no prior drug coverage) and time periods (e.g., \"Doughnut Holes\" between initial coverage and catastrophic coverage).  [unreadable]  - Changes in antidepressant prescribing quality and whether any impacts differ depending upon the type of drug cost-sharing measures used?  [unreadable]  - Impacts on health outcomes experienced by antidepressant users, including the need for emergency care, hospitalizations, and nursing home admissions  [unreadable]  - Impacts on the most vulnerable elderly subgroups, such as those with low incomes, poor health status and functioning, and specific comorbidities.

Two samples will be studied: 3,000 SZ and 3,000 control subjects of European ancestry (EA), and 1,200 cases and 1,200 controls of African-American (AA) ancestry.

The Affymetrix consortium site will genotype the remaining 1550/1550 EA cases/controls with the 500K array, and all EA subjects with the 50K chip. Preliminary statistical studies are proposed, to select an optimal data analysis strategy that tests every HapMap SNP using single- and multi-marker tests, evaluates evidence for association on European- and African-ancestry chromosomes (after inferring local ancestry in admixed individuals) and in the combined data, controls for subtle population substructure, and evaluates empirical p-values through permutation. A set of\" 15 candidate intervals will be selected based on p-value threshold, Rank Truncated Product analysis, replication experiments, and bioinformatic and biological information. Deep resequencing experiments will detect any significant case-control difference in rare functional mutations, and will discover new rare and common SNPs. Further genotyping of each region will include rare/functional SNPs and additional common SNPs for optimal tagging of common variants. Based on evidence for association and available information about each gene, the associated genomic interval, and the associated variants, biological studies will be undertaken to begin to evaluate the functional effects of these variants and the implications for hypothesis about mechanisms underlying susceptibility to SZ.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention is a major hurdle in the development of novel anti-inflammatory therapies. Fortunately, the identification of intracellular receptor proteins of biologically active natural products is yielding new targets for drug development. Recently, one promising anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and anti-tumor diterpene triepoxide containing natural product, triptolide, from the Chinese medicine herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, has been shown to block NF-kappaB-mediated transcription. Interestingly, unlike the vast majority of anti-inflammatory agents, triptolide does not inhibit NFkappaB nuclear translocation or DNA binding but rather inhibits its transcriptional activating ability. The mechanism for this unique mode of NF-kappaB inhibition remains unknown.  Taking a multi-disciplinary approach, we propose to explore the molecular mechanisms of triptolide's antiinflammatory and anti-proliferative activity through the purification and characterization of triptolide-binding proteins. A careful biological/biochemical validation of these triptolide binding activities will greatly aid our understanding of triptolide's potent anti-inflammatory effects and in the basic biology of NF-kappaB transcriptional activation. In addition, this information and that gained from the further exploration of the triptolide-sensitive inflammatory signaling pathway(s) may provide the basis for the development of novel anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative drugs.\",\n",

       " 'EXCEED THE SPACE PROVIDED. The long-rangeobjectiveof this projectis to preventprogressionof diabetic nephropathy, the leading causeof end-stagerenal disease (ESRD). In most patientsdiabeticnephropathyprogresses inexorablyto ESRD despite inhibitionof the renin-angiotensin-aldosteronesystem withangiotensin convertingenzyme inhibitors(ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers(ARBs). The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) recruita multiethnicohortof 72 young adults (ages20-40) withtype 1 (n=36) or type2 (n=36) diabetesand overt nephropathy(defined as a urinealbumin/creatinineratio > 300 mg albumin/g creatinine)and randomize in a doubleblind fashion to a controlgroup consisting of ACEI-based therapy alone (ramipril40 mg once daily) or one of two experimentalgroups: a) ACEI + ARB (ramipril40 mg once dailyplusIosartan100 mg once daily)or b) ACEI + mineralocorticoid receptorantagonist (MRA) (ramipril40 mg oncedaily plusspironolactone25 mg once daily);2) conducta 12-month prospective studyto determine if proteinuriais reducedto a greater extent when eitherthe ARB or MRA is added toACEi-based therapy. This studyis poweredto detecta 40%  greater reductionin 24-hour urine albumin/creatinineratioin either experimentalgroupversus control  (alpha= 0.05, beta=0.20, repeated measures analysisof variance). Secondaryendpointsto be  examinedinclude:(a) serum potassiumand creatinineto assess safety, (b) TGF-beta, as a  surrogatemarkerfor ongoingrenal injury,(c) plasma reninactivity,angiotensinII andaldosterone levels and (d) plasma lipids and lipoprotein composition; and 3) perform repeated ambulatory blood  pressure monitoring (ABPM) to examine the renoprotective effect of the 3 different regimens at  comparable 24-hour BP of < 125/75 mmHg. The deliverables include: 1) documentation of the safety of maximal dose combination therapy; 2) the feasibility of utilizing 24-hr ABPM to establish BP  independent renoprotective effects of specific antihypertensive therapies; and 3) provide preliminary  data for future large-scale studies to test efficacy and safety of combining ACEi with MIRAtherapy on  renal outcomes.

       " 'The global mission of the Developmental Resource for Biophysical Imaging         and Optoelectronics is creation, development, facilitation and application       of new technologies for the visualization and measurement of molecular           mechanisms of dynamic cell processes with the aim of solving fundamental         problems in biomedical research. Modern advances in optical physics, and         laser and computer technologies have enabled a revolution in light               microscopy leading to unprecedented instrumentation capabilities. Non            linear laser developed in the Resource microscopies provide sub-micron,          three-dimensionally resolved fluorescence imaging and photoexcited point         pharmacology and measurements probing molecular dynamics, diffusion and          biochemical kinetics in living cells. Microinterferometry combines with          laser optical traps to enable development of optical force microscopy at         the picoNewton level. Research applications, usually through                     collaborations with various biomedical scientists probe molecular                mechanisms of receptor and second messenger signalling in allergic and           immunological responses. The dynamics of intramolecular reorganization,          conformational transformations and protein folding are explored by               measurements of intramolecular fluctuations. Molecular mobility and              motility, cytoplasmic calcium sequestration and signalling are visualized        and measured to observe molecular mechanisms underlying global cellular          responses such as those enabling such essential functions as wound               healing, heart muscle contraction, cholesterol regulation, hormonal              responses, sensory detection of sound and synaptic plasticity as                 implicated in mechanisms of memory and learning.

       " 'The global mission of the Developmental Resource for Biophysical Imaging and Optoelectronics is creation, development, facilitation and application of new technologies for the visualization and measurement of molecular mechanisms of dynamic cell processes with the aim of solving fundamental problems in biomedical research. Modern advances in optical physics, and laser and computer technologies have enabled a revolution in light microscopy leading to unprecedented instrumentation capabilities. Non linear laser developed in the Resource microscopies provide sub-micron, three-dimensionally resolved fluorescence imaging and photoexcited point pharmacology and measurements probing molecular dynamics, diffusion and biochemical kinetics in living cells. Microinterferometry combines with laser optical traps to enable development of optical force microscopy at the picoNewton level. Research applications, usually through collaborations with various biomedical scientists probe molecular mechanisms of receptor and second messenger signalling in allergic and immunological responses. The dynamics of intramolecular reorganization, conformational transformations and protein folding are explored by measurements of intramolecular fluctuations. Molecular mobility and motility, cytoplasmic calcium sequestration and signalling are visualized and measured to observe molecular mechanisms underlying global cellular responses such as those enabling such essential functions as wound healing, heart muscle contraction, cholesterol regulation, hormonal responses, sensory detection of sound and synaptic plasticity as implicated in mechanisms of memory and learning.

       " \"Contractile function is depressed for prolonged periods in reversibly injured, viable myocardium following relatively brief coronary occlusions.  Although recognized as an important clinical problem, the pathophysiological mechanisms of this myocardial 'stunning' are controversial.  We have developed and characterized an isolated working guinea-pig heart model of stunning.  In these hearts, the energy-yielding substrate pyruvate produces marked, parallel enhancements of ventricular performance and myocytic energy level (cytosolic ATP phosphorylation potential and Gibbs free energy of ATP hydrolysis).  The overall goal of this research is to delineate the subcellular mechanisms responsible for these energy-linked functional improvements.  Myocardial function is controlled in large measure by the Ca2+ pumping activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase.  Our preliminary findings indicate that pyruvate-energization enhances sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+_ transport in non-ischemic heart.  Project one will test the hypothesis that cytosolic energization stimulates Ca2+ uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum in post-ischemic 'stunned' myocardium.  Cytosolic energy level in 'stunned' guinea-pig hearts will be varied by altering substrate composition of perfusion media or by beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol, and Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ ATPase activity will be quantitated in sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from stop-frozen hearts. Project two will test the hypothesis that substrate-enhancement of sarcoplasmic reticular function stems from increased phospholamban phosphorylation, a well-characterized mechanism for beta-adrenergic stimulation of cardiac inotropism.  To effect radiolabelling of cardiac phosphoproteins, intramyocytic high-energy phosphate pools will be labelled by perfusion with [32P]inorganic phosphate; during tracer-free washout, cardiac inotropism will be increased by pyruvate-energization or by beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol.  Proteins in isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum will be separated by electrophoresis, and 32P incorporation detected and quantitated by autoradiography and scintillation counting.  This investigation will delineate the bioenergetic mechanisms for the observed highly significant relationship between contractility and cytosolic energy level in normoxic and especially 'stunned' myocardium in the absence of adrenergic stimulation.  Of special clinical interest, pyruvate energization may be effective in reversing postischemic impairment of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport.  Since pyruvate, unlike catecholamines, increases cytosolic energy level, this investigation may indicate that pyruvate could be a valuable cardioprotective intervention in clinical situations of energy-depleted heart. \",\n",

A potential catalyst for such reactions is myeloperoxidase, a hemoprotein secreted by activated phagocytes.  We now report that activated neutrophils utilize the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-chloride system to convert L-tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.  Production of p-hydroiyphenylaceta1dehyde was nearly quantitative at physiological concentrations of L-tyrosine and chloride.  Aldehyde generation required myeloperoxidase, H2tO2 L-tyrosine, and chloride ion; it was inhibited by the 11,0, scavenger catalase and by the heme poisons azide and cyanide.  Phorbol ester- and calcium ionophore-stimulated human neutrophils likewise generated p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde from L-tyrosine by a pathway inhibited by azide, cyanide, and catalase. Aldehyde production accounted for 75% of 11,02 generated by optimally stimulated neutrophils at plasma concentrations of ~tyrosine and chloride.  Collectively, these results indicate that activated phagocytes, under physiological conditions, utilize myeloperoxidase to execute the chloride.dependent conversion of L-tyrosine to the lipid-soluble aldehyde, p.hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, in near quantitative yield.

       " 'Porphyrins, essential constituents of many important biological systems, have functioned favorably ina  variety of novel chemical and medicinal procedures; most recently as sensitizers in photochemical reactions and in uses as magnetic imaging contrast and cancer therapy agents.  Consequently, there are concerted efforts toward synthesizing porphyrins that exhibit ideal solution behavior.  Placing electron-affinic substituents (i.e. halogens) and alkyl groups on the peripheral of porphyrin rings influences the porphyrin chemical properties.  Research objectives are to synthesize water-soluble tetraphenylporphyrins and related tetraarylporphyrins and investigate their solution properties.  Compounds have been synthesized that contain halide substituents as well as alkyl substituted derivatives.  Most recently efforts were directed toward the synthesis of water-soluble porphyrin containing fluorine substituents.  Tetrakis(2-fluoro-3- sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TFPPS4) an Tetrakis(2,6-difluorlo-3- sulfonatophenyl)- porphyrin (TF2PPS4)) were obtained by sulfonating the halo substituted phenyl rings of Tetrakis(2-fluoro- phenyl) porphyrin (TFPP) and Tetrakis(2,6-difluorophenyl)porphyrin (TF2PP) respectively.  Current efforts are directed toward the synthesis of highly electronegative water-soluble tetraphenylporphyrins, Tetrakis(2,3,4-trifluoro-4- sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TF3PPS4)2Tetrakis(2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4- sulfonato- phenyl)porphyrin (TF4PPS4) and/or mixed phenyl/halophenyl derivatives of these targeted porphyrins.  Spectrophotometric aqueous pH titrations of these novel porphyrins will be carried out to determine acid and equilibrium constants.  Reaction rates and thermodynamic data will be obtained from appropriate kinetics investigations.  NMR spectroscopy will be employed to assist in the elucidation of porphyrin structures.  Additionally, the aqueous behavior of these porphyrins chelated with biologically important transition metals will be investigated.  Lastly, optical and NMR spectroscopy data will be collected to determine peripheral charge efforts on porphyrins kinetic solution behavior, and the effect of, and the degree of coordination of strongly and weakly coordinating ligands to metalloporphyrins.

       " 'Natural products provide a wide range of biologically active agents,             many of which have unique profiles of pharmacological activity and               therapeutic potential.  Over four hundred alkaloids have been                    identified in extracts from amphibian skins.  These include                      batrachotoxins, which are potent activators of sodium channels,                  histrionicotoxins, which are noncompetitive blockers of nicotinic                receptor channel complexes and potassium channels, pumiliotoxins,                which have myotonic and cardiotonic activity due to effects on sodium            channels, and epibatidine, an extremely potent and selective nicotinic           agonist with remarkable antinociceptive activity.  Further alkaloids             include 2,5-disubstituted decahydroquinolines, 3,5-disubstituted                 pyrrolizidines , 3,5-disubstituted indolizidines, 5,8-disubstituted              indolizidines, 1,4-disubstituted and 4,6-disubstituted quinolizidines,           the pumiliotoxin-homopumiliotoxin-allopumiliotoxin class, and a                  variety of tricyclic alkaloids, including pyrrolizidine oximes,                  pseudophrynamines, cyclopentaquinolizidines and coccinellines.  Most             of these alkaloids have been detected and characterized from                     neotropical dendrobatid frogs.  Pumiliotoxins also occur in one genus            of Australian myobatrachid frogs, in one genus of South American                 bufonid toads and in one genus of Madagascan mantellid frogs.  It                appears all frog skin alkaloids have a dietary origin, being taken up            and sequestered unchanged into skin glands.  Ants, beetles and                   millipedes appear to be the source of certain frog skin alkaloids.               Decahydroquinolines have now been discovered in ants.   The origin of            the batrachotoxins, histrionicotoxins, pumiliotoxins, and epibatidines           found in frog skin remains a mystery.  Structures have now been                  determined for a 1,4-disubstituted quinolizidine, a trisubstituted               indolizidine, a novel tricyclic alkaloid related to the coccinellines,           a dimeric decahydroquinoline, a set of nineteen-carbon                           decahydroquinolines from frogs and ants and an oxirane-containing                allopumiliotoxin.  Spiropyrrolizidine oximes, pseudophrynaminol, a               series of tropane alkaloids (potential muscarinic/nicotinic agonists)            and a methylisooxazole analog (epiboxidine) of the potent nicotinic              analgetic epibatidine have been synthesized for biological evaluation.
